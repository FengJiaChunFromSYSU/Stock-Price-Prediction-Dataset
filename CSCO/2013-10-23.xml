GRO's 80.81% owned subsidiary Agria Asia owns 379.1mm PGW.NZ shares, which equals 50.22% of PGW.NZ's shares outstanding. PGW.NZ is currently NZ$0.39 per share, valuing Agria Asia's stake at NZ$147.85mm or USD$125.67mm. GRO's 80.81% interest in Agria Asia values GRO's stake at $101.56mm. GRO only has 55.38mm shares outstanding. If we divide $101.56mm by 55.38mm, GRO will likely rapidly rise by at least 25% to a minimum of $1.83 per share, so that its market cap equals the current market value of its stake in PGW.NZ. GRO also owns 100% of a China seeds business with $17mm in revenues and 98% revenue growth. Including GRO's China seeds business, GRO deserves to be trading well above $2. GRO's CEO Alan Lai was just yesterday appointed the Chairman of PGW.NZ, and he has previously expressed interest in merging PGW.NZ's international seeds business into GRO's booming China seeds business, which could increase the value of GRO tremendously. The majority of GRO's debt listed on its balance sheet is actually debt of PGW.NZ, which currently has a very healthy debt level. GRO only has $75mm of its own debt, with $32mm of it not maturing until May 2018. GRO's $43mm in short-term debt is already backed by $26.8mm in pledged restricted cash deposits, leaving only $16.2mm in short-term debt that GRO will need to pay back from its current cash position of $42.7mm. GRO received $8.33mm in fiscal 2013 cash dividends from PGW.NZ and could receive much larger annual dividends from PGW.NZ moving forward. By the time GRO's $32mm loan matures in 2018, GRO's cash position could easily be $65-$85mm.</Msg><Username>dangu583</Username><Timestamp>1382509243565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 02:20:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382527059144-4</Id><Title>Tea Party no more POPULAR than the KLAN in FLORIDA</Title><Msg>Good to know!</Msg><Username>the_fake_id_guy</Username><Timestamp>1382527059144</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 07:17:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382527139750-5</Id><Topic><Title>I want to give all my money to the government</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1382475143492</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-22 16:52:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't have enough money for that son.

Rationalism coming out of Texas? They got flying swine too? It appears that science is prevailing in the latest battle over Texas schoolbooks. Though earlier this year several of the state’s textbook reviewers called for biology textbooks to discuss creationism, publishers are not complying with those requests, according to the Texas Freedom Network. The nonpartisan watchdog examined material made public by the Texas Education Agency and found that publishers are sticking with teaching evolution. Citizens who serve on the Texas review panels are charged with making suggestions about proposed classroom texts that are being considered for the state's list of “approved” schoolbooks. While most reviewers on this year’s biology panel made routine, noncontroversial suggestions, some took issue with the fact that the proposed books did not include information about creationism while focusing on evolution. However, information that publishers submitted to the Texas Education Agency show they are not incorporating the suggestions about "creation science" and plan to print books free of references to the theory of intelligent design. Link Of course, since this is Texas, there's always a caveat: In November, the Texas Board of Education will decide which books it will recommend for schools to use. It's not clear how the failure to include creationism will impact the recommended list. However, even if specific textbooks are not recommended, school districts will still have the option of using them. Still, these publishers refusing to codify superstition has to be considered a good thing, and it's Texas.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382532780283</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 08:53:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382532863347-22</Id><Title>One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Cisco Systems</Title><Msg>These tips are really good.

I’d say you ought to say no the Girl Scout cookies too. I don’t want to support lesbianism, I don’t want to support Planned Parenthood and I don’t want to support abortion, and if that be the case I’m not buying Girl Scout Cookies.” By promoting an organization that empowers women to think for themselves is a quickest way to ensure that -- you guessed it -- Communists will seize control of the U.S. government. “I think we understand why Barack Obama is president of the United States. He is incredibly popular with single women, incredibly popular. In fact, if you want a Communist in the White House in the year 2020, you have got to get more daughters raised with the worldview, the independent mindset, the worldview that is presented by the Girl Scouts of America.” After all any organization that makes girls independent and able to think for themselves must be evil.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382532913138</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 08:55:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382533432862-24</Id><Topic><Title>FAKE Story on Hannity by couple that was forced to drop Healthcare- they only have 4 employees though</Title><Username>the_fake_id_guy</Username><Timestamp>1382531486820</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 08:31:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Best Affordable Care Act News You’ll Hear This Week October 22nd, 2013 11:23 am Jason Sattler 31 While the left is focused on the Republican Party’s miserable post-shutdown poll numbers and the right is celebrating the flaws in Healthcare.gov, the biggest and brightest news for the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has come out of the nation’s most crucial swing state. Ohio has become the 25th state to accept the ACA’s Medicaid expansion, which was made optional to the states in a 2012 Supreme Court ruling. What is extraordinary about the Buckeye State’s acceptance of the program — which will allow residents earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level to receive subsidized health care — is how hard Governor John Kasich (R-OH) pushed for expansion, and how he did it. Ohio’s Republican-dominated state legislature rejected Medicaid expansion three times earlier this year, after Kasich became one of about a half-dozen Republican governors who signaled he wanted his state to embrace the ACA provision. Instead of accepting defeat, the governor took the matter to the Controlling Board, an obscure entity that normally handles small budgetary matters. More than three dozen Republican legislators protested this move to circumvent the legislature. The board voted 5-2 on Monday to accept $2.5 billion in federal funds for expansion to cover up to 275,000 Ohioans. Kasich — who during the 1990s was the chairman of the House Budget Committee that produced the first balanced budget in decades — prepared his state for Monday’s vote by waging a public relations campaign for expansion that took two of the right’s most cherished symbols and used them to advance President Obama’s signature legislative achievement. The governor continually invoked Ronald Reagan and “Christian compassion” as he argued for providing health insurance for the working poor. This further enraged right-wingers, who favor using the Gipper’s image to push lower taxes and Christian fundamentalism to push conservative stands on social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. Republican governors in states like Ohio that President Obama won have a hard time turning down expansion for a simple reason: They’d like to keep their jobs. It’s also a great deal for the states, with the federal government paying 100 percent of the coverage at the outset with that percentage tapering down to 90 percent by the end of the decade. The federal government currently pays about 57 percent of the cost of Medicaid. States that reject the program will have to provide the tax revenue to pay for it anyway, without the coverage that should keep the working poor out of emergency rooms and drive down insurance rates for all residents.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382533432862</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 09:03:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382533515324-25</Id><Topic><Title>The war on women continues</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382532913138</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 08:55:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wonder why Dumb is busy acting stupid on the net ?

Some misinterpreted the magazine’s position on the website to mean it had turned against President Obama’s signature legislation. Not so fast. Here’s the full article from Consumer Reports: Pundits opposed to the new health care law and some media outlets have tried to suggest that our coverage of the troubled HealthCare.gov site means that Consumer Reports has turned against the Affordable Care Act. Not true. Consistent with our mission to inform and protect consumers, particularly in this complicated health care market, our advice remains the same: The best place to buy coverage on your own is through the Health Insurance Marketplace in your state. That guarantees you will get comprehensive coverage, and it’s the only way you can lower the cost of your premiums and possibly even your deductibles and copayments. Doing that online in most states means registering at and shopping through the federal HealthCare.gov. President Obama acknowledged that site’s problems at a Rose Garden event today. “Nobody’s madder than me about the fact the website isn’t working as well as it should,” he said. “Which means it’s going to be fixed. And in the meantime you can bypass the website and apply by phone or in person.” (To do that, go to Find Local Help, part of HealthCare.gov.) Millions of Americans can go directly to their state’s marketplace, including residents of California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Those who will have to go through HealthCare.gov need to apply by Dec. 15 for coverage to start on Jan. 1, 2014. Open enrollment runs through the end of March 2014.

It's not going to be a significant number to those who can't afford insurance. The poor will pay the tax. For example, a person making 100K a year would pay $1000/year if he didn't have insurance, but would still be entitled to Emergency care if he walks into an ER. It's a small fee to go without insurance. Of course, it represents an immediate bonus to those who get insurance.

My son, who is currently in the U.S., had an cycling accident in Montana and was treated in Northern Idaho. He had to have major stitches on his foot. The bill was over $600 for something that would have been treated as part of the national scheme down here and would have cost less than one third of the cost in the U.S. Fortunately for my son, the doctor waived the bill under some local (northern Idaho) program, but we were going to pay the bill to avoid any legal action against our son as his travel insurance had expired. When I was in the U.S. a few weeks ago, I lost an asthma puffer and when I looked into replacing it in Oregon, I was told I needed a doctor's prescription and $95 for a single puffer. Something is very wrong in the U.S. when an item so common and important in the treatment of asthma costs 10 times more than it costs in other countries. An asthma puffer in Australia is less than $10 and can be purchased over the counter. Thank goodness Australia has a pharmaceutical benefits scheme that keeps the cost of medication within reason. The folks who cry 'socialism' whenever 'Obamacare' is mentioned need to have an objective look at how health care operates in other countries because caring for your citizens should not be a profit industry, it should be caring and compassionate field. If Mr Romney genuinely cared about the American people, he would back this compassionate policy. He and his fellow republicans should be ashamed for turning a caring and sensible policy into an evil and unaffordable policy.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382561979639</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 16:59:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382562101617-248</Id><Topic><Title>In the real non rabbit hole world</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382561979639</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 16:59:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the existing competitive market place is working very well for (the hospitals and insurance companies) so we should continue paying 5 times what the rest of the world does FOR EXACTLY THE SAME THING, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382562101617</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-23 17:01:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382562174369-249</Id><Title>the real world</Title><Msg>This is a great plan I work for a small business that Blue Cross blue shield dropped because we had older women working and the premium became so high we could not afford it, but under the Inclusive Health plan we all have insurance again even women with diabetics and older males that smoke, they are better off because they can all afford to see a doctor regularly and can afford their medications again, which keeps them healthier and able to work and have preventive care rather than more expensive catastrophic care. I myself was diagnosed with breast cancer while I was uninsured and have a huge hospital bill to pay but under inclusive health plan everything from Oct 1, 2012 is covered even if the cancer comes back. the recommenced drug for estrogen blocking was $89 a month under the plan it is $10.00.
