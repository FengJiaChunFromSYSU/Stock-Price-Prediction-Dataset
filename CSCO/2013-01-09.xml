In the early 70's Scientists were WARNING that we were heading into a coming mini ice age. That was just 40 years ago, they CLAIMED their data showed a decades long COOLING trend. They even had a graph in the Smithsonion that had to be covered up. OOPSIEEEE Now because you have a couple of decades showing a warming trend you tree hugging fruitloops now claim we are all going to be burned off the earth. I think I have successfully showed who the real nutjob is here. The earth is MILLIONS of years old and is and has gone through up and down cycles throughout.

A survey of 3146 earth scientists asked the question "Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?" (Doran 2009). More than 90% of participants had Ph.D.s, and 7% had master’s degrees. Overall, 82% of the scientists answered yes. However, what are most interesting are responses compared to the level of expertise in climate science. Of scientists who were non-climatologists and didn't publish research, 77% answered yes. In contrast, 97.5% of climatologists who actively publish research on climate change responded yes. As the level of active research and specialization in climate science increases, so does agreement that humans are significantly changing global temperatures. Most striking is the divide between expert climate scientists (97.4%) and the general public (58%). The paper concludes: "It seems that the debate on the authenticity of global warming and the role played by human activity is largely nonexistent among those who understand the nuances and scientific basis of long-term climate processes. The challenge, rather, appears to be how to effectively communicate this fact to policy makers and to a public that continues to mistakenly perceive debate among scientists."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357739549750</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 08:52:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357739629169-9</Id><Topic><Title>Flatearther Dumb Dumb Ivan says a 1 degree increase</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1357700409097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 22:00:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Scientific organizations endorsing the consensus The following scientific organizations endorse the consensus position that "most of the global warming in recent decades can be attributed to human activities": American Association for the Advancement of Science American Astronomical Society American Chemical Society American Geophysical Union American Institute of Physics American Meteorological Society American Physical Society Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society Australian Bureau of Meteorology and the CSIRO British Antarctic Survey Canadian Foundation for Climate and Atmospheric Sciences Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society Environmental Protection Agency European Federation of Geologists European Geosciences Union European Physical Society Federation of American Scientists Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies Geological Society of America Geological Society of Australia Geological Society of London International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics National Center for Atmospheric Research National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Royal Meteorological Society Royal Society of the UK The Academies of Science from 19 different countries all endorse the consensus. 13 countries have signed a joint statement endorsing the consensus position: Academia Brasiliera de Ciencias (Brazil) Royal Society of Canada Chinese Academy of Sciences Academie des Sciences (France) Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina (Germany) Indian National Science Academy Accademia dei Lincei (Italy) Science Council of Japan Academia Mexicana de Ciencias (Mexico) Russian Academy of Sciences Academy of Science of South Africa Royal Society (United Kingdom) National Academy of Sciences (USA) (12 Mar 2009 news release) A letter from 18 scientific organizations to US Congress states: "Observations throughout the world make it clear that climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are the primary driver.

Editorial by James A. Peden (Excerpts) – “After the hockey stick was accepted virtually overnight without close examination ( like the Piltdown Man ), along comes Al Gore, a long-time “environmentalist”, ( who made near-failing grades in science and math in college ) who decides to make a movie out of it. The hockey stick goes up on the big screen, and Gore boards a mechanical lift with cameras grinding, pointer in hand as he rises in unison with the blade of the stick which starts growing upward toward the ceiling. No longer are we talking about tenths of a degree, the temperature is rising like a puff pastry, and headed toward the attic. It all began with the word “if”. If the hockey stick tip continues to rise (lift starts going upward, the audience holds its breath ) then… and along comes computer animations of New York flooding, Florida underwater, and poor little Polar Bears struggling to board the last piece of ice floating in the open Arctic Sea. (sigh…) It ends with Hurricane Katrina and Boston almost losing the pennant. It is Hollywood at its finest, and the Deacons of La La Land give it an Oscar. Even the Nobel Committee is impressed, gives it two thumbs-up and a Nobel Prize to Gore and the other members of the IPCC for the many lives that will be saved in the future because of this brilliant early warning. Making, perhaps, Al Gore the richest former Vice President in history And, there’s still time for we miserable humans to “save” the planet by buying “carbon offsets” accomplished best by investing in Al Gore’s British company which buys stock in other companies that will benefit from a world-wide global warming hysteria (keeping a healthy cut) and making, perhaps, Al Gore the richest former Vice President in history. That will buy a lot of SUV’s, jets, and large mansions with mega-electric bills. Everyone wins except the taxpayer and businessman, who are soon to pay a very heavy price.” The most likely culprit? Our old friend, the Sun. “So what’s really causing the endless cycles of warming and cooling, if it isn’t a constantly changing “Greenhouse Effect” – with man to blame? Man wasn’t producing much CO2 in the past million years, so he hasn’t simply been turning the greenhouse up and down at will. Just look up – one of the most likely culprits is our old friend, the Sun.” About the editor James A. Peden – better known as Jim or “Dad” – Webmaster of Middlebury Networks and Editor of the Middlebury Community Network, spent some of his earlier years as an Atmospheric Physicist at the Space Research and Coordination Center in Pittsburgh and Extranuclear Laboratories in Blawnox, Pennsylvania, studying ion-molecule reactions in the upper atmosphere. As a student, he was elected to both the National Physics Honor Society and the National Mathematics Honor Fraternity, and was President of the Student Section of the American Institute of Physics. He was a founding member of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry, and a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. His thesis on charge transfer reactions in the upper atmosphere was co-published in part in the prestigious Journal of Chemical Physics. The results obtained by himself and his colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh remain today as the gold standard in the AstroChemistry Database. He was a co-developer of the Modulated Beam Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer, declared one of the “100 Most Significant Technical Developments of the Year” and displayed at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1357740436493</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 09:07:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357741201368-12</Id><Title>Fluteman sites as an expert, to refute global warming</Title><Msg>A man who hasn't published a scientific paper in 40 years.

Their theory was the earth, if it followed past patterns, was due to go into a global cooling period.

I gave you a perfect example of a group of scientists who claim just the opposite of what you say is fact. I'm TRYING to explain to you that everything is not always as it seems. I suppose there were people who questioned those scientists from the 70's and there were also people LIKE YOU who made fun of them because they QUESTIONED.

You want to call man made global warming a FACT based on UNDER 100 years of data on a model that is MILLIONS of years old." Well flute, you probably would have had to go to high school to learn scientific method. You create a theory like, the 29 gigatons of CO2 man produces now annually, only 40% of which is absorbed, should, given our understanding of chemistry and it's interaction of sunlight, mean the earth will retain more heat then when CO2 levels were lower and should result in an increase in the earths average temperature, all other variables held constant. You then take your logical scientific theory and see if there is scientific data that supports your thesis. And of course it does, in the real world.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357743987114</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 10:06:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357744014034-27</Id><Title>Just wondering,which type of flute does the fluteman prefer</Title><Msg>blowing?I'm guessing the skin flute.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1357744014034</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 10:06:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357744082427-28</Id><Title>SO, back to Cisco</Title><Msg>I made an observation yesterday that Cisco had a spike in volume and price late in the day that started around 3pm.

Do you get one of those with your food stamps in Chicago or do you have to be rich like Tiger Woods to afford one which would put my finances into a black hole if true?

If AIG decides to join the complaint, which seeks $25 billion in damages, it would pit the company against the government that in 2008 kept it from buckling under the weight huge losses on mortgage-backed securities and other toxic assets.

Bush's $4 trillion increase over eight years. The White House requested authority earlier this month to raise the debt ceiling to $16.4 trillion, up $1.2 trillion from last summer and more than $5 trillion from the statutory limit of $11.3 trillion set in October 2008 before Obama took office. The debt at the time Obama entered the White House was $10.6 trillion. The ceiling was raised to $12.1 trillion within a month of his inauguration. Such increases used to be anathema to Obama, who voted in March 2006 along with all his Senate Democratic colleagues against Bush's hike of the debt ceiling to $8.9 trillion. At the time, Obama called raising the debt limit "a sign of leadership failure." Out on the campaign trail in July 2008, he suggested the move was downright un-American.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357765526841</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:05:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357765699842-172</Id><Topic><Title>Flute imposter completely lost it</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1357756750107</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 13:39:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just the Surf ID?

Chavez recently underwent his fourth cancer-related surgery in Cuba and there is wide speculation that the 58-year-old — at the very least — will never again be able to govern. His allies have postponed his inauguration for a new presidential term, originally scheduled for Thursday, prompting a fierce battle with the Venezuelan opposition. Tomorrow, January 10, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was scheduled to be sworn in for his third term in office before Venezuela’s National Assembly. There is only one problem. Chavez has not been seen or heard from in any official capacity since December 11 when he left Venezuela to undergo an undisclosed form of cancer surgery in Cuba. As the countdown to the inauguration continues, speculation has grown that Chavez is dead or dying, prompting questions about the future of his administration and what implications his demise might have on the stability of Venezuela.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1357776077596</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 19:01:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357776513473-190</Id><Topic><Title>Who will obama blame when debt ceiling comes</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357761894496</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 15:04:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I noticed that as well one day, But I just took a shower and didn't feel DIRTY like a dim lib to make a BIG deal about spelling...</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1357776513473</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 19:08:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357776568202-191</Id><Topic><Title>Who will obama blame when debt ceiling comes</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357761894496</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 15:04:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe she'll drop a O-LARDO's Mama's baby.

Incredible that somehow the swift boated him instead of thanking him for exposing this #$%$ that we still carry out around the world in different wars.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1357786284505</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 21:51:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357788830855-207</Id><Topic><Title>HAGEL WON'T PASS CONFIRMATION</Title><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1357585342712</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 14:02:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Posters like Surf should wonder why most who served in Vietnam have no use for Kerry. Perhaps he should think maybe they know more than he does. In all wars there are some instances of atrocities. My Lai in Vietnam and Abu Graib in Iraq are two instances. But I don' t believe there was the rampant malfeasance that Kerry claimed. And I assume thats why most Vietnam veterans resent him so much. The vast majority served honorably and Kerry besmirched all of them because of a very few.And I suspect that was to promote his career.</Msg><Username>redangel6666</Username><Timestamp>1357788830855</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 22:33:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357790446211-208</Id><Topic><Title>obama refuses to control 20 million illegals</Title><Username>eagle1776321</Username><Timestamp>1357759553138</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 14:25:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>98% of Americans want US citizenship be given to the 20 million undocumented imigrants and want Obama to import more undocumented imigrants. White people are not having enough kids (future taxpayers) while undocumented imigrants have 8 or more kids(future taxpayers) per family.
