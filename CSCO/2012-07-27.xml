Its a great trading stock for the up/down cycles, but it hasn't been a hold. Its fundamentally cheaper now than it has ever been in the past dozen years, and no doubt once again will get another run over $20. Question is - does it go lower before it goes higher? I can't pick bottoms but I can slowly accumulate at depressed levels and wait for the next rise. Cisco is an accumulate on weakness without a doubt imo.</Msg><Username>gordonfan4life2</Username><Timestamp>1343362306365</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 00:11:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343366092447-2</Id><Title>ENTIRE UK SAYS "WHO IS THIS IDIOT ?"</Title><Msg>You send this idiot to the UK and he insults our closest ally ? #$%$br /&gt; Bumbling idiot like G.W. what an embarrassment !

"It's unbelievable, it's beyond human understanding, it's incomprehensible. I'm out of adjectives," he lamented. He said the purpose of Romney's trip was merely to express solidarity with America's British allies, and say nice things about his foreign hosts. "All Romney has to do, say nothing," Krauthammer said. "It’s like a guy in the 100-meter dash. All he has to do is to finish, he doen’t have to win. And instead, he tackles the guy in the lane next to him and ends up disqualified. I don’t get it." Later, Krauthammer also questioned the Romneys' choice to enter Ann's horse into the Olympics. "I'm not sure why the horse has to be in the most upper-class hoity-toity Olympic event ever invented. It's unnecessary," he said.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343398482067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 10:14:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343398533267-30</Id><Topic><Title>UK OVERWHELMED BY ROMNEY!!

Mitt’s gaffes have been occurring almost hourly and the Republican presidential nominee is now being dubbed Mr. Bean. He’s been stumbling around London as if he’s the half-wit love child of a Dubya/Palin love tryst. Romney’s gone from disparaging the Brits’ efforts in preparing for the Olympics to referring to the UK as “the nation of Great Britain.” (There is no such nation. Great Britain is an island consisting of three nations: England, Scotland and Wales. Along with Northern Ireland, they form the United Kingdom.)

Three percent (3%) prefer some other candidate, and four percent (4%) are undecided. The numbers are similar to the 49% to 43% advantage Romney enjoys on the question of who is trusted more to handle the economy. Seventy percent (70%) of voters see Obama as politically liberal, while 67% see Romney as a conservative. However, the president is seen as more extreme ideologically. Forty-three percent (43%) see him as Very Liberal, while just 24% believe Romney is Very Conservative. Most voters are either politically Moderate or Somewhat Conservative."

According to Romney and his fellow liars, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (they don't call it that, of course), approximately $800 billion in total, went to "friends, donors, campaign supporters, special interest groups...Solyndra ($500 million), "windmills from China," "electric cars from Finland." Of course, this is at best distorted. For instance, PolitiFact, not exactly a big friend of Democrats, found the "windmills from China" claim to be "mostly false." It further found the "electric cars from Finland" claim to be totally "false." The Washington Post's Fact Checker, also no friend of Democrats, gave the ad overall two "Pinocchios" for having "Significant omissions and/or exaggerations" (that's an understatement). Finally, see Media Matters for a complete demolition of the Romney ad, including the New York Times analysis that "much of the ad is false;" the ABC News analysis that "less than .000031 percent of the $814 billion stimulus program" went to wind turbines made in China; the Washington Post analysis that "the stimulus created about 51,000 jobs in the U.S. wind industry;" etc, etc. Bottom line: this ad is false, false, false - no matter how many times they run it on our TV screens.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343446466356</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 23:34:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343447164515-186</Id><Title>mitt the twit</Title><Msg>“Mitt the Twit” screamed Friday’s headline in The Sun, which just days ago was trumpeting an embarrassing incident in which an official bus carrying the U.S. team from Heathrow airport got lost and spent hours in traffic. “Who invited party-pooper Romney?” asked the Daily Mail. “Nowhere Man” declared the more reserved Times of London, a reference to a biting comment by the famously diplomatic Cameron, who implied that Romney lacked the experience to offer advice to one of the world’s great capitals since the Olympics he helped organize in Salt Lake City, Utah, took place “in the middle of nowhere.” “We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world.

The Olympic appearance carries special significance for Romney. His political career was born out of his leading role at the Salt Lake City Games, which were plagued by scandal before he was tapped to take over. "One of the things he talks about most is how he heroically showed up on the scene and bailed out and resolved the problems of the Salt Lake City Olympic Games," Rick Santorum, now a Romney supporter, said in February when he opposed Romney for the GOP nomination. "He heroically bailed out the Salt Lake City Olympic Games by heroically going to Congress and asking them for tens of millions of dollars to bail out the Salt Lake Games — in an earmark." Romney took over the games in 1999 after its leaders were accused of sending money to members of the International Olympic Committee to help Salt Lake City win the games. By Romney's account, the government spent about $600 million helping the Salt Lake Olympic Committee. An additional $1.1 billion was planned for projects like roads and bridges, infrastructure improvement projects that the government probably would have paid for eventually, though the timing of the games may have sped up the construction.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343447500540</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 23:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
