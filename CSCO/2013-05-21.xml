That has left little money for long-term Gulf Coast recovery projects. Although it's tricky to unravel the maze of federal reports, our best estimate of agency data is that only $35 billion has been appropriated for long-term rebuilding. Even worse, less than 42 percent of the money set aside has even been spent, much less gotten to those most in need. For example: Washington set aside $16.7 billion for Community Development Block Grants, one of the two biggest sources of rebuilding funds, especially for housing. But as of March 2007, only $1 billion - just 6 percent - had been spent, almost all of it in Mississippi. Following bad publicity, HUD spent another $3.8 billion on the program between March and July, leaving 70 percent of the funds still unused. The other major source of rebuilding help was supposed to be FEMA's Public Assistance Program. But of the $8.2 billion earmarked, only $3.4 billion was meant for nonemergency projects like fixing up schools and hospitals. Louisiana officials recently testified that FEMA has also "low-balled" project costs, underestimating the true expenses by a factor of four or five. For example, for 11 Louisiana rebuilding projects, the lowest bids came to $5.5 million - but FEMA approved only $1.9 million. After the failure of federal levees flooded 80 percent of New Orleans, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers received $8.4 billion to restore storm defenses. But as of July 2007, less than 20 percent of the funds have been spent, even as the Corps admits that levee repair won't be completed until as late as 2011. The fact that, two years later, most federal Katrina funds remain bottled up in bureaucracy is especially shocking considering that the amounts Washington allocated come nowhere near the anticipated costs of Gulf rebuilding. For example, the $3.4 billion FEMA has available to recover local public infrastructure would only cover about one-eighth of the damage suffered in Louisiana alone. But this money is spread across five states - Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas - and covers damage from three 2005 hurricanes, Katrina, Rita and Wilma.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369152915167</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 12:15:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369153167783-57</Id><Topic><Title>this board is a cesspool of fools</Title><Username>ryanturcott</Username><Timestamp>1369149371632</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 11:16:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>putting them on ignore would take hours as you have to do it every day with all the new jerks that post .. i complain to yahoo all the time but they seem to like this as they refuse to do anything about it and could care less .</Msg><Username>composerx1</Username><Timestamp>1369153167783</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 12:19:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369153191004-58</Id><Topic><Title>Didn't Obama learn anything from Katrina</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369150766741</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 11:39:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tea billies can't do math, they get all their math from FAUX news</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369153191004</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 12:19:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369153367954-59</Id><Topic><Title>IRS fessing up again</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1369151763962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 11:56:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What difference does that make ,moron??

Mr Venner, a presenter on a Catholic-traditionalust radio station and controversial historian and essayist, posted an essay on his website earlier in the day calling for "new, spectacular and symbolic actions to shake us out of our sleep, to jolt anaesthetised minds and to reawaken memory of our origins".

CCUR is providing the VOD technology being used by Time Warner Cable, Cox, Bright House, Charter, and many others.

CCUR is currently only $7 with 8.75mm o/s a market cap of $61.28 million with $22.37mm in cash and an enterprise value of $38.91mm or just 0.61X revenue of $63.23mm. CCUR's main rival Seachange (SEAC) has an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.69 and this would value CCUR at $14.76 per share! CCUR's EPS has been ramping up big time from $0.02, to $0.04, to $0.08, and to $0.11 over the past four quarters! No other stock is seeing their EPS grow this fast!

But now, suddenly, Barack Obama must come clean on all particulars, or he’s, you guessed it, the dreaded Nixon! Of course, Nixon wasn’t always the dreaded Nixon, because to the conservatives of the early 1970s who agreed 110 percent with Tricky D0rk’s claims of executive privilege, he was the heroic, stalwart Nixon.

I was diagnosed about three years ago with obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and general anxiety disorder. I believe that my OCD stems mostly from a very dysfunctional childhood and my perception that I had to be perfect in order to keep some amount of peace in my home. It eventually became more extreme and more things had to be even. Now, I don't even step on cracks, and if I do slip up, I have to step on the crack with my other foot to make it even. Living in the Arizona heat it gets a little frustrating when you are spending more time than needed in 110-degree weather! I tried medications to alleviate the problem; however, it just created more problems. I became so lethargic that I just didn't care to make things even when I could just leave the room and go take a nap. That was no way to live for me. I would rather go about my life making things even and constantly cleaning than to feel useless. I do, however, go to therapy to deal with all of my issues, and I recommend that to anyone. It's an aggravating feeling, but I made the choice to see some humor in it. I try to always keep a positive outlook, and if people look at me in confusion, I just laugh and tell them I can't help it. I have found that most people understand and actually have loved ones that deal with similar issues. I believe there are probably more people who deal with mental health issues than not. It's time to start talking about them and quit treating our problems as if they don't exist in an attempt to be "normal." We are just as normal as anybody else; we just do things a little differently!</Msg><Username>ivanhoreofloxxly</Username><Timestamp>1369158712787</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 13:51:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369158754661-97</Id><Topic><Title>Oklahoma Senators Repeatedly Opposed Disaster Relief Funds</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_7</Username><Timestamp>1369157430705</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 13:30:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's called poetic justice !</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1369158754661</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 13:52:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369158805667-98</Id><Topic><Title>Tea billies, here is a good way for you to register your outrage!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369156069114</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 13:07:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sadly, the onset of Sharia law would condemn all liberal gay marriage advocates to beheading.

He was the Minister of Propaganda, and was very skilled at manipulating and twisting around information to make it benefit him and the Nai Party. He was in charge of things like the huge burning of books after issuing lists of books that the German people was forbidden to buy or read. Everything was done to prevent the people living in Germany from reading, watching, and listening to any free information. Everything was supposed to make the German people believe that Hitler was their great leader, that the country was going to take over Europe to make it a better place, and that the Jews were wrong and bad. This propaganda was intented to control what people thought and believed. He made huge campaigns that targeted at certain groups of people, and one of those was why Germany should invade Poland. Goebbels was one of Hitler's closest advisors and he strongly believed that Hitler was always right, and this is why Hitler trusted him as much as he did. Even at the very end of the war, when Germany was losing the war and that Hitler was becoming crazy, Goebbels stayed with Hitler in a bunker, under the Chancellery in Berlin, unlike some high officers and close advisors, who tried to escape Berlin before the Allies enter the city and took over. Goebbels committed suicide with his wife (after killing their 6 children), in the bunker, one day after Hitler's suicide.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1369164692689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:31:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369164776824-119</Id><Title>Obama administration spied on Fox News reporter James Rosen</Title><Msg>The Justice Department spied extensively on Fox News reporter James Rosen in 2010, collecting his telephone records, tracking his movements in and out of the State Department and seizing two days of Rosen’s personal emails...WOW!</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1369164776824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 15:32:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369164951539-120</Id><Title>We have to pay banks for keeping our money</Title><Msg>St. Louis Fed President James Bullard suggested the Fed could take rates negative.

"That's totally different," Inhofe told cable TV network MSNBC. "Everybody was getting in and exploiting the tragedy that took place. That won't happen in Oklahoma." Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, who also opposed the Sandy appropriation because it was not offset with budget savings elsewhere, pledged to make a similar "pay-for" demand if further disaster funds were needed. For now, however, he was focused on getting aid to the victims. "As the ranking member of the Senate committee that oversees FEMA, I can assure Oklahomans that any and all available aid will be delivered without delay," Coburn said in a statement. Representative Tom Cole, the Republican congressman whose district bore the brunt of the tornado - its second major disaster due to a twister in 14 years - had no explaining to do. He supported the Sandy legislation and pledged whatever resources were necessary to recover and rebuild devastated communities.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369174535465</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 18:15:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369174765465-195</Id><Topic><Title>dead is my little minion</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369169821331</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 16:57:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dead why don't you just use one id, we all know it's you</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369174765465</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 18:19:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369175025343-196</Id><Topic><Title>dead is my little minion</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1369169821331</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 16:57:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know how to spell.

Turd Museum. The tornado came and went and left disaster in its wake. The people of Moore will recoup and go on. The W. Turd Museum at SMU will be here for awhile. A singular monument to one of the worst, most aggrievous governments and administrations the world has ever known. Please look up "The Project for a New American Century" see who was in that group, then check who was in W.'s government. IT IS SICKENING!!! I empathize for the poor people in Moore, but there is a worse disaster to be dealt with. It is the neocon scourge on this nation. Caused the ruination of more lives on earth than the second worst. Hitler Nazis. The W. Turd Museum must be eliminated as anything resembling an iconic symbol or structure. Just like the rebel flag, wherever flown should be #$%$ on then burned.</Msg><Username>the_verk_knows</Username><Timestamp>1369189158319</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 22:19:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369189311622-229</Id><Title>OBAMA'S APPLE CEO CRONY AVOIDED PAYING $44 BILLION IN TAXES WHILE OBAMA IRS PITBULLS AUDIT TEA PARTY REPUBLICANS</Title><Msg>Obama's apple ceo crony avoided paying $44 billion in taxes while obama irs pitbulls audit tea party republicans who are on obama's enemy list.</Msg><Username>giggling_democrat_hyeena</Username><Timestamp>1369189311622</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 22:21:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369189496009-230</Id><Title>OBAMA'S BILLIONAIRE DEMOCRAT CRONY WARREN BUFFET OWES $1 BILLION IN BACK TAXES IRS REFUSES TO GO AFTER WARREN BUFFET TO COLLECT TAXES OWED</Title><Msg>Obama's billionaire democrat crony warren buffet owes $1 billion in back taxes irs refuses to go after warren buffet to collect taxes owed but obama's irs agressively targets everyone on obama's republican enemy list.</Msg><Username>citizens_against_toxic_waste</Username><Timestamp>1369189496009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 22:24:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369189816961-231</Id><Topic><Title>Sergeant Schultz in the white house</Title><Username>hairyroid</Username><Timestamp>1369185797848</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 21:23:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jay Carney never had any credibility to lose.</Msg><Username>sean_penn_sucks</Username><Timestamp>1369189816961</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 22:30:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369190372866-232</Id><Topic><Title>Sergeant Schultz in the white house</Title><Username>hairyroid</Username><Timestamp>1369185797848</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 21:23:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only a braindead #$%$ would cling to every falsehood spewed by Jay Carney???
