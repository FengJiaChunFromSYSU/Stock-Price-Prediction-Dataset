"We know that Pakistan has arrested the doctor who helped us catch Obama-uh-bin Laden," Schieffer said, seeming to realize his mistake immediately." Except I think it was a Freudian slip, he really wanted to say because he believes the dead terrorist and the living one are joined at the hip, separated at birth pieces of shyt.

We will see more changes, 450,000 of the Dems favorite voters the dead vote have been removed from Ohio voting rolls. In a remarkable reversal of fortune for President Obama in Ohio, the GOP has closed the huge gap in absentee ballot requests used by early voters that favored the Democrats and the president in 2008, setting up what one state analyst said could be a Mitt Romney blowout on Election Day. While in 2008, 33 percent of the 1,158,301 absentee ballots went to Democrats and just 19 percent to registered Republicans, a 14-point gap, this year 29 percent are being requested by Democrats and 24 percent by Republicans, a five-point gap. And in a sign that the enthusiasm of 2008 voters is depressed, just 638,997 absentee ballots have been requested, according to American Majority Action, which culled the statistics together from Ohio college professors who are tracking the state's absentee ballots used for early voting. The group provided Secrets with the details. Even more dramatic, while the GOP has cut the Democratic advantage in early voting throughout the state, the changes favoring the Republicans in certain counties has been huge. In Franklin County, home to Columbus, for example, a 2008 Democratic advantage of 5 percent is now a 5 percent GOP advantage. In Cuyahoga County, home to Democratic Cleveland, the GOP has shaved six points off the Democrat's 2008 advantage. And in Hamilton County, home to Cincinnati, Republicans have expanded their 2008 advantage to 13 percent. University of Dayton Professor Larry Schweikart told American Majority Action President Ned Ryun that the GOP gains favor Romney. "Although it is early, we will soon be at a point where--assuming Republicans vote for Romney--the Democrats will have to overwhelmingly win all the remaining early voting just to be even on November 6. But, given Ohio's voting history, if the numbers are even close after early voting, Obama will lose, and possibly lose big." Ryun, whose group has opened voter registration efforts in Ohio and other swing states, said that the Buckeye State's efforts to clean up voter rolls has also played a part in tightening the gap. He said that 450,000 dead voters and duplicate registrations have been nixed, and the majority were Democrats. "Considering Obama won the state by 263,000 votes, Ohio's cleaner rolls could make a big impact," Ryun said. He added, "The five largest counties in Ohio have all shifted at least 6 percent and as much as 27 percent to the Republicans since 2008. While the polls show an Obama lead, these real votes--assuming registered voters vote for their candidate--demonstrate a Republican shift since 2008." Ryun sent this to Secrets from his analysis of Ohio early voting: In 2008, there were 1,158,301 total absentee ballots requested, 33 percent registered Democrat and 19 percent registered Republican--a 14 point gap. So far in 2012, 638,997 ballots have been requested, 29 percent Democrat and 24 percent Republican--only a five point gap. The Republicans have shrunk the gap nine percent overall since 2008, but when we examine key counties in Ohio, the numbers become even more dramatic. --Champaign County: Was +3% GOP, now +23% GOP - 20 point shift. --Columbiana County: Was +9% DEM, now +9% GOP - 18 point shift. --Crawford County: Was +3% DEM, now +12% GOP - 15 point shift. --Cuyahoga County: Was +36% DEM, now +30% DEM (GOP already has 6,000 more requests than in 2008) - 6 point shift. --Erie County: Was +24% DEM, now +7% DEM -17 point shift. --Franklin County: Was +5% DEM, now +5% GOP - 10 point shift. --Greene County: Was +4% DEM, now +19% GOP - 23 point shift. --Harrison County: Was +22% DEM, now +5% DEM - 17 point shift. --Hamilton County: Was +7% GOP, now +13% GOP - 6 point shift. --Licking County: Was TIED, now +16% GOP - 16 point shift. --Montgomery County: Was +29% DEM, now +5% DEM - 24 point shift. --Muskingum County: Was +1% DEM, now +16% GOP - 17 point shift. --Pickaway County: Was +12% DEM, now +15% GOP - 27 point shift. --Seneca County: Was +1% DEM, now +13% GOP - 14 point shift. --Summit County: Was +33% DEM, now +6 DEM - 27 point shift. --Wood County: Was +10% DEM, now +1% GOP - 11 point shift.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351058875439</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 02:07:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351059040231-4</Id><Topic><Title>SENILE LIB MODERATOR SCHIEFFER REFERS TO "OBAMA BIN LADEN" IN THE DEBATE</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1351051231660</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 00:00:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>internal and external threats to this country, its hard to tell them apart.

Particularly revenue from per unit licensees continued to erode because handset vendors in Japan, along with RIM, and HTC continued to lose market share to Samsung and Apple. Samsung and Apple are both fixed-term licensees where revenue streams are unaffected by volumes. OUTLOOK SHOULD BE SOLID We believe that due to the timing of asset sales, as well as license renewals and outcomes of litigation, that quarterly results are difficult to forecast. However, we should continue to see an annualized trend towards growth through licensing, partnerships, and asset sales. This is reflected in our sum-of-the-parts analysis below. Our estimate of cash includes our estimate incremental cash that resulted from the sale of the patents to Intel. We reiterate our BUY recommendation and our 12-month share price target of $45.00. Our estimate excludes licensing revenue from Nokia, Huawei, ZTE, and LG, which are all involved in litigation with Interdigital currently.

Yahoo News—Mitt Romney isn't a rock star, but on Tuesday night, he was treated like one. The Republican presidential nominee attracted nearly 12,000 people—easily one of his biggest crowds ever—at a rally held at one of the most famous concert venues in the country: the Red Rocks Amphitheater built into the Rocky Mountains outside Denver. The historic open-air venue has hosted some of the more memorable performances in the annals of rock and roll, including a 1983 concert that marked the first time many Americans had heard of a then little-known Irish band called U2. While Romney did not arrive on stage with the flash and showmanship of Bono, the GOP nominee, who was introduced by his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, elicited a reaction from the crowd that could have rivaled those received by any modern day pop star.

John Cornyn, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement Wednesday. “To try and construe his words as anything other than a restatement of that belief is irresponsible and ridiculous. In fact, rather than condemning him for his position, as some in his party have when it’s come to Republicans, I commend Congressman Donnelly for his support of life.” The NRSC’s decision to stand by Mourdock contrasts with its initial decision to drop support for Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin after he said pregnancies couldn’t result from “legitimate rape.” The NRSC later indicated it was reconsidering that position.

Back in June 2009, the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) released a detailed 188-page report, "Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States," showing how climate change would affect different regions of the country. The USGCRP is at work on its next assessment right now, which is due out in 2013. But this week a climate-change-denying think tank is trying to muddy the water by releasing what it calls an "addendum" to the USGCRP report. The Cato Institute, a "free-market" minded think-tank based in DC, plans to release its own "Addendum: Global Climate Change Impacts in the United States" report. In addition to the title, the report's cover looks like the USGCRP report: The Daily Climate The Daily Climate flagged the fake report on Monday, noting that the addendum "matches the layout and design of the original, published by the U.S. Global Change Research Program: Cover art, 'key message' sections, table of contents are all virtually identical, down to the chapter heads, fonts and footnotes." While the real USGCRP report had grim predictions for many regions of the US, the Cato report claims that "observed impacts of climate change have little national significance." A draft version of the Cato report is posted online. It lists noted climate contrarian and Cato senior fellow Pat Michaels as the editor in chief. Rick Piltz, who was a senior associate with the USGCRP for ten years before leaving amid Bush-era censorship in 2005, also covered the Cato draft on his blog, Climate Science Watch: Because of its misleading design and layout throughout, the Cato report can be characterized as a counterfeit, having nothing to do with the USGCRP or the authors of the original report. It was not subjected to the extensive review process that characterized the 2009 report, and its key findings are neither consistent with the original assessment nor with the analysis developed by the great majority of qualified scientists. UPDATE: Eleven members of the Federal Advisory Committee that wrote the 2009 USGCRP report have released a statement condemning the Cato report as "deceptive and misleading."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351102280789</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 14:11:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351103391695-139</Id><Title>obama time to let america know who you are</Title><Msg>don trumps him. should be funny to watch him squirm. come on obama what are you hiding?</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1351103391695</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 14:29:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351103396837-140</Id><Topic><Title>Ooooooh, look what the climate deniers are doing</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351102280789</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 14:11:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The entire climate boondoggle is both misleading, deceptive and malevolently manipulative....entirely for the purpose of increasing control of one group of 'elitist's at the expense of another...all the rest of us!!! #$%$, CLIMATE NUTS!!

He gets his big bonuses and MILLIONS in compensation, shareholders get the shaft. It's as if last earnings beat and guidance raise doesn't mean a thing. It baffles me how the larger shareholders continue to let Chambers get away with the options SCAM that continues to hamper and provider overhang for price appreciation. FYI, tons of shares (options)were SOLD by insiders at or above $19 a couple weeks ago. Looks like the insiders ONCE AGAIN have put it to the shareholders.

He will inherit the leadership of a party with commitments to (1) further increasing tax cuts -- especially for the wealthy; (2) reducing deficits; (3) shrinking the size of government; (4) increasing defense spending; and (5) promoting a muscular foreign policy unafraid to use military force to solve foreign-policy problems, for example, in Iran and Syria. At the same time, Romney has promised to "save" popular middle-class entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, and to replace Obamacare with reforms that keep its most popular elements but jettison the features that make it economically practical. To top it off, he faces a reckoning in January 2013, when the Bush tax cuts expire and a sequester of defense and social programs goes into effect. That combination of tax increases and spending cuts will help solve the deficit problem, but it risks pushing the economy into a new recession, and it is completely unacceptable to the tax cutters and defense hawks in his party. Even in the best-case scenario, a Romney presidency will face two major challenges: factionalism and war. It is very difficult to see how Romney can maintain all of the commitments he has made to the various factions of his party, no matter what he says on the campaign trail. For example, passing the Ryan budget, further reducing tax rates, and repealing Obamacare will exacerbate the deficit problem, not help to solve it. Romney will have to pick and choose among these commitments, and in choosing, he will likely alienate significant segments of his coalition. Moreover, he will face insistent pressures from defense hawks and neo-conservatives in his party to keep the war in Afghanistan going and to use American military force against other targets. (Iran is the most obvious possibility.) The more aggressive his foreign policy, however, the more it is likely to cost, and the more it will increase federal deficits. George W. Bush faced a similar problem in his first term, and simply arranged with Republicans in Congress to fund his military adventures through supplemental appropriations -- abandoning any pretense of deficit reduction.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351110469085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 16:27:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351110686647-172</Id><Topic><Title>Affirmative Action Obama won't take Trump's deal, he can't</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351108758600</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 15:59:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he applied to Harvard as a foreign student.

Republican Richard Mourdock, the state treasurer, and his Democratic opponent, Congressman Joe Donnelly, are wooing not just independent voters but disaffected and angry "Lugar Republicans." "Dick Lugar is a statesman," said Karl Stein, 63, a Republican, as he was walking the dog near Indianapolis. "I don't like the way he was thrown under the bus after all he's done for Indiana." Republicans need a net gain of four seats to win a Senate majority, or three if Republican Mitt Romney wins the White House because his vice president would cast tie-breaking Senate votes. Republicans began 2012 in a strong position, with Democrats defending 23 of 33 seats up for election, but have suffered some self-inflicted wounds.</Msg><Username>comsensea</Username><Timestamp>1351116535569</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 18:08:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351117354603-202</Id><Topic><Title>Obumbles LIED so many times last night, fact checkers couldn't keep up.</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1351044703106</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-23 22:11:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You know a lot about alternate reality, don't you bigpop/scott?

Oct 24, 2012 2:37 PM Women Democrat Voters and Others are Switching to Mitt Romney in Ohio Michigan Florida Virginia Pennsylvania Wisconsin New York- New Jersey ( East Coast to West Coast ) The Democrat Ladies for Romney in all 50 States Ladies are Switching from Obama very Fast. Read this and you too will Change and become a "Romney Democrat" for a Stronger USA Economy and honest leadership. Women, Jewish Democrats and others are Switching to Mitt Romney for President. Women Review Debate 3 : First, Governor Mitt Romney Pasted the President Test, Ready to Lead USA. By USA_Jewish_Women 10 22 2012 Great Impression: Mitt Romney's Stunning Turnaround in Past 3 Debates after Huge Negative Ads. The Reasons for Change is Obama has Lost the Support and Respect with Women Voters and Others. People Notice: Most Men and Women are Turned Off Against Barack Obama most everywhere and Across All 50 States, Here is the the Review of Debate 3 on October 22, 2012 By a Jewish Women Focus Group of 7,890 Women Connecticut Across America Our Strong Plea for Change in the White House, Why? The following reasons listed bellow. Note: This review is a agreement amongst a Group of almost 8000 Women watching debates. During the Debate 3, President Barack Obama was Arrogant, Disrespectfully, Angry, Rude and Condescending to Governor Mitt Romney. Obama did not Act or Look Presidential. We Feel Governor Mitt Romney Pasted the Presidential Test and is Ready to Lead USA We Support Mitt Romney, found him to be a Smart, Respectable and Decent Gentleman. Governor Mitt Romney Looked Much More Presidential, Ready to be Commander-in-Chief. Mitt Romney said America Needs a Strong Economy in order to have a Strong Military for our National Security right now and the Future. ...... We All Agree. Women came away from this Debate with a Very Good Impression of Governor Mitt Romney, in that he would be a “ A Safe Pair of Hands.” in Foreign Policy and a Strong Economy. We Trust Him More. Obama lied about Libya on 9 11 ( a 8 hour fire fight, Obama watched did nothing) In Foreign Policy We feel Mitt Romney is Tough Enough to do what’s necessary, but laid-back enough not to do too much and get us into another war. Miit Romney Did Not attack President Obama's Policies, he Simply Pointed Out a Few Needed Improvements in a Very Respectable Way. During the debate Governor Mitt Romney Seemed More Like a Leader, Smart, Respectable, Thoughtful and Considerate. He looked and Acted more Like the New American President that our Nation and the rest of the World Needs so Disparately in These Troubling Economic Times. Governor Mitt Romney was Calm, Thoughtful, Relaxed, Steady, Looked Like A Smart Gentleman and More Presidential. Romney Looked and Acted as if he was Ready to Take the Job as Commander-in-Chief ASAP. President Barack Obama Looked more like a Very Disparate Candidate and Challenger, very Negative, Acted like a Disrespectful Attack Dog Instead of the President of the United States. Mitt Romney Expressed his Concern about Iran's Nuclear Threat that is 4 Years Closer and the USA Support of Israel, our Good Friend and Middle East Ally. The strained relationship with the Obama Administration. Tonight Romney Impressed the Ladies Very much, in that a Vote for Him is a Vote for American Security, Peace and Safety, a Strong Economy, a Strong Military, Millions of Higher Paying Jobs, Prosperity for the Middle Class and Others. and a Quiet Peaceful Life for USA and all People. The World is Much to Scary these days, Americans Aren’t Looking For a Scary Arrogant, Angry. Rude, Disrespectfully and Weak President. Barack Obama is Not the One to Lead us Any Longer Tonight we Came Away with the Feeling that President Barack Obama is extremely a more Scary Candidate then the President of USA. We are Concerned about America's Weaken Relationship with Israel, a Nuclear Iran, our Weaken Economy and the Huge 16 Trillion Dollars Debt, that in itself Threatens our National Security. Americans, Black, White, Latinos, Wake Up, USA Debt is Bigger than our Gross National Product. We Can Not Afford Four More Years of President Obama's Spending, Borrowing and lies. We Can Not Afford Another 5 or 6 Trillion Dollars in More Debt From China or Other Countries. Our Jewish Women's Focus Group of almost 8000 Democrats Therefore Proudly Endorse Governor Mitt Romney as the Next President of the United States of America. Vote for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan Before It's to Late. Do it Now ....ASAP Public Notice: We Feel Strongly that President Barack Obama is No Longer Fit to Lead USA.</Msg><Username>political_gangsters</Username><Timestamp>1351118642759</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 18:44:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351119081778-206</Id><Topic><Title>Staples Founder Ex-Wife Won’t Block Unsealing Romney TestimonyQ</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1351116763154</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 18:12:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Silver Nail for RomneyCoffin</Msg><Username>ambientbpl</Username><Timestamp>1351119081778</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 18:51:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351119336621-207</Id><Title>WOW!

When that happens, Trump will conduct his own document dump, likely to include Zero’s college records (with claims that he was foreign born, for scholarship purposes), his passport records and the divorce papers that Moochelle served on him back in 2000. The Dims are used to Republicans that don’t fight back. Just as we’ve learned about contact between Allred and Obama, there was likely back channel coordination between Trump and the Romney camp. Allred will play the divorce records card (tactic #1 in the Obama playbook) and Trump will go nuclear. It’s that simple.

Now McCorvey, the ‘Roe’ in the Roe v. Wade case, has released an ad urging voters not to vote for Obama. McCorvey became a Christian in 1995 and has since repudiated her role in Roe v. Wade, campaigning for its reversal In her ad, McCorvey says the Roe v. Wade decision was based upon a “lie” and urges citizens to vote against Obama. The transcript: “I’m Norma McCorvey, the former Jane Roe of the Roe vs. Wade decision that brought ‘legal’ child killing to America. “I was persuaded by feminist attorneys to lie; to say that I was raped, and needed an abortion. It was all a lie. “Since then, over 50 million babies have been murdered. I will take this burden to my grave. “Please, don’t follow in my mistakes. DO NOT vote for Barack Obama. He murders babies.” The ad concludes with Randall Terry saying: “I approve this message.” The commercial also contains graphic abortion images. President Obama has consistently voted in favor of abortion, earning him the label of “most pro-abortion president” in U.S. history by pro-life groups across the country. Pro-life activists have especially highlighted his support for partial birth abortion – a procedure in which a baby is killed while only his head remains in his mother’s body – and his repeated votes against an Illinois bill that would have protected babies born alive after failed abortions from being killed. “Norma McCorvey is a burr in the saddle of the baby killers; and she may help throw Obama out of the saddle,” said Terry in a statement about the ad. “This ad could help bring down Obama in the closing days of this campaign - please God - make it so.”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351137415366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 23:56:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
