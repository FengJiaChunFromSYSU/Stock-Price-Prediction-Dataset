FINALLY, something REASONABLE out of MITT, Romney says he won’t cut taxes on wealthy Americans Mitt Romney rejected claims by President Barack Obama that he would sign off on more tax breaks for the wealthy if elected president, but again declined to offer specifics on how exactly he would accomplish his goal of lowering taxes for other Americans while also balancing the budget. In an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press," Romney said he would offset his proposed 20 percent tax cut for all Americans by eliminating loopholes and deductions for high-income earners. He argued that his plan would in effect lower taxes for middle class Americans while keeping tax rates the same for wealthy Americans. "People at the high end, high income taxpayers, are going to have fewer deductions and exemptions. Those numbers are going to come down. Otherwise they'd get a tax break," Romney told NBC. "And I want to make sure people understand, despite what the Democrats said at their convention, I am not reducing taxes on high income taxpayers." Romney argued that limiting deductions and exceptions would keep government revenues up and "encourage more hiring" and "encourage growth" in the economy. He said he wants to "makes sure we don't put any bigger burden on middle income people." But asked about "the specifics of how you get into this math," Romney declined to offer any additional details, suggesting the "principals" of his plan should be enough for Americans to judge his tax proposals. THE FACT THAT HE REFUSED to GET INTO SPECIFICS means he CAN NOT LEVEL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! "The specifics are these which is those principles I described are the heart of my policy," Romney said. "And I've indicated as well that contrary to what the Democrats are saying I'm not going to increase the tax burden on middle-income families. It would absolutely be wrong to do that."</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo6</Username><Timestamp>1347276198030</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 07:23:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347278319087-3</Id><Topic><Title>WHERE ARE WILLARDS TAXES.

Lee Fang reports in The Nation that Ryan wrote a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services on December 10, 2010, recommending a grant to build a new facility in his district. As Fang points out, “The grant Ryan requested was funded directly by the Affordable Care Act, better known simply as healthcare reform or Obamacare.” Ryan’s letter can be seen here. While trying to build a community health clinic shouldn’t be controversial, it is when the request comes from Rep. Ryan. Over the past three years, Ryan has been one of the most vocal opponents of the law that he calls an abomination. Yet it didn’t stop him from requesting “job killing,” “budget busting” funds for his district. Apparently, while Ryan thinks that health care rights “come from nature and God,” he acknowledges that money for his district comes from the government. This isn’t the first time that Ryan has been caught using a government program that he derides; in August, it was revealed that Ryan had requested stimulus money while simultaneously claiming that “I’m not one who votes for something and then writes to the government to ask them to send us money.” As Bill Clinton said last night: “it takes some brass” to be Paul Ryan.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo9</Username><Timestamp>1347280752124</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 08:39:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347281170711-8</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA GOT NO BOUNCE IN POLLS FROM CON VENTION</Title><Username>demrectums</Username><Timestamp>1347239501177</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 21:11:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL The world is flat!!!

Both had found a roughly even race on interviews conducted in the month of August before the conventions, and both now show Obama leading Republican nominee Mitt Romney by similar margins (5 and 4 percentage points, respectively). The latest Gallup Daily interviews spanned the full week, from September 2 to 8, with roughly half coming before the speeches by Presidents Clinton and Obama on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Rasmussen's recent interviews were conducted September 6 to 8, so two-thirds of their respondents were called after Obama's speech.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347282082840</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 09:01:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347282083806-12</Id><Topic><Title>why we are so much better off</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347280262662</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 08:31:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK FINE I agree with you, we should judge a President on a finite period.

The AARA wasn't even signed until mid Feb (remember the one no GOP congressmen voted for and only 3 GOP Senators supported, the one the CBO says saved 4 million jobs).

Guess who was a Senator in the congress........Ding ding ding....you guessed it, YOUR Messiah. Where were his great ideas at the time......ding ding ding.......There were NONE. Obama has the WORST recovery since the great depression. He has had plenty of time for his policies to take hold. He has had 3 1/2 years to turn it around and there are STILL less Americans working today than when he took office. Worker participation rate is the worst it has been in 31 YEARS. FACTS, Dumb Dumb, FACTS. Blaming everyone else for O'Losers failures is an OLD and tired argument. Nobody cares anymore about you people and your incessant whining and blaming.

John Aravosis: The man believes in nothing. Sunday morning on NBC, Mitt Romney said that while he wants to repeal Health Care Reform, he would leave the provisions in place that ban insurers from discriminating based on pre-existing conditions, and that require insurance companies to cover children up to the age of 26 on their parents' plans. Hooray! A moment of humanity from the ice princess! Not so fast. As soon as Mitt's conservative overlords got wind of it, Romney did a quick 180, and now is against helping people with pre-existing conditions, and with children aged 26 and under. Let me be more precise. Mitt Romney is now saying that if he's elected president he will take away health care from 6.6 million children that are now on their parents' health insurance plans, and he will once again let insurance companies turn away people with "pre-existing conditions" as benign as psoriasis, high cholesterol and asthma. In reference to how Romney would deal with those with preexisting conditions and young adults who want to remain on their parents’ plans, a Romney aide responded that there had been no change in Romney’s position and that “in a competitive environment, the marketplace will make available plans that include coverage for what there is demand for. He was not proposing a federal mandate to require insurance plans to offer those particular features.” Then, suddenly, last night the Romney campaign amended their amended statement in an effort to suggest that they would in fact preserve the non-discrimination language concerning pre-existing conditions. Hurray! But not so fast, a re-read of the new statement makes clear that in fact Romney won't be preserving the pre-existing conditions protections that are in Health Care Reform. Romney simply wanted you to think he was going to preserve it, but he really isn't. So now he's not simply spineless, he's also duplicitous. When you're worth a minimum of a quarter of a billion dollars it's of little consequence to you that more than six million children will lose their health insurance because of your incessant pandering to the far right. But just as serious, this is all the more evidence that Mitt Romney simply believes in nothing. He will be whatever the highest bidder wants him to be. And that doesn't bode well for the rest of us not worth a quarter of a billion dollars!!!!</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1347295700617</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 12:48:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347295736631-34</Id><Topic><Title>"If Obama were not black, would you have voted for him?"</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1347237019573</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 20:30:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are a Racist if you vote for Mitt because he is white because you won" vote for a black person.

His prime example is the American Jobs Act that the president unveiled at a joint session of Congress on Sept. 8, 2011. Thanks to GOP obstructionism, the bill was dead on arrival. Krugman cites a report from the consulting firm Macroeconomic Advisers that estimates the legislation would have added 1.3 million jobs by the end of this year, had it been enacted. That the bill went nowhere has given Republicans a cleverly cynical argument against Obama. “And now, having prevented Mr. Obama from implementing any of his policies, those same Republicans are pointing to disappointing job numbers and declaring that the president’s policies have failed,” Krugman argues. “Think of it as a two-part strategy. First, obstruct any and all efforts to strengthen the economy, then exploit the economy’s weakness for political gain.” That exploitation might make for great politics, but it’s hurting people. At a time when people are clamoring for work or have given up looking altogether, what Republicans have done and are doing is unconscionable. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) talked about the divisions in Congress when he met with Post writers and editors last week in Charlotte. But when he was asked if the Republicans today weren’t employing the same tactics used by the Democrats during President George W. Bush’s tenure, Hoyer provided a history lesson from when he was House majority leader that should not go unheeded. A Republican president, a Republican secretary of [the treasury] and a Republican-appointed head of the Federal Reserve on Sept. 18, an election year, partisan year, came to the Congress of the United States, led by [then-Speaker of the House] Nancy Pelosi and [Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid, and said, “Our country is in deep trouble and if you don’t act we’re going to to into a depression.” Nancy Pelosi; Harry Reid; Steny Hoyer, majority leader; Dick Durbin, majority whip: What did we do? We said, “Mr. President, we’re going to stand with you. We’re going to get the votes.” We cast the most difficult vote arguably any member of Congress has cast on the bailout, in a bipartisan fashion. What did the Republicans do? They walked away from their country. And they walked away from their president, as they walked away so many times.... Because Republicans had it in for Obama before Day 1, they are complicit in the failures they rail against. Would that the GOP cared enough to put the country and Americans ahead of politics and their electoral fortunes.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347305888586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:38:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347306008943-80</Id><Topic><Title>if only the GOP would put country ahead of party</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347305888586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:38:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Krugman is a far left loon who borders on being a commie.Therefore, you love him,Magoo.</Msg><Username>crankf41</Username><Timestamp>1347306008943</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:40:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347306528560-81</Id><Title>If only libTURDS and O'Loser would put country first</Title><Msg>Instead of their political future. 100 plus rounds of golf, endless vacations, 2 years of campaigning......How can you find time to govern?

Will there be some accounting of how many of those kids show up to get the food? Wouldn't it be true that if you were truly hungry, you'd go to school to get food.

This is really good for America, when Obama gets a giant mandate the GOP will come to the table and we will finally have a government run to fix our problems and not one where the GOP is trying to destroy the economy thinking it will get them elected. MANSFIELD, Ohio -- Is Mitt Romney campaigning hard enough? The question came up Monday during a news conference with senior Romney campaign advisor Kevin Madden, who found himself in the unusual position of defending the Republican presidential nominee's work ethic. “The governor's been campaigning very vigorously and we're going to continue to campaign very vigorously,” Madden told reporters after a Romney speech at a machine tool plant in central Ohio. “We don't look at many days where we're not very busy getting our message out.” The questions may reflect a sense that some conservatives are growing restive about the state of the campaign. Tracking polls have shown President Obama widening a lead, albeit a narrow one, over Romney in the aftermath of Democratic and Republican national conventions. It isn't clear whether that advantage will last, but the conventional wisdom holds that Romney didn't come out of the conventions with the wind at his back. Romney took the day off from campaigning Sunday, following his usual protocol, and had just the one public event on Monday, the speech in Mansfield. Afterward, he flew to Chicago, where he attended a fundraiser at a private home in suburban Lake Forest. He has just one public event scheduled Tuesday, in Reno. Like Ohio, Nevada is a battleground state where polls have shown Obama leading.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347323207027</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 20:26:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347323231330-112</Id><Topic><Title>Good for Ron Paul</Title><Username>crankf41</Username><Timestamp>1347320308728</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 19:38:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oopsie on me.Shoulda said Rand Paul, not his daddy.lol</Msg><Username>crankf41</Username><Timestamp>1347323231330</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 20:27:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347323431586-113</Id><Title>The rich C-riminals with SWISS BANK ACCOUNTS ans businesses in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands have outsourced our jobs and now would like to know if we are better off today than 4 years ago.
