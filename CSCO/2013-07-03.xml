The decade through 2010 was the warmest for both hemispheres and for land and sea, the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said Wednesday in an e-mailed report examining climate trends for the beginning of the millennium. Almost 94 per cent of countries logged their warmest 10 years on record, it said. “The decadal rate of increase between 1991-2000 and 2001-2010 was unprecedented,” WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said in a statement. “Rising concentrations of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are changing our climate, with far-reaching implications for our environment and our oceans.” The report underlines the challenge the globe faces in containing temperature gains since industrialisation to the 2-degree Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) ceiling set by UN climate-treaty negotiators. The planet is on course to warm by 4 degrees by 2100 because emissions are still rising, the World Bank says.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372857118401</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:11:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372857736244-27</Id><Topic><Title>meanwhile in the real world where global warming exists</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372856806958</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Meanwhile, the libs talk about solutions that kill jobs?

Their overwhelming negative status in the world has now confined them to personal prisons where they can no longer travel abroad for public events. It appears they're only welcome in heavily-secured private dragon lairs for the rest of their waking years. But even those locations are shrinking for these torturers and mass murderers. Cheney, scheduled to speak in Toronto with his daughter next month, had to cancel the speaking appearance due to "security concerns stemming from their experiences in Vancouver in September 2011," according to a press release about the event. The September event referred to in the press release was hardly a public event at all. It cost $500 a ticket to attend and took place at the Vancouver Club which the Canadian Press called "one of Vancouver's most exclusive clubs." Still, the public caught wind of the event and staged a rambunctious protest calling for Cheney's arrest. The angry crowd caused Cheney to be locked in the club for seven hours longer than he was scheduled. In February of last year, George W. Bush had to cancel a speaking engagement in Switzerland because human rights groups put pressure on the Swiss government to arrest him over torture allegations if he enters the country. Even though officials claimed Bush had diplomatic immunity because he was a former head of state, they recognized that torture is a legitimate crime under international law. Organizers of the event felt the "atmosphere had become too threatening" and the gala went on without Bush.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372858781684</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:39:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372858814331-35</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo, this is a Cisco Message Board!</Title><Username>woodrocks5125</Username><Timestamp>1372828745815</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 01:19:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>woodstick you pinhead! time for you to leave the room! this is a political discussion board!</Msg><Username>dems_are_weakings</Username><Timestamp>1372858814331</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:40:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372859500680-36</Id><Topic><Title>Moron stepped on it again</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1372857903726</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:25:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A little private lefty group in Malaysia called Bush a war criminal and you fell for it.

Prosecutors also are seeking to introduce a job application Zimmerman made to a police agency in Virginia in 2009 and an application to ride around with Sanford police officers in 2010.

Just the facts. Remember where you were when you heard the news. The first conviction for war crimes against George W. Bush, #$%$ Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and several of their senior legal advisors has been made. A U.S. President has been convicted for war crimes, and it's the initial collection round the ICC probably needed towards raising Bush’s airfare to The Hague. The prosecution occurred at the Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Tribunal Foundation, a private organization chartered under Malaysian law. It is very significant because it has been created by those with power to persuade the ICC. Those condemned are Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and former deputy assistant attorney general John Choon Yoo, former assistant attorney general Jay Bybee, and former counsels Alberto Gonzales, David Addington and William Haynes. The transgressions are the use of torture and the war crime of using torture during war, as defined by the Convention against Torture and four Geneva conventions of 1949, to which the United States government is a party. The statement of the tribunal was that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld “engaged in a web of instructions, memos, directives, legal advice and action that established a common plan and purpose, joint enterprise and / or conspiracy to commit the crimes of Torture and War Crimes, including and not limited to a common plan and purpose to commit the following crimes in relation to the ‘War on Terror’ and the wars launched by the US and others in Afghanistan and Iraq.” The evidence that they knew about this and supported it has been very compelling for quite a while.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372860647479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:10:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372860871315-62</Id><Topic><Title>Judge allows testimony on Zimmerman's criminal justice classes!!!</Title><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1372860030607</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:00:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm allowed to argue with myself.

The real story here is how did this conviction get covered up for so many years? I spoke to a lawyer last night familiar with these kinds of cases. She said that a D.U.I., in and of itself, is not something worth covering up. Had Bush revealed this himself, he would have found the public forgiving of his infraction. No, my lawyer friend continued, the only reason to cover it up would be that there was something ELSE connected to the arrest that night -- e.g., drugs or resisting arrest. This other potential charge could have been dropped and expunged. The reporter was shown only the court docket which listed Bush's name, address, and the charge to which he pleaded guilty. What we need to see is the actual POLICE REPORT from that night. Assuming it hasn't been doctored, that will tell us the truth. The Bush people have already lied about the nature of the D.U.I. arrest (they said the cop pulled Bush over because he was "driving too slowly"; the arresting officer last night said it was because Bush had "swerved off on the shoulder of the road"). Bush himself lied last night when asked about the night he spent in jail. "I didn't spend time in jail," he insisted. The officer told the local reporter that Bush, in fact, was handcuffed, taken to the station, and held in custody for at least an hour and a half.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372865840457</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:37:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372865942106-86</Id><Topic><Title>RUSH LIMBAUGH HAS REPEATEDLY DAMAGED THE OBAMA ADMIN.</Title><Username>lameduck0bama</Username><Timestamp>1372861036013</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 10:17:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you better look up the word before you use it Ivan</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372865942106</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 11:39:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372866765455-87</Id><Title>Another tea billie released from Jail</Title><Msg>George Homer Ryan, Sr. (born February 24, 1934) was the 39th Governor of the U.S. state of Illinois from 1999 until 2003.

(AP) — A mother and father who prayed instead of seeking medical help as their daughter died in front of them were properly convicted of homicide, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Wednesday. Eleven-year-old Madeline Kara Neumann died of undiagnosed diabetes on Easter Sunday in March 2008 at home in the central Wisconsin village of Weston. Prosecutors said her parents, Dale and Leilani Neumann, ignored obvious symptoms of severe illness as Kara became too weak to speak, eat, drink or walk, choosing to pray rather than take her to a doctor. The Supreme Court's decision said the Neumanns don't belong to any organized church but believe visiting a doctor amounts to worshipping an idol rather than God. As Kara's condition worsened they resisted suggestions from her grandmother to take her to a doctor. Kara's grandfather suggested giving her Pedialyte, a supplement used to combat dehydration in children, but Leilani Neumann said that would take the glory away from God.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372867814372</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 12:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372868640326-95</Id><Title>get alerts on stocks that actually run high</Title><Msg>They never miss a beat with their picks.

While so many others sit quietly and meekly, bowing to the desires of K Street and Wall Street, Warren is determined to speak up for those of us who can't afford our own lobbyist. She's all worked up about charging students so much for education loans: As the deadline for student loan rates to double steadily approached last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was on the warpath against the nation’s largest student lender, doggedly pursuing information that would explain why Sallie Mae took cheap, taxpayer-backed loans from a federal bank and used it to fund extremely expensive, private loans to students. The clash culminated over the weekend, when The Hill learned on Sunday that she also sent a letter to Sallie Mae’s CEO that accused the bank of taking advantage of taxpayers in order to rake in “big fees” from student borrowers. “While Sallie Mae is finding unique ways to profit from government programs, its borrowers are paying interest rates that are far in excess of the low cost of funds supported by the U.S. taxpayers,” she reportedly wrote.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1372871283915</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 13:08:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372871478792-105</Id><Title>Remember when Bush was arrested for cocaine?</Title><Msg>But Hatfield quotes “a high-ranking advisor to Bush” who confirmed that Bush was arrested for cocaine possession in Houston in 1972, and had the record expunged by a judge who was “a fellow Republican and elected official” who helped Bush get off “with a little community service at a minority youth center instead of having to pick cotton on a Texas prison farm.” Hatfield quotes a former Yale classmate who told him: “George W. was arrested for possession of cocaine in 1972, but due to his father’s connections, the entire record was expunged by a state judge whom the older Bush helped get elected.

Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty to a charge of second-degree murder, saying he shot Martin in self-defense during their confrontation inside a gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford on Feb, 26, 2012. Prosecutors say Zimmerman's choice of classes at Seminole State College, on criminal investigation and witness testimony among other topics, underscored his intense interest in law enforcement and previous interest in becoming a police officer. One of the first witnesses called by the prosecution after the judge's ruling, Army Captain Alexis Carter, was a teacher of Zimmerman in a 2010 college class on criminal litigation. In an interview with Fox News last year, Zimmerman said he had no knowledge of Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law before he shot Martin. The television interview was replayed on Tuesday for the jury that will decide Zimmerman's fate. But Carter, an army lawyer, said he often covered Florida's self-defense and "Stand Your Ground" laws in his 2010 course and they were a frequent topic of classroom discussion. Carter said Zimmerman "was probably one of the better students in the class" calling him an "A" student.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1372872441503</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 13:27:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372872753619-107</Id><Title>Discretionary freedom reduced 5.1%</Title><Msg>FEWER EXPLOSIONS BAD - Amanda Terkel: "Expect fewer patriotic displays this July 4, thanks to federal budget cuts.

Camp Lejeune in North Carolina is one of the bases that won't have fireworks this year. The commanding general, Brig. Gen.
