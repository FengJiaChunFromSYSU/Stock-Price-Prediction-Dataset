"If all you do is try to find a police or military solution to the problem, a lot of people die and it doesn't solve the problem," Clinton says in “Breaking the Taboo,” which debuts Friday. "It hasn't worked." “Taboo” chronicles 40 years of the nation’s battle against drugs, according to U.S. News &amp; World Report. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, it praises Clinton and others who "have had the guts to change their minds." Drug budgets, marijuana arrests and the numbers of those sent to prison on drug charges increased during the Clinton White House, U.S. News reports. The documentary contends that President Barack Obama's drug policies aren't working, despite a request for $25.6 billion for drug control in 2013, the highest annual amount ever. But too much of those funds is going toward enforcement, critics say, even though the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy says most is intended for prevention and treatment. For his part, Carter says in the documentary that current penalties against drug offenders are a major issue. "Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself," Carter writes on the film's website. The documentary is produced by Spray Films and Sundog Pictures.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354970500410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 07:41:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354971139782-13</Id><Topic><Title>It's not working</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354970500410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 07:41:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"War on drugs" another brilliant Republican idea that not only doesn't work,but cost America hundreds of Millions in tax money.Don't think these rightwing lawmakers ever had a good idea.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1354971139782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 07:52:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354971351348-14</Id><Topic><Title>2 days total fed expenses, is all the taxes on the rich will pay for</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1354908286282</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:24:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You got to hand it to Obama, nobody can make bigger lies about small change.

It shows that you must be less than 30. Back in the 70's, rape was claimed by many young women, so they could claim a welfare check. When they eventually called in the police, they usually found out that the sex was consensual. I think the welfare department ignored it for a long, long time, and just handed out checks. That's probably what the old man meant when he was speaking of "legitimate rape." Instead of laughing at comments you think are silly, you should try using your brain and figuring out why someone might have said them.

In a head-to-head contest, a March 26 McClatchy-Marist Poll shows Romney ahead of Obama 47-42 among those without college degrees, while Obama leads Romney 51-42 among those with them. Similarly, those without college degrees lean toward voting for Republican congressional candidates 49-40, while those with them lean toward Democrats 46-44. Not only are Democrats making gains among the better-educated, but these voters are becoming a larger share of the electorate. Exit polls show the growth of the college-educated voting bloc. In 1984, those with college and advanced degrees made up 35.3 percent of the electorate. Reagan’s strongest margins were among the college educated, who backed him over Walter F. Mondale by a crushing 62.7-36.9 margin. Among all those with both college and advanced degrees, Reagan won 58.7 percent, a landslide margin. Jump to 2008. Even though those with college degrees made up 27.9 percent of the population that year, they cast 45 percent of the presidential vote. These voters register and go to the polls in substantially higher numbers than the less well educated. By 2008, the Republican advantage of the early 1980s among voters with a college degree or higher had disappeared. Barack Obama carried this demographic with 54.1 percent. He beat McCain 50-48 among those with bachelor’s degrees, and by a decisive 58-40 among the 17 percent of the 2008 electorate with post-graduate degrees.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354987181908</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 12:19:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354987317692-60</Id><Topic><Title>numbers LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354986619913</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 12:10:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and more facts A staggering 68 percent of registered Republican voters stated that they believe demonic possession is real.

TWICE (with service records ALSO showing that he was accused of stealing a fellow soldier's car during his time in the Army). Later started a car alarm company... NO, SERIOUSLY... LATER STARTED A CAR ALARM COMPANY. SERIOUSLY. - Claims to have served in the Army for 9 years, but Army records only show 5 (most of which were logged during college ROTC). Received a bad conduct rating and was demoted during his time in the active military (oh yeah, and did we mention he was also accused of stealing a fellow soldier's car?), leaving the service 2 years before his tour was over. - Was investigated for arson and insurance fraud in connection with a suspicious fire at his company. Had greatly increased his fire insurance coverage just weeks before the fire, and had removed the company's computer from the premises and locked critical operational documents in a fireproof safe just days before the fire - neither of which he had ever done at any other time previously. Investigators also found that a flammable liquid had been poured in THE ONLY AREA WHICH WASN'T PROTECTED BY FIRE SPRINKLERS. - Was arrested on illegal weapons charges ... TWICE. Later, he threatened a subordinate with a handgun at his own company's offices (he somehow avoided arrest in this THIRD gun-related incident). - Claims to have worked Richard Nixon's security detail during the 1971 World Series, even though NIXON DIDN'T ATTEND EVEN A SINGLE 1971 WORLD SERIES GAME.

Yawn. The middle class can afford $2400. It's not like you are taking it from the poor. Letting the Bush tax cuts expire is a no-brainer. The only question on the table is whether Oblamer can do anything besides blame. Oblamer might try to negotiate after he is done campaigning, but I won't hold my breath.

But don’t tell that to 49 percent of Republicans, who evidently believe that the election was stolen purely on faith. Public Policy Polling provides this potentially alarming statistic in their most recent national poll: 49% of GOP voters nationally say they think that ACORN stole the election for President Obama. We found that 52% of Republicans thought that ACORN stole the 2008 election for Obama, so this is a modest decline, but perhaps smaller than might have been expected given that ACORN doesn’t exist anymore. Some GOP voters are so unhappy with the outcome that they no longer care to be a part of the United States. 25% of Republicans say they would like their state to secede from the union compared to 56% who want to stay and 19% who aren’t sure. One reason that such a high percentage of Republicans are holding what could be seen as extreme views is that their numbers are declining. Our final poll before the election, which hit the final outcome almost on the head, found 39% of voters identifying themselves as Democrats and 37% as Republicans. Since the election we’ve seen a 5 point increase in Democratic identification to 44%, and a 5 point decrease in Republican identification to 32%. One strange part about this set of facts is that ACORN, or the Association of Community Organizers for Reform Now, is an organization that ceased to exist in its original form long before the 2012 election ever existed.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354999698145</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 15:48:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355000152818-92</Id><Title>Bet dad was glad he was packing so he could keep his son safe from the bad guys</Title><Msg>MERCER, Pa. — Authorities say a 7-year-old boy was shot to death when a gun accidentally went off as his father was getting into his truck outside a western Pennsylvania gun store.

Onetime Pelham Police Chief Edward Fleury could have faced as much as 50 years in prison had he been convicted of involuntary manslaughter and three counts of furnishing machine guns to minors, reports the Associated Press. His acquittal also calls into doubt, the article says, an ongoing criminal case against two co-defendants who also brought machine guns to the event at which Christopher Bizilj accidentally shot himself in the head with a 9 mm micro Uzi when he couldn't control the gun's kickback. The boy's father, an emergency room physician, brought both the 8-year-old and an 11-year-old brother to the event and was filming Christopher when he shot himself. The father wasn't charged, said prosecutor William Bennett, because "I thought he had been punished enough."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355001890824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 16:24:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355001964055-100</Id><Topic><Title>Bet dad was glad he was packing so he could keep his son safe from the bad guys</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355000152818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 15:55:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL As if you are exempt from the culling.

C137H97O9NS Additionally: "Converting coal to a liquid fuel (CTL) – a process referred to as coal liquefaction – allows coal to be utilised as an alternative to oil. There are two different methods for converting coal into liquid fuels: Direct liquefaction works by dissolving the coal in a solvent at high temperature and pressure. This process is highly efficient, but the liquid products require further refining to achieve high grade fuel characteristics. Indirect liquefaction gasifies the coal to form a ‘syngas’ (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide). The syngas is then condensed over a catalyst – the ‘Fischer-Tropsch’ process – to produce high quality, ultra-clean products. An array of products can be made via these processes – ultra-clean petroleum and diesel, as well as synthetic waxes, lubricants, chemical feedstocks and alternative liquid fuels such as methanol and dimethyl ether (DME)."

Democrats want jobless benefits in `cliff' deal Dec 8, 10:36 AM (ET) By SAM HANANEL WASHINGTON (AP) - Hovering in the background of the "fiscal cliff" debate is the prospect of 2 million people losing their unemployment benefits four days after Christmas. "This is the real cliff," said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I. He's been leading the effort to include another extension of benefits for the long-term unemployed in any deal to avert looming tax increases and massive spending cuts in January. "Many of these people are struggling to pay mortgages, to provide education for their children," Reed said this past week as President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, rejected each other's opening offers for a deficit deal. Emergency jobless benefits for about 2.1 million people out of work more than six months will cease Dec. 29, and 1 million more will lose them over the next three months if Congress doesn't extend the assistance again. Since the collapse of the economy in 2008, the government has poured $520 billion - an amount equal to about half its annual deficit in recent years - into unemployment benefit extensions. White House officials have assured Democrats that Obama is committed to extending them another year, at a cost of about $30 billion, as part of an agreement for sidestepping the fiscal cliff and reducing the size of annual increases in the federal debt. "The White House has made it clear that it wants an extension," said Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. Republicans have been relatively quiet on the issue lately. They demanded and won savings elsewhere to offset the cost of this year's extension, requiring the government to sell some of its broadcasting airwaves and making newly hired federal workers contribute more toward their pensions. Boehner did not include jobless benefits in his counteroffer response this past week to Obama's call for $1.6 trillion in new taxes over the next decade, including raising the top marginal rates for the highest-paid 2 percent. Long-term unemployment remains a persistent problem. About 5 million people have been out of work for six months or more, according to the Bureau of labor Statistics. That's about 40 percent of all unemployed workers. The Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate fell to 7.7 percent from 7.9 percent, the lowest in nearly four years. But much of the decline was due to people so discouraged about finding a job that they quit looking for one. Democrats have tried to keep a flame burning under the issue. Ending the extended benefits would "deal a devastating blow to our economy," 42 Democratic senators wrote Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., this past week. The Congressional Budget Office said in a study last month that extending the current level of long-term unemployment benefits another year would add 300,000 jobs to the economy. The average benefit of about $300 a week tends to get spent quickly for food, rent and other basic necessities, the report said, stimulating the economy. The liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute found that extended unemployment benefits lifted 2.3 million Americans out of poverty last year, including 600,000 children.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355023837693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 22:30:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355026549137-134</Id><Topic><Title>Do the Pukes really care?</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1355023837693</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 22:30:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why should they care.
