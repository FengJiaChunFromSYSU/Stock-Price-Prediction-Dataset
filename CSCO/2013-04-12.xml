The release of proposed new national science standards, including the emphasis of manmade climate change, will alter the classroom landscape for millions of students in the United States, as well as for at least one education publisher readying for the “major” undertaking. The Next Generation Science Standards, which were released Tuesday after development by 26 states and several national scientific organizations, recommend that educators for the first time identify climate change as a core concept and stress the relationship between that change and human activity. “Human activities, such as the release of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, are major factors in the current rise in Earth’s mean surface temperature (global warming),” according to the elementary school standards, which are not federally mandated and will be adopted on a state-by-state basis.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365790337944</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 14:12:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365790447093-61</Id><Topic><Title>dead and the tea billies are against teaching science</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365790337944</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 14:12:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dead finally has capitulated that he is a bona fide loser !</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1365790447093</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 14:14:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365790696117-62</Id><Title>tea billies , LOL</Title><Msg>"At the UN, President Obama called on other countries to help us track down and eliminate radicals and extremists. But they told Obama, 'Hey, the tea party is your problem, buddy.'" –Jay Leno "These Tea Party groups are very conservative. In fact, 58 percent of Tea Party members now believe Joe Biden is a Muslim." –Jay Leno "What a day for the tea party people. Did you see that? America’s parks and fairgrounds were lost in a sea of man-boobs. They were venting their anger and rage against taxes, which, of course, in most cases for them went down. Protesting their taxes went down – but you know, why let the truth spoil a perfectly good Klan rally." –Bill Maher "Federal taxes last year when down for 98 percent of people, but when asked about this, only 12 percent of the Teabaggers thought this was the case. 88 percent of them had it wrong. And a spokesman for the Teabaggers said, 'We don’t want to just be taxed less. We want to be taxed less by a white guy." –Bill Maher "They used the opportunity on Tax Day to come up with what they call a 'Contract From America.' Remember the 'Contract With America'? Well, this is a different set of 10 completely ridiculous ideas. Like number 4, I'm not kidding about this: 'The tax code cannot have more words than the Constitution.' You know between this and the complaints about the health care bill being too long, can we say it? It's not taxes they hate, it's reading." –Bill Maher "At a Tea Party rally in Boston yesterday, Sarah Palin praised the crowd for winning that Senate race in Massachusetts. She said: 'Shoot, look at what you did in January. You shook up the United States Senate.' Unfortunately, no one heard the Senate thing, because after she said 'shoot,' 300 guns went off.

Democrats want to save all children from the horrors of Newtown CT, but subject 1.5 MILLION babies per year to abortions. The media has been having a fit about Newtown CT to support Obama's gun control initiatives. What does the Washington Post say about the total lack of coverage of the Kermitt Gosnell abortion-murder case in Pennsylvania? "It's just a local matter." Kermitt Gosnell ran an abortion charnel house murdering hundreds of viable babies by cutting their spinal chords with scissors! Per The daily Beast: Gosnell is accused of providing late-term abortions by inducing labor and then severing the fetus’ spinal cord with scissors. In some cases, the jury report says, the babies were “viable”—that is, they were breathing and moving. The report describes one such case. When the FBI raided Gosnell’s clinic in 2010, it was looking for evidence that he was selling prescription drugs, but agents said they found an scene of appalling medical neglect. From the grand-jury report: “There was blood on the floor. A stench of urine filled the air. A flea-infested cat was wandering through the facility, and there were cat feces on the stairs. Semiconscious women scheduled for abortions were moaning in the waiting room or the recovery room, where they sat on dirty recliners covered with blood-stained blankets.” Agents said there were aborted fetuses everywhere—in the refrigerator, in cat-food containers, in orange juice cartons—and a jar full of severed feet. His 17-year-old mother was almost 30 weeks pregnant—seven and a half months—when labor was induced. An employee estimated his birth weight as approaching 6 pounds. He was breathing and moving when Dr. Gosnell severed his spine and put the body in a plastic shoebox for disposal. The doctor joked that this baby was so big he could “walk me to the bus stop.”</Msg><Username>flightofthedoodoobird</Username><Timestamp>1365819393997</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 22:16:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365820806887-98</Id><Title>RNC Passes Unanimous Resolution Affirming GOP Is Still Against Gay Marriage</Title><Msg>This is just not Junior and Dumb's day!</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1365820806887</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 22:40:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365821055382-99</Id><Topic><Title>Firearm Deaths per 100,000 by state</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1365805639509</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 18:27:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How come you left this one out, Dumb the pecker-wood?
