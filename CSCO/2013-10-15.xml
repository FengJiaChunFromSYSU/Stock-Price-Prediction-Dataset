Well, let's ask Ronald Reagan: "We must reject the idea that every (time) a law is broken, society is guilty rather than the lawbreaker. It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions." Still, American Muslim leaders and organizations have consistently denounced terror attacks committed by Muslims -- including the recent Kenya attack. And not only did American Muslims denounce this recent incident, so did Muslim leaders in Kenya as well as the president of Somalia -- a Muslim. How could Bob Beckel not be aware of these facts? Maybe he hasn't figured out how to use Google yet? Or maybe he simply doesn't care about accuracy -- or both? And why would Beckel and his Fox News show have a discussion about Muslims without inviting at least one on? Do they not know even one American Muslim? Or is the reason more sinister? Does Fox News not want a Muslim-American on air to denounce the terror acts and present an American face of the faith because it undermines the narrative they have crafted about Muslims over the past few years? You will have to answer that. But I can tell you this: I personally wanted to get on Beckel's Fox News show to answer their questions and discuss a recently released comedy documentary I co-directed, "The Muslims Are Coming!" This film addresses the very point they are raising and uses comedy to dispel misconceptions about Muslims. But they said "no."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381847638622</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 10:33:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381847680559-13</Id><Title>anybody</Title><Msg>remember when Reagan raised taxes 5 times?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381847680559</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 10:34:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381847773724-14</Id><Topic><Title>FORBES ARTICLE EXPLAINS MASSIVE FAILURE OF OBAMMY CARE WEB SITE....maybe its true</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1381789892479</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-14 18:31:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Nothing about Medicare here."

She added, "Fox News Channel was just beginning. People are very -- it's a different world in terms of what people understand about what's going on.

The way most people—including congressional staffers—get health care is that their employer partially pays for it. The way the exchanges work is that the government provides subsidies so that people who don't currently get employer-provided insurance can afford to buy it. The Grassley amendment, on one reading, would create an anomalous situation where not only would congressional staff have to buy insurance on the exchanges they'd be taking a large de facto pay cut. That's because they'd be losing a valuable perk (employer-provided insurance) and given nothing in exchange for it. That doesn't really make sense as public policy, and certainly Grassley's intention wasn't to enact an across the board cut in congressional staff pay. He was just trolling. At any rate, the Office of Personnel Management stepped in and said they did not interpret the Grassley amendment in this way. Instead they read it as authorizing the government to redirect money currently spent on buying health insurance for congressional staff to subsidizing the purchase of insurance on Obamacare exchanges. Thus, congressional staff will participate in the exchanges and the exchange process but won't end up taking a pay cut. Somehow the conservative press convinced itself that this constituted a "special congressional exemption" from Obamacare or from the individual mandate. At this point David Vitter—whether out of stupidity or what I can't quite say—took up this banner and has been sponsoring legislation that would overrule the OPM and force the perverse reading of the Grassley amendment onto the government.That said, the problem for Republicans here is that the Vitter amendment is really dumb. It's entirely possible that if they pick the fight on these grounds, Democrats will have to cave. At which point congressional Republicans will have succeeded in cutting their staff's pay and not much else. Not anything else, in fact. The implementation of Obamacare won't be impacted at all even a tiny little bit.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381850219619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 11:16:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381850482312-31</Id><Topic><Title>the vitter amendment , LOL tea billies reach for a new stupid low</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381850219619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 11:16:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love Obamacare!</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1381850482312</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 11:21:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381850502247-32</Id><Title>House GOP fails to come up with a bill</Title><Msg>this is a big positive, it means the GOP is split and the sane GOPERS refuse to cave in to the crazy tea billies, this puts things back into the Senate and paves the way for bonehead to be forced to put a bill in front of the house that would violate the Hassart rule or let the country default and eliminate the GOP completely for a generation.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381850502247</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 11:21:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381850567214-33</Id><Title>What is this ?

On the Million Vet March homepage, the organizers suggest a local organizer invited Tea Party and birther groups against the wishes of the veterans: The political agenda put forth by a local organizer in Washington DC was not in alignment with our message. We feel disheartened that some would seek to hijack the narrative for political gain. The core principle is about all Americans honoring Veterans in a peaceful and apolitical manner. Ironically, Palin promised during her speech that she and other conservative public figures would “not be timid in calling out any who would use our military, our vets, as pawns in a political game.” Radical lawmakers and the Republican National Committee have tried to use veteran protesters to shift blame for the shutdown onto Obama. So far, this strategy doesn’t seem to be working. Polls show most Americans blame Republicans for the shutdown, and both the GOP and the Tea Party’s popularity are at all-time lows.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381856061765</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 12:54:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381856097687-81</Id><Title>My name headlines every liberal post</Title><Msg>it worships me like i am some sort of god.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1381856097687</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 12:54:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381856181993-82</Id><Title>Obama quote.</Title><Msg>"The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.

During a floor speech on Saturday, Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) drew attention to the quietly passed rule when he attempted to present a motion to accept the Senate's clean continuing resolution and reopen the government. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), presiding over the chamber, told Van Hollen that the rule he was asking to use had been "altered" and he did not have the privilege of bringing that vote to the floor. In the ensuing back and forth, Chaffetz said the recently passed House Resolution 368 trumped the standing rules. Where any member of the House previously could have brought the clean resolution to the floor under House Rule 22, House Resolution 368 -- passed on the eve of the shutdown -- gave that right exclusively to the House majority leader, Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia. "The Rules Committee, under the rules of the House, changed the standing rules of the House to take away the right of any member to move to vote to open the government, and gave that right exclusively to the Republican Leader," said Van Hollen.

Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) enthusiastically called for a government shut down saying he thought it was a good idea and "it's about time." "I was here during the government shutdown in 1995. It was a divided government. we had a Democrat president of the United States. We had a Republican Congress. And I believe that that government shutdown actually gave us the impetus, as we went forward, to push toward some real serious compromise," said Salmon.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381869354995</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 16:35:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381869578472-189</Id><Topic><Title>feds Fisher on CNBC</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381868691611</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 16:24:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since when has it been Fed policy to comment on pending legislation?

The economy has been gaining strength and a default now could reverse that progress, Dimon said. "Please, let's not shoot ourselves in the foot," he said. Deutsche Bank co-CEO Anshu Jain called the prospect of even a small default "utterly catastrophic." The CEOs spoke while US lawmakers struggled without success to reach an agreement that would avert default and end the 12-day government shutdown. The US might not be able to pay all its bills as early as October 17. "There isn't life beyond default," Jain said during the panel discussion with Dimon. "This would be a very rapidly spreading, fatal disease." The potential consequences are so unfathomable that Jain said he couldn't offer the audience any meaningful recommendations on how to react. "Europe was paralyzed at the possibility of an Italian default, which was a 2-trillion euro economy," Jain said, referring to the continent's debt crisis. A US default would be far worse with incurable legal problems, he said.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381869814173</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 16:43:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381869920618-195</Id><Topic><Title>when history is written</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381867781606</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 16:09:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumb dumb is an angry shut in. posting hate all day long on a stock message board. maybe it should spell check "two".

By analyzing data from Public Policy Polling, which provides not-quite-perfect results in 36 districts, Wang found that Republicans lost twice as much support over the shutdown in their gerrymandered districts than in red districts with boundaries that weren’t politically redrawn. “Isn’t that freaky?” Wang said when I spoke with him. Wang hypothesizes that this is because in 2011 a dominant GOP redistricting tactic wasn’t to pack districts with as many of their own supporters as possible; instead, Republicans wanted to concentrate as many of Democrats into as few districts as feasible and then spread their own loyalists across many districts to eke out wins. He says the results of 2011 redistricting are like what happened in North Carolina in the 2012 election: Republicans won nine seats by an average of 14 percentage points; Democrats won just four seats by a wide average margin of 40 percentage points. VIDEO: Obama: Shutdown Exactly What the Tea Party Wanted The rest of the GOP districts are largely filled with independents, who tend to amplify the national mood. “When they swing,” Wang says, “they swing really hard against you.” Now that the mood has turned negative on the GOP, these districts have turned down even more. Taking into account that the next House elections are more than a year away, Wang extrapolates that the disproportionate reaction to the shutdown puts “dozens more seats in play” in the 2014 election. It has, he estimates, turned the likelihood of Democrats taking over the House from 13 percent to as high as 50 percent. “If either party is paying attention to this information,” he adds, “I would presume that those gerrymandered states would be prime targets to carpet bomb with ads.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381873764083</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 17:49:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381874893092-228</Id><Title>Time to shut down the Executive Branch...</Title><Msg>Put Obama and the rest of them all on furlough, Senate too...</Msg><Username>proconsul_gallio</Username><Timestamp>1381874893092</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 18:08:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381875147715-229</Id><Topic><Title>Time to shut down the Executive Branch...</Title><Username>proconsul_gallio</Username><Timestamp>1381874893092</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-15 18:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yah, but keep the House.

These days, Reder passes a federal Farm Services Administration office whose doors are closed. Like most American ranchers, the 47-year-old is a resilient small businessman used to tending to his own problems, with help from neighbors whose families settled this land generations ago.
