A road map for delaying the inevitable effective dates of the Affordable Care Act provisions in order to squeeze all of their ill-gotten gains to the very last drop. Aetna Email to Insurance Brokers Aetna is encouraging their brokers to go to clients and renew their existing policies with an off-calendar effective date in order to delay the minimum policy requirements, premium limitations and pre-existing conditions provisions which take effect on January 1, 2014 or the renewal date of the policy. By changing the policy year to something other than December 31st, insurers will delay the effective date to the renewal for the year beginning in 2014 and ending in 2015. Of course, this won't affect their large corporate clients, but only small businesses and individuals. What a surprise! Even less of a surprise is the more-than-obvious effort to make sure everyone is angry, the economy is slagged because small employers are slammed with higher premiums than before, and just in time for the 2014 midterms, too! Did I mention that they're going to load up the costs to those employers for benefits they're not providing? Don't weep too much for Aetna, though. Their profits were right on target and rising for 2012, even though they whined about having to lower expectations for the final quarter. Wouldn't it be nice if Wall Street, et al understood that half the profits is still a profit, while the rest of us are sucking canal water trying to survive on less money and more expenses? In 1988, California voters passed an initiative requiring that all drivers buy insurance. Rates at the time were very high, and climbing higher on a daily basis. Insurers had a huge hissy fit over the initiative because it froze rates and forced a 20 percent reduction in following years. But now California's rates have dropped to mirror the nation</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1365264835215</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 12:13:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365265604416-44</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMANOMICS = 90 MILLION UNEMPLOYED AMERICANS MORE DAILY</Title><Username>kenya_bolshevik_from_chicago</Username><Timestamp>1365227622694</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 01:53:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Recession of 1937–1938 was an economic downturn that occurred during the Great Depression in the United States. By the spring of 1937 (like 2013), production, profits, and wages had regained their 1929 levels. Unemployment remained high, but it was slightly lower than the 25% rate seen in 1933. The American economy took a sharp downturn in mid-1937, lasting for 13 months through most of 1938. Industrial production declined almost 30 percent and production of durable goods fell even faster. The Roosevelt Administration reacted by launching a rhetorical campaign against monopoly power, which was cast as the cause of the depression (bash the banks -- now it's time to break up the banks. Too big to fail or jail. Some economists believed that banking reforms already were insufficient and that further reforms were warranted. Many suggestions put forward by Chicago economists in two 1933 memoranda that came to be known as the Chicago plan, were resurrected and recirculated in a 1939 draft proposal entitled A Program for Monetary Reform. Economists disagree about the causes of this downturn. Keynesian economists assign blame to cuts in federal spending and increases in taxes at the insistence of the US Treasury, while monetarists, such as Milton Friedman, assign blame to the Federal Reserve's tightening of the money supply in 1936 and 1937. Austrian school economist Johnathan Catalan assigns blame to the relatively large expansion of the money supply from 1933 to 1937. He also notes that the money supply did not tighten until after the recession began. Obama administration has re-created the Great Depression.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1365265604416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 12:26:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365265802405-45</Id><Topic><Title>OLOSER ADMIN.

About 160 workers were fired at a Friday morning meeting at Fisker's Anaheim, California, headquarters, according to a source who attended the meeting. They were told that the company could not afford to give them severance payments. Fisker confirmed in a statement that it let go about 75 percent of its workforce but did not specify the number of workers affected. It called the move "a necessary strategic step in our efforts to maximize the value of Fisker's core assets. Unfortunately we have reached a point where a significant reduction in our workforce has become necessary," Fisker said, adding that it was still searching for a strategic partner. The mass termination triggered a lawsuit seeking class-action status from angry former employees. A lawyer for the fired employees said he expects the company to file for bankruptcy "sooner rather than later."</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1365267794063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 13:03:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365267863647-49</Id><Title>OBAMA GIVES PLO TERORISTS $500 MILLION DOLLARS THEN CUTS RETIREE COLAS #$%$???</Title><Msg>OBAMA GIVES PLO TERORISTS $500 MILLION DOLLARS THEN CUTS RETIREE COLAS #$%$???

It was just announced that there were 45 million online streams of the NCAA March Madness Basketball Tournament games so far this year, up 158% from last year, with 60% of them over mobile devices! CCUR will capitalize most on this! CCUR's MediaHawk delivers video in any format, to any screen, over any network, at any time. MediaHawk multi-screen technology is now powering the multi-screen service of Virgin Media (VMED) the largest cable TV company in the UK. CCUR is powering a similar multi-screen video service for the largest cable TV company in Japan! CCUR was the 1st company to introduce video on demand (VOD) technology 13 years ago and they currently hold a 30% market share of the VOD market with 212 VOD deployments across 4 continents, reaching a total of 50mm VOD homes! CCUR closed Friday at $7.24 per share with only 9.2mm shares outstanding and a market cap of $66.6mm with $24.6mm in cash, no debt, and an enterprise value of only $42mm or just 0.67X its revenue of $62.59mm! CCUR's EPS has been ramping up big on a quarter-to-quarter basis from $0.02 to $0.04 and to $0.08 the past 3 quarters. CCUR's main competitor Seachange (SEAC) is a money losing but is already trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.81, which would make CCUR a $15 per share stock! CCUR's gross margins of 58.81% are higher than SEAC's gross margins of 50.18%, giving CCUR potential to at least double in the weeks ahead.</Msg><Username>jtdmnf533</Username><Timestamp>1365294208427</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 20:23:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365294468827-100</Id><Title>T-MOBIL ANNOUNCES 300 MORE LAYOFFS IN 2013.</Title><Msg>T-MOBIL ANNOUNCES 300 MORE LAYOFFS IN 2013.
