No real national conversation from the left.</Title><Msg>Posted: 30 Dec 2012 01:52 PM PST (Paul Mirengoff) Since President Obama wants us to have a “national conversation” about gun control, I hope it’s not amiss to add some data to the chit-chat. The Sacramento Bee reports that “gun deaths and injuries have dropped sharply in California, even as the number of guns sold in the state has risen, according to new state data.” To be specific: Dealers sold 600,000 guns in California last year, up from 350,000 in 2002, according to records of sale tallied by the California Attorney General’s office. During that same period, the number of California hospitalizations due to gun injuries declined from about 4,000 annually to 2,900, a roughly 25 percent drop, according to hospital records collected by the California Department of Public Health. Firearm-related deaths fell from about 3,200 annually to about 2,800, an 11 percent drop, state health figures show. . . . The number of California injuries and deaths attributed to accidental discharge of firearms also has fallen. The number of suicide deaths involving firearms has remained roughly constant. The Bee says that “most of the drop in firearm-related injuries and deaths can be explained by a well-documented, nationwide drop in violent crime.” As noted, though, the number of accidental deaths has also decreased and the number of suicides involving firearms hasn’t risen. It may be true that increased gun sales aren’t driving the number of deaths and injuries from guns down. But the burden is on gun control advocates to show that increased possession of guns is driving the number of deaths and injuries up. I haven’t seen such evidence. The statistics cited by the Bee don’t speak to the effect of increased firearm possession on types of crime such as robbery, burglary, and rape. Economist John Lott has long argued that wider gun ownership means less crime. Lott’s findings are hotly disputed by the left and it is not the purpose of this post to evaluate that debate. My point for now is that Lott’s argument that gun ownership deters crime is plausible enough, at least in certain contexts, that it must be part of any legitimate “national conversation” on gun control. Instead, the left throws a fit when Lott is called upon by media outlets to opine. It has no interest in a genunine national conversation. Neither, I suspect, does Obama. In any event, to answer Obama’s question, no, we’re probably not going to be able to have what can pass as a true national conversation.</Msg><Username>bullbear308</Username><Timestamp>1356916887641</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 20:21:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356917436162-76</Id><Topic><Title>Bottom line.

Try Kennesaw, GA. This quiet little town just a few miles north of Atlanta REQUIRES it's citizens to own a firearm... As the nation debates whether more guns or fewer can prevent tragedies like the Virginia Tech Massacre, a notable anniversary passed last month in a Georgia town that witnessed a dramatic plunge in crime and violence after mandating residents to own firearms. In March 1982, 25 years ago, the small town of Kennesaw – responding to a handgun ban in Morton Grove, Ill. – unanimously passed an ordinance requiring each head of household to own and maintain a gun. Since then, despite dire predictions of “Wild West” showdowns and increased violence and accidents, not a single resident has been involved in a fatal shooting – as a victim, attacker or defender. The crime rate initially plummeted for several years after the passage of the ordinance, with the 2005 per capita crime rate actually significantly lower than it was in 1981, the year before passage of the law.</Msg><Username>bullbear308</Username><Timestamp>1356918160032</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 20:42:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356918298766-80</Id><Topic><Title>No need to listen to Repubs, they are Losers!!!!</Title><Username>superdupershortysporty</Username><Timestamp>1356899498101</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 15:31:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can't discuss Economics with a Teapot.

Inasmuch as it makes sense to have a secret “terrorism watch list,” one would think a primary reason would be to prevent people who might commit terrorism from accessing the weapons that one uses to do so. Yet people on the watch list are still allowed to by guns: in 2010 alone, at least 247 people suspected of involvement with terrorism bought guns legally. While 71 percent of NRA membesr support closing the so-called “terror gap,” the NRA claims efforts to close the loophole are plots by “politicians who hate the Second Amendment.” Hey here is a great project for the Taliban!!

What is a "moonbat?" The word was created because of a particular liberal journalist, who recently wrote the following: "Mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts … These tragedies must end. And to end them, we must change." Every parent can connect with what President Barack Obama said about the murder of 20 children in Newtown, Connecticut. There can scarcely be a person on earth with access to the media who is untouched by the grief of the people of that town. It must follow that what applies to the children murdered there by a deranged young man also applies to the children murdered in Pakistan by a sombre American president. These children are just as important, just as real, just as deserving of the world's concern. Yet there are no presidential speeches or presidential tears for them, no pictures on the front pages of the world's newspapers, no interviews with grieving relatives, no minute analysis of what happened and why." Charles Monbiot, the original moonbat, and an ardent fan of Obama.
