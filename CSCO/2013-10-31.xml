Sabrina Siddiqui: "For all their fury, most of the House Republicans who had demanded their own closed-door briefing from the administration on President Barack Obama's struggling health care rollout were no-shows on Wednesday. Rep. John Fleming (R-La.) told reporters 'hat "about 20 members' attended the House GOP briefing, at which senior Health and Human Services Department official Mike Hash laid out some of the issues facing the Healthcare.gov website. The meeting was scheduled after House Republicans cried foul when they weren't included in last week's closed-door session with Democrats. The White House said Democrats had requested the briefing, but Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), deemed the snub 'all the more offensive after [HHS] Secretary Sebelius declined to testify' at a House committee hearing last Thursday on Obamacare."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1383228453470</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 10:07:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383228580740-30</Id><Topic><Title>Loons under their rocks</Title><Username>juniors_a_pedo</Username><Timestamp>1383228408272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 10:06:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Barry at 42 % and dropping.lolololololol But keep on cutting and pasting.lololololol</Msg><Username>juniors_a_pedo</Username><Timestamp>1383228580740</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 10:09:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383229125931-31</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary leaving Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1383176660519</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-30 19:44:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LADY SENATORS PEN SECRET LETTER - Hang in there, Martin O'Malley! "All of the female Democratic senators signed a secret letter to Hillary Rodham Clinton early this year encouraging her to run for president in 2016 – a letter that includes the signature of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other senators who are mentioned as potential candidates, two high-ranking Democratic Senate aides told ABC News. The letter, organized at the urging of Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., was meant to be a private show of support from a group of 16 high-profile former colleagues and fans who are now senators, urging Clinton to do what much of the Democratic Party assumes she will, the aides said. The existence of the letter was not revealed publicly until this week, when Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., mentioned it at an event in New York City on Monday. That was an apparent slip-up that prompted a round of apologetic e-mails from her Senate office to other offices on Capitol Hill, according to the aides."

Jon Stewart skewers CNN and Wolf Blitzer for ‘dumbing down’ the news: Rather than pick on CNN for its coverage of a specific issue, Daily Show host Jon Stewart ripped Wolf Blitzer and his colleagues on Tuesday for reducing more of their reporting to choosing between “good things” and “bad things.” “It’s like the word went out from CNN HQ: ‘Nobody watches this network unless they’re in the airport or going somewhere,’” Stewart guessed. “‘Eighty-six the professor talk and just let the people know, does this story go in my happy bag or my sad bag? Emoticon me, chop chop.’” After showing a few examples, Stewart played some of Michele Bachmann's recent interview with Wolf Blitzer where even she didn't want to play the "good things," "bad things" game with Blitzer. “Just want to make this clear,” an incredulous Stewart told his audience. “That’s Michele ‘I think vaccines give you brain damage’ Bachmann being told by Wolf Blitzer to dumb it down.” TeaNN... the most trusted name in news.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1383231390312</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 10:56:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383231485803-44</Id><Topic><Title>missing moron</Title><Username>juniors_a_genius</Username><Timestamp>1383231065376</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 10:51:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, are you making yourself look stupid today!!!

Blood clots can lead to devastating stroke, and death may occur. A clot can break off and travel to another part of the body — this can be dangerous should the clot travel to the lungs, leading to a pulmonary embolism, a life-threatening scenario, or to the brain, where it can cause a stroke. A blood clot in an artery or venous sinus can significantly reduce blood flow and cause a devastating stroke.

They don’t, however, want to talk about the more than 3 million Americans under 26 now on their parents’ coverage thanks to the law, how health care inflation has slowed dramatically since it was passed, or the millions and millions of working people who could end up “winners” because of the law. Why would they? After years of attempting to sabotage the law, the GOP received a huge gift in the bungled rollout of Healthcare.gov. Suddenly, their vague warnings of a “government takeover” of health care that would unleash a communist apocalypse were replaced by justifiable mockery of the site’s glitches and calls for Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius’ resignation. Of course, this required them to pretend that they actually wanted the website to work. This week, many Republicans realized they were boxing themselves into a corner if the site ever began to work as promised, which is supposed to happen by the end of November. So the discussion has moved to the 10-15 percent of Americans in the individual insurance market, some of whom are losing their insurance — mostly because it doesn’t meet the need requirements set out by the Affordable Care Act. These are plans that were most likely to be rated “fair to poor,” according to the Center for Health Research and Transformation. About half of these people will receive subsidies to purchase new plans and some may end up paying higher rates. The right-wing media has been searching for examples of people being screwed by these changes. But the nightmare scenarios they’ve been presenting keep turning out not to be that bad, upon just a little investigation. This is happening despite the president’s assurances that “if you like your plan, you can keep it,” even though the Affordable Care Act does “grandfather” in all plans that were in effect up until when the law passed in 2010. These are the things Republicans do want to talk about because they make either the law or President Obama look bad. And by focusing on these issues, they hope to distract from these five facts that are much more promising for the health care law. Since the government shutdown, Obamacare’s poll numbers have improved slightly but are basically where they’ve been for a year. More people disapprove of the law than approve, but most Americans want to keep it or pass something more liberal. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows that the public is even tolerant of the awful rollout of Healthcare.gov, with 37 percent saying “the website woes are a short-term technical problem that can be fixed” and another 30 percent saying it’s too soon tell. Less than a third of Americans, 31 percent, say that the problems “point to a longer-term issue with the law’s design that can’t be corrected.” Coincidentally, that’s about exactly the size of the GOP base. These numbers confirm what the Washington Post‘s Greg Sargent has been reporting: People want to give the law a chance. “Conservatives continue to claim the public is on their side when it comes to the use of scorched earth tactics against Obamacare – as if the law is such an obvious catastrophe that of course huge numbers of voters will support getting rid of it entirely and will support whatever means are necessary to destroy it. But even now, at a moment when the public is fully aware that the law is running into serious implementation problems, that just isn’t proving to be the case.” The right wing has been celebrating the cancellation notices they’re receiving. Meanwhile, they’re also noting that most of the people successfully signing up for Obamacare are getting fully subsidized Medicaid coverage, which is how Oregon reduced its uninsured population by 10 percent in just weeks. All of the people receiving cancellation notices will get new plans, if they can afford them; they cannot be denied based on pre-existing conditions. Republicans who would repeal or defund the law would not only cancel these plans, they would leave these people without coverage in a market where insurers could reject them. The New Republic‘s Jonathan Cohn contrasts the policies Republicans propose versus their anti-Obamacare rhetoric in his post “Guess Who Really Wants to Take Away Your Insurance: Republicans“: The real issue here isn’t simply Republican opportunism and hypocrisy—although, please, let’s not ignore that either. The real issue is about the true trade-offs of policy. Both sides offer them. With Obamacare, a small number of people lose their current insurance but they end up with alternative, typically stronger coverage. Under the plans Republicans have endorsed, a larger number of people would lose their current insurance, as people migrated to a more volatile and less secure marketplace. Under Obamacare, the number of Americans without health insurance at all will come down, eventually by 30 or 40 million. Under most of the Republican plans, the number of Americans without insurance would rise.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1383272086611</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 22:14:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383272098993-202</Id><Topic><Title>For Halloween, Pelosi decided to go as herself again this year ...</Title><Username>proconsul_gallio</Username><Timestamp>1383268206766</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 21:10:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SCCCOOOORRRRREEEE! lmao</Msg><Username>mrjasongayby</Username><Timestamp>1383272098993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 22:14:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383272241971-203</Id><Topic><Title>BREAKING!

They aren't taking into account how easy it is to check any "fact", quote or source with Google and Wikipedia, not to mention sites like Media Matters. If you do this regularly, you can get a different spin on articles. In the latest example, I was reading an article in Bloomberg News that is syndicated on many newspaper sites, "Health Policies Canceled in Latest Hurdle for Obamacare". Aside from quotes from Washington politicians and pundits, there is a story about Ian Hodge and his wife Sara, both 63. For Ian Hodge, 63, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, the issue is all about getting the same care from the same doctors. When he learned his policy was canceled his reaction was “surprise and disgust,” he said. Hodge said he tried 10 times to get information about a new policy on Oct. 1, the day the online federal exchange went live. He’s still trying to figure out his options, he said in a telephone interview. “The website is not very clear,” Hodge said. “I’m concerned about being able to get affordable health care that’s at least as good as what I had previously.” New Coverage Hodge and his wife Sara, who also is 63, paid $1,041.85 a month for a plan offered by Highmark, he said. They like the care, their hospital and the doctors, and they worry they won’t be able to keep them under a new plan. “I had heard the repeated assurances by the president and people who work for him that if you have health insurance, don’t worry, you’ll be able to keep your health insurance,” Hodge said in a telephone interview. “Well, that’s clearly not true. I wasn’t allowed to keep my health insurance.” So, this is just an average Joe getting screwed over by Obamacare. Or is he? Let's do some digging on the Google. The first thing I find is a LinkedIn profile describing Ian as an Independent Financial Professional with a degree in Political Science from Penn. OK, a degree in Political Science doesn't necessarily mean you aren't an average Joe. The next thing I see is information about Ian's home, valued at $481,500 on a three acre lot. That's nice, but nothing extraordinary. Next, I found an article from 2012 about a political flap about Ian's appointment to the township planning commission. Manheim Township Commissioner J. Michael Flanagan wondered out loud during Monday's meeting whether the appointment of township resident Ian Hodge to Manheim Township's planning commission was politically motivated. and later, Flanagan said during Monday's meeting that Hodge, a frequent critic of township spending in recent years, donated money to Heck and Kling's campaign last year, when the duo were running for commissioners' seats as a team. Ok, it seems like Ian is politically active. That doesn't mean he can't be an average Joe. Then I found a website of the Republican Committee of Lancaster County. On this page are listed the 2013 Republican Committee endorsed candidates. And near the bottom is our friend Ian, now running for Manheim Township Commissioner. Ian is not an average Joe. Ian is a Republican candidate for local office. That has some relevance to Ian's quotes in the Bloomberg article. I don't know about the facts Ian quotes, but his surprise, disgust, concern and worry could be politically motivated, don't you think? Couldn't Ian's run for office have been mentioned in the Bloomberg story? This is journalism missing the mark, at the very least. But, then I kept looking. This isn't the first time Ian has been quoted in a news article. In Lancaster Online from September 24, "Thousands of Highmark insurance customers in Central Pa. face cancellationsManheim Township man must shop for new policy Hodge, of Manheim Township, said the letter surprised him. "They're canceling my policy," he said. "That's not something that was supposed to happen under Obamacare." That article doesn't mention his run for office either, even though it is a local media outlet. One could naively think that Mr. Hodge just happened to be contacted by two media outlets for his views. I like to think Mr. Hodge has been contacting reporters, pushing his story. Evidently, when a reporter is offered a money quote out of the blue, he or she may just run with it. And that's why I like to Google news articles.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1383272540045</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 22:22:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383273037930-206</Id><Topic><Title>Just Google the "poor guy " with the Obamacare horror story</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1383272540045</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 22:22:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He never claimed to be poor or average.
