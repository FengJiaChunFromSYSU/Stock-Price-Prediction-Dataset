She should probably choose not to get pregnant with it. What to do with the body of the fetus is a decision of the society in general. Permitting a woman to have an abortion is a social decision which really just indemnifies the Doctor. He could not be prosecuted for perfoming a humanitarian euthanasia.

As Norquist read aloud a transcript of Chambliss’s earlier remarks, item by item, Norquist recalled later, the senator repeatedly assured him on each one that he didn’t mean to imply they had major differences when it came to GOP principles on taxes. “He said he’d wished he hadn’t invoked my name and wished that he’d been clearer,” Norquist recalled from the Monday conversation. Norquist said he came away from the conversation with this understanding of Chambliss’s position: “If he’d get a jillion dollars of spending cuts, he’d be willing to get rid of a deduction or two.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354493963169</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 19:19:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354495590692-116</Id><Topic><Title>gop licks grovers boots, just to funny</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354493963169</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 19:19:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You really need to find a better way to occupy your time other than this board.You come across as a bitter lonely recluse seeking attention.
