Chris Christie said Monday that President Barack Obama "has kept every promise he's made" about helping the state recover from Superstorm Sandy. Speaking on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program on the 6-month anniversary of the deadly storm, the Republican governor said presidential politics were the last thing on his mind as he toured storm-devastated areas with Obama last fall. "The president has kept every promise he's made," said Christie, widely considered a potential candidate for the republican presidential nomination in 2016. "I think he's done a good job. He kept his word." Christie's warm embrace of Obama after the storm angered some Republicans, who said it helped tip a close presidential election to the Democrat and away from Mitt Romney, who Christie endorsed and for whom he campaigned last fall.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367239762825</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 08:49:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367240485067-6</Id><Topic><Title>For a Marxist This Market is Soaring To Historic Highs Under Obama</Title><Username>usa_censored_citzen</Username><Timestamp>1367188114770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 18:28:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, and in Europe unemployment is as high as 25% in places. 60 years of Keynesian economics is a complete failure unless we don't count the debt, unemployment and poverty here and everywhere.</Msg><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1367240485067</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:01:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367240804838-7</Id><Topic><Title>More results from the communist party</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1367073483141</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 10:38:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This Week In Crazy — April 26 Edition April 26th, 2013 12:00 am Henry Decker 100 4: U.S. House Republicans House Republicans are also acting insane on the federal level, testing the classic definition of insanity by doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the “thing” in question is repealing Obamacare. The Hill reports that GOP freshmen are pushing for the House to hold a 37th vote on repealing the landmark health care law, apparently out of jealousy of their colleagues who have already tried and failed to do away with the law. “The guys who have been up here the last two years, we can go home and say, ‘Listen, we voted 36 different times to repeal or replace Obamacare.’ Tell me what the new guys are supposed to say?” second-term Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-SC) asked. Rep. Trey Radel concurred. “I want a chance as a freshman to do that, even if it’s just symbolic.” That Radel recognizes that the vote is purely symbolic is telling. Even though he knows that the bill won’t be repealed, and he should be able to tell from the 2012 elections that it won’t help his party at the polls, he still demands a vote anyway. Based on the 2012 campaign, it’s possible that they genuinely don’t have any other ideas.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367240804838</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:06:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367241311841-8</Id><Topic><Title>Hyper inflation next big economic event</Title><Username>pn1409</Username><Timestamp>1367161545759</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 11:05:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The people I know who bought gold when Glenn Beck told them to missed this historic rally.

Bush Presidential Library and Museum, the first library opened by Mr. Bush, located in Guantánamo, Cuba, celebrated its eleventh anniversary in January with considerably less pomp. And for Harland Dorrinson, who curates Mr. Bush’s other library, the lack of attention stings. “We’re actually the first George W. Bush library, if anybody cares to know,” Mr. Dorrinson said, adding that “no media whatsoever” covered the Guantánamo library’s eleventh anniversary. “They say that millions of people are going to visit the George W. Bush Library in Dallas every year,” he said. “On a good day, we’re lucky if we see one or two C.I.A. guys in between interrogations, looking for a Tom Clancy novel.” While Mr. Dorrinson said that he doesn’t expect his library to get the kind of attention likely to be enjoyed by its fancier counterpart in Dallas “any time soon,” he calls the absence of recognition “hurtful.” “It seems like there was a lot of excitement about this place when we opened in 2002,” he said. “When was the last time you heard anyone in Washington even say the word ‘Guantánamo?’” That’s a shame, he added, because the library at Guantánamo has a lot to offer that the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas doesn’t: “If you go to their Web site, you see that they’re closed some days. We’re going to be open forever.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367244984948</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:16:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367245155738-20</Id><Topic><Title>I thing dead</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367243168825</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 09:46:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think dumb dumb is incompetent and never worked an honest day in its life- harry reids friend told me so. i am not the one playing spell check know -it -all, boy you sure screwed the pooch on that one. we wonder why it cries for mommy government to coddle its failed life.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1367245155738</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:19:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367245180960-21</Id><Topic><Title>Now this is hurtful</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367244984948</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:16:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you talking about the library Obama promised to close by Jan.2010????

Another Sunday, another week with Bloody Bill Kristol pushing for more military intervention: Fox News Sunday Beats Syria War Drums: Subhed: Fox Analysts Urge "Irresponsible" Obama To Do "Something," But Won't Say What William Kristol wants to go to war in Syria, but he won't say what that war should look like. Appearing on Fox News Sunday to discuss reports of chemical weapons attacks in Syria, the Weekly Standard editor (and noted Iraq war hawk) attacked President Obama as "totally irresponsible" for indicating that he doesn't want "to start another war," saying: "You've got to do what you've got to do." When host Chris Wallace pointed out to him that there are "no good choices" for intervening in the Syrian conflict and asked, "so what do you do?," Kristol brushed it off without indicating how he thought the president should respond: "You do what you think is best. You're commander in chief, you've got an awful lot of options." They were all happy to use this as en excuse to amp up the rhetoric on Iran as well. Kristol didn't want to give specifics himself, but the one thing you can be sure of is, it won't matter how President Obama responds, they'll attack him later if things don't go well. Never mind that Wallace admitted there are no good options.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367245246289</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:20:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367245325005-23</Id><Title>did obama tax those rich people yet</Title><Msg>in the name of humanity.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1367245325005</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:22:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367245448299-24</Id><Title>Martha Stewart went to jail</Title><Msg>for doing what the government just passed a law saying it is ok for them to do. these are the people liberals want running their lives. makes sense why dumb calls itself dumb.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1367245448299</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:24:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367245666383-25</Id><Topic><Title>Obummer, totally irresponsible</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367245246289</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:20:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama was the one who drew the red line and called using chemicals a game changer...no one else.

Bush Liberry for Presidentin' on the SMU campus, Republican partisans have been trying to rehabilitate the presidency of the worst president in modern times. Well, at least two conservatives -- George Will and Matthew Dowd -- weren't buying any of it one bit on "This Week." WILL: Well the American people want to think well of presidents and ex-presidents. The problem with the Bush legacy is the tensions within it. Arguably his greatest decision was the surge. But the surge was to correct for the disastrous implementation of the invasion of Iraq which itself never should have happened, we now know. Second, his greatest legacy are two superb Supreme Court candidates, nominees, now justices. On the other hand, one of them came after a disastrous suggestion, Harriet Miers. In Afghanistan you had an invasion he had to take, but you had terrible mission creep afterwards and we got into the business of nation building. The prescription drug entitlement, the first major entitlement he ever passed without a dedicated funding source, aggravated the coming crisis of the welfare state. And his favorite piece of legislation, "No Child Left Behind" offended every conservative instinct by nationalizing, further nationalizing a quintessential state and local responsibility. STEPHANOPOULOS: Matthew Dowd you worked for the president for several years. Broke over the Iraq War. DOWD: Well yeah and I was there for the first five years of the administration, as you say, broke over the Iraq War. I think it was a great moment.

But for now, Glenn Beck appears undeterred, telling his viewers last night that "there's a 77 percent chance of a [stock market] crash within the next 30 days." Only thing is, he said that 40 days ago. Back in August, Glenn Beck clownishly criticized President Obama for having a Ramadan dinner in the midst of a major financial event: the stock market had met the requirements "for a Hindenburg Omen," which "serves as a technical indicator of impending stock market crashes." Beck explained that once the five requirements are triggered, a 5 percent drop in the market "usually takes place within the next 40 days": BECK: Well, we met the requirements for a Hindenburg Omen on Friday. Yes, he was having a Ramadan dinner while these things were happening. You see, there's about five of these things that are very technical and I don't want to bore you with all the details. Looking back at history -- the probability of all these things happening means that there is a market move greater than 5 percent to the downside after confirmed Hindenburg Omen. That means we're going to have a market go down at least 5 percent and the chances of that, with all of these things happening, is about 77 percent. So, a market crash is not a mortal lock when the omen is in effect, but every New York Stock Exchange crash since 1985 has been preceded by the Hindenburg Omen. And the 5 percent move usually takes place within the next 40 days. Beck further warned that it would not be "real wise" to ignore this information because the "perfect storm" that has been brewing "is going to wash ashore and there will be nothing we can do about it if we haven't already battened down the hatches." On August 25, Beck returned to the Hindenburg Omen and said: "When it's triggered, a market crash happens 77 percent of the time.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367247072439</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 10:51:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367247117772-37</Id><Topic><Title>Jesse says Bush either knew about it or had a hand in it themselves</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359506659597</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:44:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>like JFK is tied to Vietnam? or more like you are tied to the board Idiot?

Bush has cancelled a visit to Switzerland, where he was to address a Jewish charity gala, due to the risk of legal action against him for alleged torture. Bush was to be the keynote speaker at Keren Hayesod's annual dinner on Feb. 12 in Geneva. But pressure has been building on the Swiss government to arrest him and open a criminal investigation if he enters the Alpine country. Criminal complaints against Bush alleging torture have been lodged in Geneva, court officials say. Human rights groups said they had intended to submit a 2,500-page case against Bush in the Swiss city on Monday for alleged mistreatment of suspected militants at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba where captives from Afghanistan, Iraq and other fronts in the so-called War on Terror were interned.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367251718773</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:08:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367251798499-57</Id><Title>GENEVA, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Former U.S. President George W.

"I was telling myself in my head before don't say bomb. When you try to suppress Tourette's, it comes out even worse," said Michael Doyle. Peter Doyle, 49, said he arrived at Washington, D.C.'s Reagan National Airport Thursday with medical documentation describing his condition. Doyle and his friend got through security but after sitting in the boarding area, a JetBlue pilot heard Doyle say bomb and refused to let him on the flight. Those with Tourette syndrome often can't control verbal tics. Doyle, who constantly watched coverage of the Boston Marathon bombings, said he arrived at the airport worried about what he was going to say. "I probably said bomb about 100 times in that terminal, and through TSA," Doyle said. After Doyle was not allowed on the flight, his friend stayed with him, missing their 18th century battle reenactment in Puerto Rico, which they had planned for two years. "It is very frustrating, especially after three hours of sitting there and two years planning, and it just doesn't happen," Chaz Petteway, 20, said. JetBlue said, "After further investigation, the situation was deemed innocuous" and offered Doyle a round trip ticket, but there is no guarantee he will be able to board another flight. While the situation was frustrating for Petteway and Doyle, it shows a country still at a heightened state of alert two weeks after the twin bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. "Tensions are high. People are worried, they're nervous, they know there have been terrorist attacks," ABC News consultant and former pilot Steve Ganyard said.

It’s official; George W Bush is a war criminal. In what is the first ever conviction of its kind anywhere in the world, the former US President and seven key members of his administration were yesterday (Fri) found guilty of war crimes. Bush, #$%$ Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and their legal advisers Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Jay Bybee and John Yoo were tried in absentia in Malaysia. The trial held in Kuala Lumpur heard harrowing witness accounts from victims of torture who suffered at the hands of US soldiers and contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. They included testimony from British man Moazzam Begg, an ex-Guantanamo detainee and Iraqi woman Jameelah Abbas Hameedi who was tortured in the notorious Abu Ghraib prison. At the end of the week-long hearing, the five-panel tribunal unanimously delivered guilty verdicts against Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their key legal advisors who were all convicted as war criminals for torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367252659136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:24:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367252722867-64</Id><Topic><Title>OH NO Chambers is going to talk get ready for the 2 dollar drop</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367252337942</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:18:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WOW Chambers is worried</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367252722867</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:25:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367252815851-65</Id><Topic><Title>Does the Bush library note</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367250977183</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 11:56:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At the end of the week-long hearing, the five-panel tribunal unanimously delivered guilty verdicts against Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and their key legal advisors who were all convicted as war criminals for torture and cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment Don't confuse the teabillies with facts dumb.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1367252815851</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:26:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367253056199-66</Id><Topic><Title>I was banned from my flight on Jet Blue because of my Tourettes !</Title><Username>dumbpainting</Username><Timestamp>1367252018931</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 12:13:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A man with Tourette syndrome says he was not allowed to board a flight at Reagan National Airport because he said the word bomb close to 100 times.

Appearing on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) laid out the situation in stark terms: “The time for President Obama to do something in Syria that we can eviscerate him for is long overdue.” Arguing that there are a variety of options available to Mr. Obama for dealing with Syria, Sen. Graham said, “The President needs to choose one of those options so that we can immediately identify it as a catastrophic choice and demand that he be impeached.” Sen. John McCain (R-Arizona) used an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” to express impatience with Mr. Obama’s “steadfast refusal to give us something new to rake him over the coals for.” “The American people have grown weary of my nonstop criticism of the President’s handling of Libya,” he said. “They are ready to hear me incessantly berate him for his handling of a different country.” At the end of his television appearance, Sen. McCain seemed to draw a line in the sand, making a direct challenge to Mr. Obama: “Mr. President, we are sick and tired of attacking you for your inaction. The time has come for us to attack you for your action.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367259280896</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 14:14:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367259731436-114</Id><Topic><Title>Remember whey dead aka Ivan posted this, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1367255405971</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 13:10:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumb will hide for awhile now or switch ids to fool us.

Gore, the Supreme Court case that decided the 2000 presidential election. Looking back, O’Connor said, she isn’t sure the high court should have taken the case. “It took the case and decided it at a time when it was still a big election issue,” O’Connor said during a talk Friday with the Tribune editorial board. “Maybe the court should have said, ‘We’re not going to take it, goodbye.’” The case, she said, “stirred up the public” and “gave the court a less-than-perfect reputation.” “Obviously the court did reach a decision and thought it had to reach a decision,” she said. “It turned out the election authorities in Florida hadn’t done a real good job there and kind of messed it up. And probably the Supreme Court added to the problem at the end of the day.“ I’ll go out on a limb and say that O’Connor’s regret has less to do with the court having accepted the case (which it should not have) as it has to do with her voting with the other four conservatives on the bench in the 5-4 decision. It’s anyone’s guess as to whether 9-11 would have happened under a Gore presidency. It would be nice to think that Gore would have taken seriously the August 6 intelligence briefing titled, “Bin Laden Determined To Strike in U.S.” instead of dismissing it as Bush did by telling the briefer, “All right. You’ve covered your #$%$, now.” We can’t know for sure what would have happened with 9-11…but you sure as hell know that had O’Connor not cast her vote with the other Republican-appointed judges in Bush v. Gore, there would have been no #$%$ Cheney in the administration. No Cheney to bring his neocon fantasies to life would have meant no Iraq war. No Iraq war would have meant no trillion dollar deficit added to the debt. No 4500 dead Americans. No 100,000 to 500,000 dead Iraqis. No added reason to fuel worldwide contempt for America thereby giving rise to more acts of terrorism. I’ll go out on a limb and say that</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367260777527</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 14:39:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367261609886-123</Id><Topic><Title>He was just "a simple minded man".....</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1367260777527</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 14:39:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Over twelve years ago and still whining.

And now one of Washington's other cherished myths—the lack of workers trained in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM, for short)—has been demolished. The U.S. has "more than a sufficient supply of workers available to work in STEM occupations," a study released Wednesday by the Economic Policy Institute has found. In fact, we're producing far more STEM graduates than we can place in jobs. Some bullet points from the summary: "For every two students that U.S. colleges graduate with STEM degrees, only one is hired into a STEM job." "In computer and information science and in engineering, U.S. colleges graduate 50 percent more students than are hired into those fields each year; of the computer science graduates not entering the IT workforce, 32 percent say it is because IT jobs are unavailable, and 53 percent say they found better job opportunities outside of IT occupations. These responses suggest that the supply of graduates is substantially larger than the demand for them in industry." "Over the past decade IT employment has gradually increased, but it only recovered to its 2000–2001 peak level by the end of the decade." "Wages have remained flat, with real wages hovering around their late 1990s levels." The important policy implication is that the massive push for increasing visas for high tech workers is misconceived. We do not have a worker shortage at all. What's more, the push for more foreign workers might be counterproductive, since it likely result in fewer Americans seeking training and jobs in technology. "Immigration policies that facilitate large flows of guestworkers will supply labor at wages that are too low to induce significant increases in supply from the domestic workforce," the study said. It's important to note that the Economic Policy Institute is a left-leaning think tank. Its conclusions cannot be chalked up to a bias against immigration.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1367268425810</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 16:47:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367268447323-151</Id><Title>GHAY IS PATHOLOGIC....</Title><Msg>said it before, say it again, gay is a pathologic lifestyle.

People with diabetes are 'born that way', but they still have early heart disease, renal failure and loss of limbs to ischemic vascular changes. No one HATES gay people or diabetics. But both have to deal with pathology. For the diabetic to say, 'leave me alone, i want to eat sugar and it's none of your business, if you stopped interfering in my lifestyle, I'd be truly happy. let me eat more doughnuts, leave me alone, stop telling me what to do!", HEY....no problem. As a diabetic you can do as you wish, but there are consequences...gay folks suffer consequences that have nothing to do with me or you.
