The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can't find work." THE FACTS: The number of unemployed is 12.5 million, not 23 million. Romney was also counting 8 million people who are working part time but would like a full-time job and 2.6 million who have stopped looking for work, either because they are discouraged or because they are going back to school or for other reasons. He got the figure closer to right earlier in the debate, leaving out only the part-timers when he said the U.S. has "23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work." But he was wrong in asserting that Obama came into office "facing 23 million people out of work." At the start of Obama's presidency, 12 million were out of work. His claim that half of college graduates can't find work now also was problematic. A Northeastern University analysis for The Associated Press found that a one-fourth of recent graduates were probably unemployed and another quarter were underemployed, which means working in jobs that didn't make full use of their skills or experience.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1349413151914</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 00:59:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349413573684-2</Id><Title>3 days until we know how much Obama damage Romney did</Title><Msg>I bet even the 8 point oversampling of Dems won't help Mr. Hopeless/Changeless.

The dreams of his youth have yellowed with age and are now peeling, broken and blotched. The idea that a powerful central government could solve problems, bring fairness, equity and justice to a system was ever his hope, ever his dream. It was always flawed, but the stupidity of youth hid those flaws. We now all see that the only hope for America is the American. The individual, the creativity of Jobs, the technical insight, the hubris of the American ingenue, the American creator, the mom and pop places, the corporate energy, all this provides the answers that Government cannot now nor ever could create. So Surfy is sad, as anyone would be at the fading of youth, and the hard reality of life. We on the other hand, rejoice at the glory that was once and will be again, the American century!

(tax policy center (non-partisan)) ----- lie #3: romney says he won't reduce taxes on the wealthy. the reality: in fact, that’s exactly what his plan would do. ----- lie #4: romney claims his tax plan isn’t like anything we’ve tried before. the reality: it’s the same trickle-down grift we’ve seen from cons for more than 30 years. ----- lie #5: romney swears his policies won’t affect current seniors’ social security. the reality: his tax plan would increase taxes paid by social security recipients. ----- lie #6: romney says his tax plan won’t cost $5 trillion. the reality: his plan has been scored as costing $5 trillion, by respected nonpartisan sources – and this $5 trillion would be *in addition to* the cost of extending the bush tax cuts indefinitely (which he also advocates). ----- lie #7: romney claims his plan won’t add to the deficit. the reality: his plan would add nearly $500 billion to the nation's credit card *each and every year* ----- lie #8: romney claims there are six^ studies that have called his plan revenue neutral. (^a few weeks ago, he claimed it was five) the reality: of the original five so-called "studies," two were just wsj editorials, while the three others were ideologically driven advocacy papers thinly disguised as "studies." (as nearly as i can tell, the new 6th so-called "study" mitt cites was a synopsis of one of the three prior advocacy briefs, summarized for inclusion in that same right-wing think-tank's monthly newsletter.) ----- lie #9: romney says his plan won’t cut education. the reality: if cuts were applied pro rata with education's current share of the budget, it would mean a cut to education of more than $115 billion over the next decade. (and in fact, romney has already said that *no* required cuts will be taken from the defense budget - quite to the contrary, he says he will *increase* defense spending by two trillion dollars - meaning that required cuts to other parts of the federal budget will have to be even deeper, in order to make up the difference.) ----- lie #10: romney claims his energy plan will make north america energy independent. the reality: did you believe sarah palin when she advocated the same policy in 2008? ----- lie #11: romney’s plan will “deal with" people with pre-existing conditions. reality: actually, this one might be technically true, assuming mitt was using the phrase "deal with" euphemistically (or more to the point, euthanistically). in fact, he would repeal obamacare and it’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions, putting them back at the mercy of insurance companies, who will continue to avoid them like the plague. ----- lie #12: romney claims he was a bipartisan governor. the reality: he barely made *any* attempt to work with democrats in the massachussetts legislature, whether to persuade them or to advocate for his positions. instead, he attempted to impose his will much as a corporate ceo deals with subordinate employees. this had a rather predictable effect, and mitt "got out of the kitchen" tout de suite, after a single 4-year term. (and btw, fyi, he and his staff took the computers when they left - very tidy, these republicons...)</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1349441325817</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 08:48:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349442962237-14</Id><Topic><Title>You need to see this Report!

But here is the partisan distribution of the most recent Florida media polls: 9-26: CBS/NY Times = 36% Dem / 27% Rep 9-23: Wash Post = 35% Dem / 29% Rep So the media polls reflect a 9 point and six point Democratic edge even though the actual experience of the past four elections has been a 1 point Republican advantage. Things are no better in Ohio. Here, McLaughlin finds a 2 point Democratic edge in the past four elections (38% Dem, 36% Rep). But the media polls show vastly more Democrats and fewer Republicans in their samples: 9-26: CBS/NY Times = 35% Dem / 26% Rep 9-23: Wash Post = 35% Dem / 27% Rep 9-11: NBC/Wall St Journal = 38% Dem / 28% Rep Once again, the actual exit poll-measured vote in Ohio shows a 2 point Democratic edge, but the polls reflect Democratic advantages of 9 points, 8 points, and 10 points respectively. In Virginia, it's the same story. The last four elections have a combined 1 point Republican edge, 37-36. But the media polls show a big pro-Democratic bias: 10/2: Roanoke College = Dem 36% / Rep 27% 9/17: CBS/NYTimes = Dem 35% / Rep 26% 9/16: Washington Post = Dem 35% / Rep 24% 9/11: NBC/Wall St Journal = Dem 31% / Rep 26% So instead of showing a 1 point Republican edge, these media poll samples show Democratic advantages of 9,9,11, and 5. The correct conclusion to draw from all these polls is that Romney is comfortably ahead in Virginia and Florida while he holds a slight lead in Ohio. And, remember these polls are all pre-debate! Also, bear in mind that the undecided vote in all of these polls usually goes against the incumbent. That's the real story.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349446329992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:12:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349446594163-23</Id><Title>I am not surprised UE is now claimed to be under 8%, pure fantasy</Title><Msg>Jack Welch says its #$%$.
