Of course it is not true and this pronouncement comes from a liberal think tank, but hey it sounds so good doesn’t it? What’s laughable is that The Rockefeller Foundation and Yale professor Jacob Hacker claim this “improvement” is proven by the fact that the percentage of California’s families reporting a major economic loss last year dropped by 1.4% which is a whole .10% better than the national average. The fact that California is so economically distressed and has been for so long that there are few families left to experience economic losses doesn’t seem to enter into Professor Hacker’s formula. Now for so reality: according to those who study the fiscal and economic health of a state, a much more honest measurement is the “U-Haul Index” which examines the cost of moving in or out of a given state. The latest U-Haul Index the one way cost of renting a 20 foot truck to go from San Francisco to San Antonio Texas is $1,693 yet making the trip in reverse costs only $983.00 for the same truck. People are voting again, only this time no amount of vote fraud can change the outcome. Americans are moving with their feet. They are packing up and leaving California and its insane policies for the relative financial safety of Texas. The exodus is being fuelled by higher and higher taxes higher unemployment (even with Democrats announcing the numbers) forced union membership and a hostile climate for business in California. On the scale of friendliness toward business California stands the 48th out of the 50 states and Texas is just 9th. The tax burden is 1/3 less in Texas than it is in California. The percentage of Californians in poverty is growing so far that although it represents 12% of the nation’s population it accounts for 1/3 of all of America’s welfare recipients. In each of the last eight years Texas has been the number one state for inward migration and California has been dead last in this category. Let the Ivory Tower preach empty words about things improving in California, but the truth looks like things aren’t getting better. The voice of the people is too loud to be ignored; California is the place to be from and Texas is the place to go.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1353942815645</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 10:13:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353943382534-19</Id><Topic><Title>when you open your eyes and look at the real world</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353940964000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 09:42:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, she should probably do every bit of research herself.

OUR COWARDS HERE CAN LEARN SOMETHING FROM HER The body of a woman once called a 'heroine of the 21st century' for fearlessly standing up to Mexico's brutal drug cartels has been found beaten to death at the side of a road. Maria Santos Gorrostieta, 36, was the former mayor of Tiquicheo, a rural district in Michoacan, west of Mexico City. She famously survived two assassination attempts by narcotics gangs who have turned the country into a war zone. Her brave defiance may have cost the mother-of-three her life. The official cause of death was a blow to the head but she had been stabbed, her legs and hands had been bound and her waist and chest were covered in burns, suggesting she had been tortured. She was discovered by residents of the community of San Juan Tararameo, Cuitzeo Township, who were heading to work in the fields. Her family had reported her missing on November 14, and the disappearance was being investigated by the Anti-Kidnapping and Extortion Institution. A murder investigation has now been launched. The first assassination attempt was while in October 2009 when the car she was travelling in with her husband Jose Sanchez came under fire from gunmen in the town of El Limone. The attack claimed his life but Gorrostieta lived. An attempt had been made on Sanchez's life earlier that year, but he managed to escape the armed mob who came after him. Gorrostieta, who had been elected in 2008, bravely battled back from her injuries in the face of overwhelming tragedy, but she was not destined to know peace. The next attempt on her life was just three months later, when an masked group carrying assault rifles ambushed her on the road between Michoacan and Guerreo state. The van she was traveling in was peppered by 30 bullets. Three hit her. This time Gorrostieta's injuries were more severe, leaving multiple scars and forcing her to wear a colostomy bag. She was left in constant pain.</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1353953691603</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 13:14:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353954016836-48</Id><Topic><Title>LORD AND SAVIOR OBIMBO!!!</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1353947813994</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 11:36:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Drooling parrots can say 'racist' easier than 'incompetent boob and disastrous, archaic, antique, and discredited economic and social projects make Democrats the party of FAIL'....HMMMMMMM</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1353954016836</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 13:20:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353954125478-49</Id><Topic><Title>LORD AND SAVIOR OBIMBO!!!</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1353947813994</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 11:36:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(It's not Obimbo's half black side we dislike) It is his stupidity that no one likes, he just uses the black, to get what he wants.

He has no plan. At least Romney had a 59 point plan. The Obama road map includes $1 trillion in savings from a 2011 congressional deal (already in current bloated "non-budget" deficit) and another mythical $848 billion from the end of the Iraqi and Afghan wars (no real savings.) In short, his plan reflected previous agreements and military spending that had already been discontinued. His only idea is to tax the rich which is a drop in the bucket and solves nothing.

The Transportation Ministry says it is considering adding bus lines between West Bank roadblocks and central Israel; these would be geared toward Palestinian laborers. Still, such a plan would take at least a few months to go into effect. Earlier this month a bus operated by Afikim, a company with a government tender to serve West Bank settlements, pulled up at a police roadblock near the settlement of Elkana. The police, who later cited security reasons, ordered all the Palestinian passengers off - leaving them to walk several kilometers to the nearest checkpoint and pay for a taxi home, said an Israeli army reservist who was posted at the checkpoint. He told Haaretz that the laborers, most of whom work in the Tel Aviv area and usually take the bus home, were angered by the incident. That wasn't the only time the workers were pulled off the bus, though. "Friends at the checkpoint told me that the same thing happened the next day," said the reservist. "The police confiscated their ID cards, brought the IDs to the checkpoint, and the Palestinians had to get off the bus again and walk several kilometers to the checkpoint." Commenters left offensive responses to the post, with one referring to the Palestinian passengers as terrorists and another as monkeys.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353988612243</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 22:56:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353989110470-127</Id><Title>Pukes/Teabaggers are such a bag of PATHETIC CRYBABIES!!!!!!</Title><Msg>YOU LOST!!!!
