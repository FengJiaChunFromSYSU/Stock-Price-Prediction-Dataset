On Thursday, President Obama will ascend the stage at Bank of America stadium and try to rekindle the enthusiasm and fervor that greeted his acceptance speech in Denver in 2008. Then, Democrat officials worried about having to turn people away from the speech. Today, they worry about simply filling the seats. And no wonder; the Democrat party has shrunk dramatically during Obama's term in office. Obama's policies haven't helped many Americans. But, they have been an absolute bonanza to one particular group of job-seekers: Republican candidates. Not since Ronald Reagan has any President done more to build up a thriving and energetic GOP. Let's review the carnage inflicted on the Democrat party since Obama took office. In Jan. 2009, there were 56 Democrats in the U.S. Senate. (With Democrat caucusing Independents and a party switch, this figure hit 60 early in Obama's term) Today, there are 51 with the very real prospect of fewer come November. In the House, Democrats controlled the chamber with 257 seats. Today they have just over 190. In the states, Democrats controlled both chambers of the legislature in 27 states. The GOP controlled just 14. (The rest were split-control, with each party controlling one chamber.) Today, the situation is completely reversed, with GOP controlling 27 states to the Democrats 15. There are more GOP state legislators today than at any time since 1928. Democrats controlled the Governor's mansion in 29 states. Today, they hold the Governor's office in only 20 states, and will likely lose more this November. But, it isn't just Democrat office-holders who are gone. Rank-and-file Democrats have disappeared since Obama took office. When Obama won the Presidency, 41% of voters identified themselves as Democrats. Today, just 33% of voters identify as Democrats. Moreover, the number who identify as Republican is at an all time high of 37.6%. Last month, the liberal group Third Way looked at party registrations in eight battleground states. In just those eight states, Democrats lost 800,000 voters from their rolls since Obama took office. Democrat voter registrations in those eight states are down more than five percentage points. Virtually every poll looking at the Presidential race is assuming a partisan turnout very similar to 2008. That isn't going to happen. Too many Americans have simply left the Democrat party.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1346733846883</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 00:44:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346734989177-3</Id><Topic><Title>"OSAMA DEAD, GM ALIVE"!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346707414226</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 17:23:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Even if he is wrong 99% of the time.

Only the people that DIDN'T HAVE TO CASH OUT to save their home or have cash to live on because they were unemployed made money? And that is good ? If the economy is so much better why do we need more stimulus and more debt? Simple, it is not better. The DEMS talk about Wall Street running wild like a casino and that is exactly what they have created with interest rates this low through QE and operation twist. They are letting the FED run wild. Dollar goes down, commodities go up , XOM /CVX go up , market goes up, consumer gets squeezed.... down we go again. Rinse and Repeat. Savers are getting killed by inflation ( the real inflation, things we buy everyday). Those savers are retirees that don't have the time to recover from a loss. The avg person has a managed retirement account they can't touch yet and we all know you don't have a real profit till you sell. And that is good? BTW: Use the same components of the DOW/SP500 from 2008 and see where we really are(C &amp; AIG where 2 taken out). The DOW is an exclusive club, they don't keep losers in it. Most of the stocks in the DOW and SP500 derive at least 40% of the earnings from over seas. Yeah things are just ducky!!!!</Msg><Username>robertacaldia</Username><Timestamp>1346737180692</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 01:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346737328401-6</Id><Topic><Title>BLOODY TUESDAY: August 21, 2012, A Day That Will Live in Infamy...</Title><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1346705130154</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 16:45:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>REPUKES love authoritarian regimes.

However, only about half of the $787 billion has been applied for, so it has not all been spent and looks like it won't all be spent. About half of what has been applied for and used has been paid back as well. And Obama has drastically cut spending in all other areas save education and national defense. The budget Obama was allowed was $3.4 trillion; but it looks like he won't even reach that high. As a comparison, Bush's budget was $3.1 trillion last year, but Obama's budget includes the wars when Bush's budget does not. Obama's budget also had to deal with the $1.4 trillion deficit Bush left him from last year, while Bush's budget was only hampered by the $500 billion deficit left from the 2007 fiscal year. Obama has called for spending so far of about $1.2 trillion. However, since only half of it was used, and half of that paid back, it is really closer to about $250 billion total spent so far. Add-on: Obama has severely cut spending. Republicans are more than happy to tell you his budget is $3.6 trillion, which number 1 is an exaggeration. It is $3.4 trillion, which is already $200 billion less than what Republicans say it is. Again, Bush's final budget was $3.1 trillion, already within $300 billion of Obama's actual budget. There are many reasons this is important. First up is deficits. I already pointed that out, but here is the math. Bush's budget last year was hampered by a $500 billion deficit he left himself from 2007; but Obama's current budget is hampered by a $1.4 trillion deficit Bush left him from last year. That is a $900 billion bigger hole that Bush put Obama in than he put himself in. Obama was only ahead in spending by $300 billion; now Bush is ahead in spending by $600 billion. Next up is the wars. While Obama's budget does include the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, Bush's budget did not include either war. The estimated cost of the Iraq War is $10 billion a month, $120 billion a year. Afghanistan is $2 billion a month, $24 billion a year. Since we are working with the year, we will add $120 billion for Iraq and $24 billion for Afghanistan to Bush's total; to make it fair and hold him to the same standard Obama is being held to. That is $144 billion that needs to be added to Bush's total. Bush was ahead in spending by $600 billion; it is now $744 billion. And finally, Bush's bailout. Obama's bailout is already in his budget, so does not need to be added again. Republicans played some games with Bush's bailout, however. When Bush's bailout first got up for a vote, it was $700 billion. It was soundly defeated in the House of Representatives by the House Republicans. They were hailed as Conservative heroes. So the authors of the bill went back and added $150 billion in Republican pork spending to the bill to attract those Republicans. The bill was now $850 billion, and guess who voted for it? That's right, the House Republicans. The original $700 billion Bush asked for was given to him and his Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson. But they felt they could not spend it all in the little time they had left; so they hit upon a plan in which they would split the money in half, keep $350 billion and give the other $350 billion to Obama's team. Bush and Paulson then promptly lost their own half by not having a tracking system in place. It is somewhere in the economy, but no one can figure out where. This is where Rush and Hannity took over. Because we did not find out Bush had lost the money until after Obama got to office, they tried to blame Obama for that lost $350 billion. On top of that, they also tried to blame Obama for that $150 billion in Republican pork spending. While it was approved during Bush's term by Republicans in Congress, it was not spent until Obama's term. Rush used that to try and blame that spending on Obama. That is $500 billion that was not counted against Bush when it should have been. He was ahead in spending by $744 billion; when you add that money back to him it now goes to $1.244 trillion more than what Obama is spending. But that $500 billion was also unfairly counted against Obama, and now must be taken away. So when you take it away, Bush outspent Obama by $1.744 trillion. That means that Obama has managed to cut spending by $1,744,000,000,000. Obama has cut Bush's spending by nearly $2 trillion.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1346772613658</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 11:30:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346772726293-54</Id><Title>Today</Title><Msg>Auto Industry a 'Bright Spot' as Ford Sales Up 14%, GM Up 10% (Update 2) DETROIT -- (TheStreet) -- Automakers are reporting strong August sales as the auto industry remains a bright spot in a mediocre economy. vs 4 years ago Collapse of US auto industry looms Nov 13, 2008 DETROIT // Advocates for US automakers are warning that the collapse of the Big Three - or even just General Motors - could set off a catastrophic chain reaction in the economy, eliminating up to 3 million jobs and depriving governments of more than $150 billion in tax revenue.

That's unfortunate, because that crusade has been an expensive catastrophe both domestically and internationally. During the decades since Richard Nixon declared a "war" on illegal drugs in 1971, the United States has spent nearly one trillion dollars trying to eradicate the drug trade, filled America's prisons with nonviolent drug offenders, ruined millions of lives and undermined the Bill of Rights -- especially the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. Beyond America's borders, the results have been even worse. The greatest tragedy has occurred in Mexico. When President Felipe Calderón took office in December 2006, he launched (with Washington's encouragement and financial support) a military-led offensive against his country's powerful drug cartels. The result was an explosion of violence that has now claimed more than 50,000 lives. Yet the cartels are more powerful than ever and challenge the Mexican government's control in several parts of the country, especially along the border with the United States. Mexico's cartels have also set up shop in several Central American countries, putting that region back on Washington's security radar for the first time since the end of the Cold War. Evidence indicates that those criminal syndicates now control vast swaths of territory in Honduras and Guatemala -- perhaps as much as 40 percent of the latter country. Drug violence and intimidation is also beginning to spill over Mexico's border with the United States. Ranchers in southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas report increasing encounters with heavily armed cartel enforcers, and some ranch workers openly express fear about working on lands anywhere near the border. The reason the Mexican cartels exercise such worrisome clout is because they have vast financial resources at their disposal. By most estimates they control at least $35 billion a year of a $300 billion a year industry. Because drugs are illegal, the cartels enjoy a huge black-market premium. As much as 90 percent of the retail price of illegal drugs is a result of that illegality. Albert Einstein defined insanity as doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. After waging a futile war on drugs for more than four decades, while causing horrific unintended consequences both here and abroad, it is well past time to try a different approach. The core of a new strategy should be to de-fund the Mexican drug cartels. The only way to do that is to eliminate the lucrative black-market premium. And that means abandoning the failed prohibition model. Prohibition didn't work against alcohol in the 1920s, and it's not working any better today against marijuana and other illegal drugs. The saddest part of the silence about the drug war in the presidential campaign is that foreign leaders and the American people seem ready for a serious debate about the issue. Numerous foreign leaders, including two former presidents of Mexico, Ernesto Zedillo and Vicente Fox, and former president Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, have denounced the war on drugs. And their ranks continue to grow, as other countries grow weary and frustrated at Washington's demands that they accomplish the impossible and shut off the flow of drugs into the United States. Domestically, change is in the wind as well. A 2011 Gallup survey showed that 50 percent of Americans were in favor of legalizing marijuana -- by far the largest percentage since the surveys began in the 1970s. Furthermore, solid majorities (some 57 percent) of both Democrats and Independents endorsed legalization. Indeed, the only demographic sector in the survey that firmly embraced prohibition consisted of people over 65. The mortality tables alone indicate that sentiment in favor of legalization is likely to prevail within the next decade or so. In short, a presidential candidate who is bold enough to advocate a reassessment of the war on drugs is likely to score both diplomatic points abroad and political points at home. Challenging the conventional wisdom would, of course, require political courage. But that is supposedly a quality we seek in a president. Governor Romney and President Obama have a prime opportunity to demonstrate that they possess that quality</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1346775178399</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 12:12:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346775342782-64</Id><Topic><Title>MAGOO is unconvinced a ROMNEY PRESIDENCY would help restore the middle class &amp; jobs to America!</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1346760582130</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 08:09:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does anybody here care what Magoo thinks?lol He's the unfunny joke of the board.</Msg><Username>crankf41</Username><Timestamp>1346775342782</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 12:15:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346775346746-65</Id><Topic><Title>MAGOO is unconvinced a ROMNEY PRESIDENCY would help restore the middle class &amp; jobs to America!</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1346760582130</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 08:09:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Didn't you say the middle class is in trouble and there are no jobs?

Mitt Romney began Bain Capital to launder money during Iran-Contra drugs for weapons scandal, and the Iran-Iraq War during the Reagan presidency; initial seed money came from elite El Savadoran families (eg Francisco, Orlando, Herbert de Sola) in Miami funding Death Squads in El Savador guarding the Cocaine pipeline. Iran and Iraq WMD’s were delivered under the table using these profits; Bain made 175% per year for 10 years, only possible through drugs like Cocaine and its highly profitable Crack derivative (Gary Webb’s expose’ in the San Jose Mercury News can be researched for details) or Heroin. After the Iran-Iraq genocide, these WMD’s were used as a pretext for George Bush Sr’s Gulf War I invasion. These same WMD’s were later used as the main pretext for George Bush Jr’s Gulf War II. Saddam’s WMD’s were in fact US WMD’s because Saddam and George Bush Sr are both business investors in Carlyle Group as well as 330 Freemasons. Iraq’s WMD’s were shipped to Syria ahead of Gulf War II and will be used as the pretext for World War III, set to begin in Syria and Iran.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1346777245013</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 12:47:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346777307716-79</Id><Topic><Title>FOOD STAMP USE CLIMBS TO OVER 47 MILLION!</Title><Username>downgoesobama</Username><Timestamp>1346776830251</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 12:40:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How can things be better if there are a RECORD number of people on food stamps and a record number of people on some form of government support.

In 2008, President Obama became the first Democrat in more than 40 years to win the state, and head-to-head polls this time around have shown Romney and Obama close to tied. Most surveys of the contest have not included any third-party candidates, but Public Policy Polling — which uses automated phone calls rather than live interviews — released Virginia polls in May and July with Goode getting 5 and 9 percent, respectively. Goode has said that he expects to take votes from both Obama and Romney, but his support is more likely to come from the GOP side. He is running on a mostly conservative platform, with a heavy emphasis on stemming both illegal and legal immigration. Goode also opposes abortion and free trade agreements.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346783975860</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:39:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346783982550-140</Id><Topic><Title>anyone who paid taxes</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346783218064</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:26:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, that's wishful thinking on your part, and explains in large part why Pubs take over in November...now after 4 years of Republican/Tea Party rule, there are still 25 million people less working, you can blame the Republicans..but the fact is..Obimbo is doing a really bad job helping America.....PUTTING 50 MILLION PEOPLE ON FOOD STAMPS IS NOT A VICTORY FOR AMERICA..IT IS A DEFEAT and will translate into one in November...CAN YOU SAY 'BUH BYE'!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1346783982550</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:39:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346784098907-141</Id><Topic><Title>anyone who paid taxes</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346783218064</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:26:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry BOYsurfer, your lies not working here.

Hell, Yes. September 4th, 2012 1:01 am Joe Conason As the Democratic convention opens today in Charlotte, the question posed by Republican counter-programming sounds simple: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” It isn’t the right question and it is intended to swindle voters. But there is still a correct answer, which raises the subject Republicans prefer not to discuss in this election. “Yes, we’re better off — if only because George W. Bush is no longer president.” Four years ago, the U.S. economy was dropping rapidly with no bottom in sight, owing to the irresponsible and incompetent policies pursued by Bush. Most Americans – indeed, many people around the world – were deeply frightened by the financial crisis. We were losing 750,000 jobs a month and seemed to be sinking into a global depression. By February 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen to around 6500. Today the economy is returning to growth, slowly but steadily. The stimulus and other Obama policies prevented far worse consequences that we might have faced without them, inadequate as they were to improve employment rapidly. Nevertheless, the U.S. economy has gained about four million jobs since Obama assumed office, while the Dow is around 13,000, or roughly double its three-year low. America and the world still confront serious economic dangers — principally from the fiscal austerity that conservatives have imposed in Europe and would implement here – but we now have at least begun to emerge from the crisis. To ask whether we are better off today is a misleading question, however. Given the economic conditions that Obama inherited – including a severe recession, a ruined banking system, and a burst housing bubble – there is no truthful economist who would predict that most households would be “better off” after only three years of recovery. The more honest question is whether we are better off today than we would be if Bush – or Mitt Romney, who has offered his own critique of Obama’s actions – had been in power during those years. Again, the answer is plain. There is absolutely no reason to believe that Bush, a rigid, simplistic right-wing ideologue, would have been adequate to deal with the crisis. Having reluctantly gone along with the Troubled Assets Relief Program to bail out the big banks, would he have implemented any stimulus spending as the recession grew worse in 2009? What would he have done about the failing auto industry? As for Mitt Romney, we know what he would have done – which is nothing — because he has told us so. No stimulus and no assistance to the auto industry, which would have meant the loss of millions more jobs and a freefall into depression; more tax cuts and more cuts in public services, which would have also have meant more jobs lost by teachers, firefighters, and cops. So are we better off today than we might have been? The answer should be obvious. But in comparing Obama and Romney there are different and more pressing questions. Which candidate has showed better judgment – and which candidate would handle a renewed crisis more capably? Those are the issues that the coming campaign must explore.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1346784814947</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:53:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346784878515-145</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT IS THE DEMOCRATIC SOLUTION TO THE DRUG WAR?</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1346784337666</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:45:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So the first time that a liquor store got broken in after prohibition, we should have brought prohibition back into law ?

In his acceptance speech, Mr. Romney tossed out his five policy ideas almost as an afterthought. Energy got one sentence, education scored big with two. Neil Armstrong received almost as much speech time as what Mr. Romney would do specifically to spur faster growth and raise middle-class incomes. The WSJ warned that if Romney doesn't define his own policies, Democrats will do it for him. "We wouldn't be surprised to see them pivot away from personal attacks on Mr. Romney and Bain next week and devote all of their time to assailing his policies," the editorial staff wrote. Democrats "will have a blank canvass on which to paint because Mr. Romney did so little to explain what he would do and how it would help improve the economy." This isn't the first time Romney has been criticized for being nonspecific. Earlier this week, an opinion piece in U.S. News &amp; World Report said that the convention speech was "was too vague and impersonal to be helpful to Governor Romney." Conservative columnist Bill Kristol told Fox News Sunday in July that "I don’t think you can beat an incumbent president, even if the economy is slow, if 72 percent of the voters think you as the challenger don’t have a clear plan for improving the economy."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346791364337</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 16:42:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346793929221-171</Id><Topic><Title>Ya bet your Butt we're better off</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1346784814947</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 14:53:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WOW talk about bending the truth or just flat out lying.

In voting against the bill, Republicans raised both substantive and procedural problems with the measure. The bill fell four votes short of the 60 needed to bring it to debate, with 42 voting against it. Four GOP senators -- Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine and Dean Heller of Nevada -- voted in favor of the bill. Romney drives a truck through Obama's 'build that' remark Boehner: Obama 'doesn't give a damn' Obama: Big money no match for Americans Sen. Johnson: Obama 'doesn't have a clue' Obama: Romney will create jobs overseas With job creation the top issue this campaign season, and outsourcing being blamed as a big contributor to the high unemployment rate, Democrats saw the bill as an election-year winner. Sponsored by Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, who is running for reelection, the bill made it to the top of the "to-do list" for Congress President Barack Obama unveiled earlier this year. The Bring Jobs Home Act would provide a 20% tax break for the costs of moving jobs back to the United States and would rescind business expense deductions available to companies that are associated with the cost of moving operations overseas.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346797322589</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 18:22:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346798202219-176</Id><Topic><Title>GOP and the Obvious Lack of ANY Diversity</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1346787155264</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 15:32:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney's country is for white men only.

You might recall that John Hinckley was a seriously deranged young man who shot President Reagan in the early 1980's. Hinckley was absolutely obsessed with movie star Jodie Foster, and, in his twisted mind, loved Jodie to the point that to make himself well known to her, he attempted to assassinate President Reagan. There is speculation Hinckley may soon be released as having been rehabilitated. Consequently, you will appreciate the following letter from Nancy Reagan to John Hinckley: To: John Hinckley From: Mrs. Nancy Reagan My family and I wanted to drop you a short note to tell you how pleased we are with the great strides you are making in your recovery. In our country's spirit of understanding and forgiveness, we want you to know that we bear no grudge against you for shooting Ronnie. We are fully aware that mental stress and pain could have driven you to such an act of desperation. We're confident that you will soon make a complete recovery and return to your family to join the world again as a healthy and productive man. Best wishes, Nancy Reagan &amp; Family P.S. While you have been incarcerated, Barack Obama has been banging Jodie Foster like a screen door in a tornado. You might want to look into that.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1346799002673</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 18:50:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346800483800-183</Id><Topic><Title>Jobs going of shore has to do with WTO and NAFTA and Congress makes those agreements.

The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those wh...o are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION! Remember that day...? January 3rd, 2007 was the day Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!! And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself and a Democratic Congress.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1346812908551</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 22:41:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346813334304-298</Id><Title>Obama is a community organizer who believes America is his community.
