The bottom line is that Bush and Obama have continued an American tradition that’s been the norm my entire lifetime: spending without regard to revenues. Bush wanted to cut taxes while funding two wars and a domestic legacy. Obama wanted to create an even bigger domestic legacy–a major move towards universal healthcare coverage–while ramping up a war and stimulating the economy. The key difference is that Obama’s preference was to also raise taxes–albeit only on top earners–to help pay for it; Congressional Republicans blocked that effort."</Msg><Username>jellopuppet</Username><Timestamp>1346818408427</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 00:13:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346821858795-4</Id><Title>NOBODY SHOULD GO BROKE BECAUSE OF AN ILLNESS</Title><Msg>Well put First Lady</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346821858795</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 01:10:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346822351994-5</Id><Title>"IS NOT ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE...</Title><Msg>IT'S ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE YOU MAKE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES" Michelle Obama "Wooooooohhhoooooo hello ladies, want to go to Norstrom with me ?"

So the heated debate over Obamacare is intentionally mischaracterized as a "government takeover of health care" despite that there's no public option for health insurance, let alone a single payer. Whatever its many flaws, the individual mandate was a plan initially put forward by the conservative Heritage Foundation, proposed by Republicans as an alternative to "Hillary Care" in the 1990s. It was implemented in his state by Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who argued it advanced the virtue of personal responsibility. But "government takeover of health care" polls better, and so it is repeated in the echo chamber until facts start to fade. This is the Politics of the Empty Chair. In the Politics of the Empty Chair, when a bipartisan group such as the Tax Policy Center criticizes primary opponent Rick Perry's tax plan, Romney holds up their analysis as impartial. But when they scrutinize his tax plan and find that it would actually raise taxes on middle class households by removing tax credits and deductions to pay for additional tax cuts for upper-income voters, it is attacked as blatantly partisan, not fit for decent conversation.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346858884123</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:28:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346858997318-39</Id><Title>obama moves speech</Title><Msg>to smaller place. hahahaha he cant fill his hall...guess where. that evil bank of america. dopey says it because weather hahahahahahahahaha. he is toast. manchelle said a whole lot of nothing last night. she should thank the rich for paying her and obamas grants. opsie she forgot to mention that.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346858997318</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:29:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346859943575-40</Id><Topic><Title>I don't want a Mormon in the White House</Title><Username>malachie24</Username><Timestamp>1346817554772</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 23:59:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can't trust a man who believes the earth is 6000 years old and that Jesus lived in America</Msg><Username>billclauson</Username><Timestamp>1346859943575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:45:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346859963733-41</Id><Topic><Title>obama moves speech</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346858997318</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:29:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>right just like they "evolve" and not flip flop...hahahahahaha obama toast. good luck this november.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346859963733</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:46:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346860028165-42</Id><Topic><Title>obama moves speech</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346858997318</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 11:29:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They had originally scheduled his speech in a stadium that held 74,000.

Here's a quick look into the three former Fannie Mae executives who brought down Wall Street. Franklin Raines - was a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Fannie Mae. Raines was forced to retire from his position with Fannie Mae when auditing discovered severe irregularities in Fannie Mae's accounting activities. Raines left with a "golden parachute valued at $240 Million in benefits. The Government filed suit against Raines when the depth of the accounting scandal became clear. Tim Howard - was the Chief Financial Officer of Fannie Mae. Howard "was a strong internal proponent of using accounting strategies that would ensure a "stable pattern of earnings" at Fannie. Investigations by federal regulators and the company's board of directors since concluded that management did manipulate 1998 earnings to trigger bonuses. Raines and Howard resigned under pressure in late 2004. Howard's Golden Parachute was estimated at $20 Million! Jim Johnson - A former executive at Lehman Brothers and who was later forced from his position as Fannie Mae CEO. Investigators found that Fannie Mae had hidden a substantial amount of Johnson's 1998 compensation from the public, reporting that it was between $6 million and $7 million when it fact it was $21 million." Johnson is currently under investigation for taking illegal loans from Countrywide while serving as CEO of Fannie Mae. Johnson's Golden Parachute was estimated at $28 Million. WHERE ARE THEY NOW? FRANKLIN RAINES? Raines works for the Obama Campaign as his Chief Economic Advisor. TIM HOWARD? Howard is a Chief Economic Advisor to Obama under Franklin Raines. JIM JOHNSON? Johnson was hired as a Senior Obama Finance Advisor and was selected to run Obama's Vice Presidential Search Committee.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346861578585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 12:12:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346861651349-47</Id><Topic><Title>WMD- WEAPONS OF MASS DISTRACTION</Title><Username>franklincarter95</Username><Timestamp>1346848963054</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 08:42:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you need to start a new movement!@!! ;)</Msg><Username>jimtalkner</Username><Timestamp>1346861651349</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 12:14:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346861724787-48</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA is FOS</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346861578585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 12:12:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would agree and also that MITT IS FUL OF SH$#!

The day the Democrats took over was NOT January 20, 2009, it was actually January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took over the House of Representatives and the Senate, at the very start of the 110th Congress. The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those wh...o are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION! Remember that day...? January 3rd, 2007 was the day Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!! And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself and a Democratic Congress.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1346868339972</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:05:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346868715176-74</Id><Topic><Title>WILL IMPEACHED BILLY CLINTON GIVE US A RAPE PLAY BY PLAY TONIGHT?</Title><Username>deepscrotum</Username><Timestamp>1346863200339</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 12:40:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes and VP Gore was very fond of female massage therapist.

Romney believe we should go back to the top-down economic policies of the last decade. He thinks that if we simply eliminate protections for families and consumers, let Wall Street write its own rules again, and cut taxes for the wealthiest, the market will solve all our problems on its own. Romney/Ryan argue that if we help corporations and wealthy investors maximize their profits by whatever means necessary, whether through layoffs or outsourcing, it will automatically translate into jobs and prosperity that benefits us all. They would repeal health reform, turn Medicare into a voucher program, and follow the same path of fiscal irresponsibility of the past administration — giving trillions of dollars in tax cuts weighted towards millionaires and billionaires while sticking the middle class with the bill. But we've tried their policies — and we've all suffered when they failed. We can't go backward, we must move forward.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo24</Username><Timestamp>1346868913807</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:15:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346868966437-76</Id><Topic><Title>trickle-down economics, student vouchers, privatizing social security, war with IRAQ</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo24</Username><Timestamp>1346866251435</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 13:30:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL only in the GOP is the President not responsible, Hey Capgail guess there is nothing to blame Obama for then, it's all the House GOP fault right? Bush's own staff says your wrong. From his earliest days in office, Mr. Bush paired his belief that Americans do best when they own their own home with his conviction that markets do best when let alone. He pushed hard to expand homeownership, especially among minorities, an initiative that dovetailed with his ambition to expand the Republican tent — and with the business interests of some of his biggest donors. But his housing policies and hands-off approach to regulation encouraged lax lending standards. As early as 2006, top advisers to Mr. Bush dismissed warnings from people inside and outside the White House that housing prices were inflated and that a foreclosure crisis was looming. And when the economy deteriorated, Mr. Bush and his team misdiagnosed the reasons and scope of the downturn; as recently as February, for example, Mr. Bush was still calling it a “rough patch.” The result was a series of piecemeal policy prescriptions that lagged behind the escalating crisis. “There is no question we did not recognize the severity of the problems,” said Al Hubbard, Mr. Bush’s former chief economics adviser, who left the White House in December 2007. “Had we, we would have attacked them.” Looking back, Keith B. Hennessey, Mr. Bush’s current chief economics adviser, says he and his colleagues did the best they could “with the information we had at the time.” But Mr. Hennessey did say he regretted that the administration did not pay more heed to the dangers of easy lending practices. And both Mr. Paulson and his predecessor, John W. Snow, say the housing push went too far. “The Bush administration took a lot of pride that homeownership had reached historic highs,” Mr. Snow said in an interview. “But what we forgot in the process was that it has to be done in the context of people being able to afford their house. We now realize there was a high cost.” For much of the Bush presidency, the White House was preoccupied by terrorism and war; on the economic front, its pressing concerns were cutting taxes and privatizing Social Security. The housing market was a bright spot: ever-rising home values kept the economy humming, as owners drew down on their equity to buy consumer goods and pack their children off to college. Lawrence B. Lindsey, Mr. Bush’s first chief economics adviser, said there was little impetus to raise alarms about the proliferation of easy credit that was helping Mr. Bush meet housing goals. “No one wanted to stop that bubble,” Mr. Lindsey said. “It would have conflicted with the president’s own policies.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346868966437</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:16:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346869387572-77</Id><Title>Like an old friend from years ago; here comes an 18 handle</Title><Msg>don't you know! $18 forever and even in 50 years 18 dollars here it is......flat as pancake......as dull as John Chambers on the macro environment</Msg><Username>scott4usa</Username><Timestamp>1346869387572</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:23:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346869806390-78</Id><Topic><Title>16 trillion nat debt.</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346865492990</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 13:18:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dont worry obama will just change the way we record unemployment caculations. old dem trick, if the numbers dont look good turn them up side down.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346869806390</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:30:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346870168841-79</Id><Topic><Title>trickle-down economics, student vouchers, privatizing social security, war with IRAQ</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo24</Username><Timestamp>1346866251435</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 13:30:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for showing us why Barney Franks is picking up his marbles and going home!

I’m a gay man, I got married to my husband Brad, and I don’t particularly like being told my marriage should be invalidated because I don’t have the same rights as other people. But mind you, I don’t forget that it was a Democratic President (FDR) who abused his power 70 years ago and put my family and me in an internment camp without charge, trial or cause. Now that was Big Government at its very worst. So I am leery of excessive government power or control of any kind. That’s why I want to take a moment here to talk about the 800 pound gorilla in the room: To ask why the GOP has allowed itself to be hijacked by extremists who aren’t Republican at all. At their core, Republicans are for smaller government. That means LESS governmental intrusion into our lives, our affairs, our money. Consistently applied, this is a sound and important philosophy that acts as a counterweight to wasteful government spending, excessive taxation, and Big Brother intrusiveness. It is a “live and let live” attitude. Good people may disagree respectfully whether more or less government is needed in areas such as healthcare and education, whether a larger military or more international intervention is needed, and whether we should cut taxes on the wealthy or raise them. I personally can completely understand the economic rationales behind the GOP platform, even if I don’t think we should retry them right now. What I simply can’t understand is why the GOP ignores the gorilla in their tent when it comes to social issues. For a party that prides itself on less government intrusion, it sure seems busy these days telling women and LGBT persons what they can and cannot do. This is not only inconsistent, it is a poor strategy for keeping the party strong, growing, and current. If religious fundamentalists want to push their extremist agendas, they should do it in some other party, so that I don’t have sit there in awkward conversations with my Republican friends, secretly wondering how they can continue to pander to such drivel.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346884671152</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 18:37:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346884689777-189</Id><Topic><Title>JAPANESE GUY HAS A POINT...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346884671152</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 18:37:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would be as if the Democrats suddenly had its ranked filled by hard-core Communists who steadily called upon the total abolishment of private business.

It was a stunning development. The party had dropped the assertion that Jerusalem was the capital of the Jewish state, but on Wednesday evening the Democrats had a change of heart. The vote went down just before 6 p.m. and it was quite contentious on the floor. It needed a two-thirds majority and it took three votes to get it, CBS 2’s Marcia Kramer reported. And even after the vote, many thought the crowd of delegates on the floor was split 50-50, rather than delivering the two-thirds majority needed. The Democrats caved, changing the platform language to reflect that they now regard Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. It came about as a result of intense political pressure,” CBS 2’s Kramer reported. “I think it is a mistake and I’m not happy about it,” Rep. Jerrold Nadler said of the original language. “I disagree with that platform,” Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand added. “We try to avoid this type of conflict by providing ammunition to the other side to exploit,” Rep. Nydia Velazquez said. President Barack Obama handed the Republicans a new avenue of attack on a silver platter when he supported a Democratic Party platform change that does not state that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. It was a dramatic change from what the president said when he was running for office the first time. “Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel and it must remain undivided,” he said back in 2008. The omission in a platform that does support strong security assurances for Israel left Democratic officials saying it was a mistake, but “I would very much have preferred that plank to be in there,” New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said. “That said, I think President Obama’s record on Israel is strong. It is a record of commitment to Israel.” Jewish leaders reacted swiftly. “The principle that Jerusalem should remain united and is the capital of Israel has been enshrined for a long time,” said Malcolm Hoenlein, the Executive Vice Chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. “It concerns me. It concerns every Jew,” said Chanina Sperlin, Executive VP of the Crown Heights Council. “It’s a big mistake leaving that out of the party platform.” Many Palestinians were also annoyed. They want Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state. “The debate surrounding this, it’s not so much about the peace process and a peaceful solution in the Middle East, but it’s more about scoring points, whether you’re a Democrat or Republican, and that’s unfortunate,” said Muneer Awad from the Council on American-Islamic Relations. The omission gave Republicans an opening. Presidential nominee Mitt Romney called it “shameful,” because Jewish voters in battleground states like Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Nevada could be critical. “It’s mystifying that the Democrats would do this at a time when they are trying to repair relations with the Jewish community,” Hofstra University professor Larry Levy said. “Jewish voters have been concerned over whether the Obama administration has been playing fair in the Middle East The flip flop was explained away by campaign officials saying the change was done to “reflect the president’s personal point of view.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1346887216069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 19:20:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346887439587-204</Id><Topic><Title>DNC puts Jerusalem back in platform</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1346884880830</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 18:41:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is the moment that Obama has lost this election.

Its illegal to take foreign money, but the FEC didn't ask for a full accounting of all contribution from Obama, McCain took public funding and the law made him give a full accounting. Obama didn't give a full accounting, because he didn't have any limits because he didn't take public funding. On Romney, most of us know the IRS from personal experience has gone after people for $100. If Romney owed them money he would have been audited. If you don't file every year the IRS will force you to account for your earnings, and deductions. This is just stupid, there is no law saying Romney must provide the Dems with more than the couple of years of taxes that he has already provided. Romney has no income from salary, he has been retired for years and years, and his taxes are the result of Cap Gains taxes on money that was previously taxed before he invested it. He like all of us is being double taxed and when he dies he will be triple taxed. Then they will tax his heirs too.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1346889406028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 19:56:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346889408921-216</Id><Title>Swiss Bank accounts, OUTSOURCED JOBS, businesses in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. $10,000 bets.

Sure enough a few years later he died, at his funeral the wife showed up and just before they closed the coffin she walked up and put a box into the coffin. I was shocked and asked her if she really was going to put all that money in the coffin to be buried? She said she had promised her husband that she would and she would never lie.

That was the case in ‘mo mecca Ybor City where the gay republicans let their weaves down at The Honey Pot for the third annual Homocon. Featuring the requisite go-go boys bafflingly wearing shirts – but we guess it wasn’t that kind of party — touting “Freedom Is Fabulous,” the event was organized by the conservative queens at GOProud and attended by Republicans of both the Log Cabin and regular, humdrum cabin constituencies. Of course no event involving the gays and the Republicans would be complete without some religious protesters, but they’re really not known for their ability to party and were long gone by the time Homocon rolled out of the gutter at 3 a.m. Highlighting the economy in his address to the crowd, GOProud co-founder and executive director Jimmy LSalvia quipped, “As most of you know I support civil marriage for gay couples. And marriage is important. But before you get married, you need a date, and everybody knows you can’t get a date without a job.” And who said politics couldn’t be funny? Because they really hit it on the nose with that one. All in all, the event saw some 500 attendees, many who were given disco ball key chains as departing gifts…adding to the collections of everyone there. Since 3 a.m. is still relatively early on the conservative dance party circuit, we wonder if any of Homocon’s attendees went for a free nightcap at the nearby Ybor Spa &amp; Resort? Let’s put that #$%$ back in Homocon, kids.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346895811073</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 21:43:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346895915076-266</Id><Topic><Title>GAY CONSERVATIVES WENT TO ANOTHER PARTY...LMAO !</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346895811073</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 21:43:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you always seem to focus on the gays surfnpee?
