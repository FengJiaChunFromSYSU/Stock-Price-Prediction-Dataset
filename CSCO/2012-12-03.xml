Before I get into the post — I’ve interacted with Sanjit from Meraki on a number of occasions and have tremendous respect for him – he’s build a great company with a fantastic group of folks – and congrats to him and the Meraki team. For those of you who don’t know – I was the founder and CEO of Pareto Networks which was acquired by Meraki competitor, Aerohive, in 2011 for our cloud networking capabilities (see YouTube video for details). Pareto also danced with Cisco, so I have an appreciation of where they are likely coming from. Additionally, at Wiretap, we’ve advised a number of public and private companies on cloud networking in the last 12 months – specifically around WiFi, campus, and branch networking. Meraki: A smart buy and smart exit For Cisco, Meraki is a smart buy. It allows Cisco to: Accelerate revenue growth into their WLAN business Upgrade the old, unmanaged Aironet AP business that still likely brings in $200M-$300M in annual revenue. And more importantly, protect that revenue stream – which based our understanding, was primarily in the mid-market that Meraki, Aerohive, Xirrus, and others are going after. Gain a Cloud-Networking Platform that enables them to create and sell new networking services to small / medium business as an ongoing service. Meraki was more than WiFi – as they also have an interesting (and free) mobile device management (MDM) solution For Meraki, Cisco is a smart exit for a number of reasons: Our understanding is that Meraki had a relatively low average deal size (sub $10k) which means you need to turn a significant number of deal every quarter to make your number. This is even more pronounced once you are a public company Gains enterprise class access points. What we heard from customers and channels were limitations in Meraki’s commodity WiFi radios, which created deployment problems in non-standard buildings. Cisco’s WiFi and radio chops will solve this. One open question is how does Meraki’s technology, which overlaps with not only existing WiFi products, but also ASA firewalls, and ISR routers become integrated within Cisco’s portfolio. Who wins from this deal: Aerohive: Meraki will be distracted for a few quarters integrating into Cisco. This should help Aerohive accelerate their IPO plans. Other private and small cap public WIFI vendors (Ruckus, Meru, Xirrus, etc) investing in Cloud-based networking. We’ve heard that just about every major networking company with a presence in campus, branch, or network security is looking to build or acquire a cloud-networking capabilities. Unfortunately, there are not that many of them to be acquired. Who loses from this deal: Aruba: This is a direct assault on Aruba’s new target area for growth for their new cloud based WiFi solution. Given the Aruba and Meraki shared a board member – this had to create some awkward discussions. Mobile Iron: A common assumption in Silicon Valley was the Cisco would acquire Mobile Iron for MDM (it was after all, the Airspace team from Cisco’s last major WiFi acquisition). Now that Cisco has a free MDM solution, it’s doubtful they need to invest in Mobile Iron. Any cloud-networking company that lacks a WiFi component to their solution. WiFi has become the anchor for campus and branch networking. Many customer segments we speak with are increasingly willing to trust managing their campus and branch networks to cloud-based management solution. A decision we made at Pareto to initially focus on branch routers / security and not WIFI proved a revenue scale challenge. We quickly learned that you sell roughly 10X access points to every branch router and that the economic buyer often would base a large part of their decision on WiFi capabilities. Is Meraki SDN? Does Meraki extends Cisco’s SDN strategy to WiFi? SDNCentral’s definition of Software-defined Networking (n) is: a new approach to networking that allow network operators more control of their infrastructure, allowing customization and optimization that enables invention of and delivery of new types of network services. Based on this definition, Cloud Networking and therefore, Meraki, aren’t exactly SDN since they offer network operators little customization or optimization. However the value proposition of agility, flexibility, speed to turn up new services are similar to many benefits of SDN. In addition, WiFi has long operated under an ‘controller-based’ architecture. Legacy controller architectures, such as those from Trapeze (Juniper), Airespace, and Aruba, that required the data and control traffic to run though a controller are far removed from SDN. Newer ‘controller-less’ or cloud-controller architectures, such as Meraki and Aerohive are essentially controller architectures that do not require data traffic to travel through the controller – and are very SDN-like. Given our experience working with clients to design and develop cloud-networking platforms and SDN applications — there are more similarities than differences between the two technologies. For example, both SDN solutions and cloud-networking from Aerohive and Meraki offer APIs (some open, some closed) that enable programming of the data plane. On the flip side, in SDN, the packet forwarding decisions are made within an SDN application (sometimes a controller) while in cloud-networking packet forwarding decisions are made by the network device under direction of a cloud controller. So while I wouldn’t label Meraki an SDN company, nothing prevents Cisco from enhancing the Meraki platform to be a cloud-based SDN controller in the future. Based on our end customer engagements, we see limited customer value for using SDN / OpenFlow to manage WiFi networks today. The beauty of the Meraki architecture (and other cloud controller based WIFI solutions) is that for the most part it ‘just works’ which is the benefit of the closed architecture (ala Apple) – and we just don’t hear customers clamoring for this to change. We think this is primarily because a) campus and branch networks are relatively static; where b) simplicity is a most desired value proposition which is generally best delivered by an integrated single vendor solution.</Msg><Username>exgeae</Username><Timestamp>1354544711834</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 09:25:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354546467218-18</Id><Topic><Title>47% PAYING ZERO INCOME TAXES IS NOT FAIR</Title><Username>black_congressional_cacas</Username><Timestamp>1354425519790</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 00:18:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(like romney for example) At least he gives a large amount to charity, Now these folks don't give and pay less taxes!

When he decides it’s finally time to return to Realityville, he knows where to find us.” Sen. McConnell denied earlier reports that he “burst out laughing” when he heard Mr. Obama’s latest budget proposal, telling reporters, “Actually, it would be more accurate to say I peed myself.” “That business about raising taxes on the rich was—pardon my French—freaking hilarious,” Sen. McConnell said. “I’m glad that losing the election hasn’t made the President lose his sense of humor.” .</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354552195520</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:29:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354552244828-42</Id><Topic><Title>World temperature set to increase 9 degrees: study</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354551724161</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:22:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Magoo usually posts his global warming stuff under his dumbivan id.

But if Speaker John Boehner and the rest of the House leadership thought choosing Rep. Candice Miller (R-MI) to lead the House administration committee — making her the sole female committee chair in the House — would put the issue to bed, they appear to have been mistaken. So, who is Candice Miller who gets to be the GOP’s Smurfette? Candice Miller picked for `war room’ duty As the nation’s war with Iraq unfolds, freshman U.S. Rep. Candice Miller may be a visible and familiar source of information. Miller, R-Mt. Clemens, is one of a group of lawmakers participating in a “war room” that will provide information from the Bush administration to other Republican members, the news media and constituents. Miller and the others are on “a short list to call” to go on radio, talk shows and talk with reporters, said Melissa Mazzella, Miller’s press secretary. National defense is a top issue for Miller. She is the sole freshman in the war room and Michigan’s only member on the House Armed Services Committee. She’s also one of two freshmen on a House GOP tax dividend working group. The group is working to push for President Bush’s proposal to make corporate dividends tax-exempt. You might also remember Miller from the Tom Delay ethics investigation: she was one of his minions that would take commands from The Bug Man when he needed to strongarm his caucus members to vote as he dictated, by using threats or bribes. She was admonished by the GOP-lead ethics panel, which must take some doing.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354553678435</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:54:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354553704076-51</Id><Title>Here's your MANDATE folks</Title><Msg>There are 3 branches of government, Democrats continue to control 2 of the 3 branches BUT there are at least 15% MORE elected Republicans than there are Democrats.

Surely Rice should have know about poor information from intelligence after campaigning for Obama, huh? "Rep. Tom Cole, a Republican from Oklahoma, says that if lawmakers are going to go after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice over her initial public assessment of the September attack in Benghazi then maybe Congress should also look at how President George W. Bush pushed bad intelligence about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq." Bush pushed bad intelligence? He clearly said that his information was gathered from intelligence sources. Some folks just can't read. Some folks just don't learn. Some might wish to re-read what Bush said. "look at how President George W. Bush pushed bad intelligence" Obviously, American intelligence sources have lost all credibility. Bush and Rice are political fodder to a failed infrastructure which the current administration has left hopelessly unchanged. Where is that hope and change?

We can spend our way out of debt, but the money has to be paid to people who know what to do with it. You can't expect to pay for idiots to go to college when those who alreadypaid their own way are not finding sufficient jobs or creating them. Spending your way out of debt means supporting those who drive revenues, not draining the system of every last dime with entitlements. Lincoln started the national college level education programs, but they weren't sending kids who couldn't read to college. They spent at a level which would only permit the best and the brightest.

In 2011, there were 21 scheduled Fridays, compared to only 15 planned for 2013. Members will work only one Friday for nine months out of the year, and two Fridays for the other three months. Both 2011 and 2013 are non-election years. But never mind the Fridays, according to the official Congressional work calendar, the House will be in session on for a whopping 127 days total in 2013. They claim one off week a month is for working in their home district visits. Which in the Republicans case is what they call appearing at ribbon cutting ceremonies where they take credit for government funded projects that they voted against funding in the first place. Then of course, there's holiday breaks and the August recess. They're facing a brutal 2 day work schedule in that month. Useful to remember while they're figuring out ways to starve granny and cut off government assistance to the poor and disabled, as Speaker of the House John Boehner's annual base salary is $223,500. And his average net worth, give or take a million or two, is $3,588,556. Fascinating list of his investments at the link.

Why are you turdoids blaming the (alleged) coming fiscal cliff on the republicans if they are so irrelevant? The white house would love nothing better than to raise everyone's taxes (for revenue) and blame the republicans for the tax increase.

Did you mention the DNC has a lock on 250 electoral seats and the GOP has a lock on 180?? Meanwhile, in a place called reality: 1. President Obama hasn't been this popular since the death of Bin Laden. 2. Republicans got shellacked November 6. This is an indisputable fact. 3. The ignorance of the Tea Party has overtaken the sincere fiscal conservatives- membership is falling. 4. Even conservative talking heads concede that the GOP is on track to lose critical swing states for years to come. 5. Not a single desperate GOP conspiracy has proven to be true. Not one. Carry on. Great post!!Wish I could give it more than one thumb up.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354587272016</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 21:14:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354587780385-203</Id><Title>hilary's last wishes.</Title><Msg>Blind China dissident urges Xi follow Myanmar path to reform china.</Msg><Username>kvbjho234</Username><Timestamp>1354587780385</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 21:23:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354587902878-204</Id><Topic><Title>It's just too funny hearing the Obbama voters in Staten Island complaining about their Messiah</Title><Username>ivanhoeofoloxly</Username><Timestamp>1354587679567</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 21:21:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is a "more on"?

How do those stats from the ever-reliable Rasmussen dispute the facts? They confirm my statement. 2. Your argument about the House is akin to a football team saying, "We let you score that touchdown, so we could get the ball back quicker." Now that is some Grade A Fox-News-type delusional spin.

Oh , let me guess "No justice no peace" right? Obama embraces those who beat the daylights out of white/hispanic men then claim no justice no peace for the criminal that beat him. Let's call up the NAACP and let Tyson take a few rounds at his nose too because there was no justice right? That's what you jack hole Democrats want to do not only to Zimmerman but to the country's financial state also.</Msg><Username>scott4usa</Username><Timestamp>1354594428959</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 23:13:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354594794276-209</Id><Title>Some skittles and a tea</Title><Msg>and beat the daylights out of a man while trying to kill him............If Obama had a little boy he'd look just like me........Momma, put up some photos of me when I'm in diapers and call Al Sharpton.
