The Eloi are the childlike, frail group, living a banal life of ease on the surface of the earth, while the Morlocks live underground, tending machinery and providing food, clothing and infrastructure for the Eloi. Each class evolved and degenerated from humans. The novel suggests that the separation of species may have been the result of a widening split between different social classes, a theme that reflects Wells's sociopolitical opinions.

Mike Crapo arrested for DUI Alexandria Police Dept. By NBC News and wire services U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo of Idaho was arrested early Sunday morning in a suburb of Washington, D.C. for driving under the influence, according to a statement released by Alexandria, Va. police. Crapo, a Republican, was stopped after a patrol officer saw his vehicle go through a red light. After failing field sobriety tests, he was arrested at 12:45 a.m. and “taken into custody without incident,” according to the statement by Alexandria police. "There was no refusal (to take sobriety tests), no accident, no injuries," Alexandria Police spokesman Jody Donaldson told The Associated Press. "Just a traffic stop that resulted in a DUI." -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In a statement Sunday night, Crapo said he was “deeply sorry.” “I made a mistake for which I apologize to my family, my Idaho constituents and any others who have put their trust in me,” he said. “I accept total responsibility and will deal with whatever penalty comes my way in this matter. I will also undertake measures to ensure that this circumstance is never repeated." Crapo (pronounced KRAY-poh) was released around 5 a.m. Sunday on an unsecured $1,000 bond. His court date is set for Jan. 4. Crapo has served in the Senate since 1998, where he has built a reputation as a staunch social and fiscal conservative. He is currently in his third term and won't have to run again until 2016. A Mormon from Idaho Falls, Idaho, he has five children with his wife, Susan.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1356360596322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 09:49:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356360655594-8</Id><Topic><Title>Run Ahead</Title><Username>onaenyeeart739</Username><Timestamp>1337084394000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-05-15 08:19:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for the free video</Msg><Username>smithmac106</Username><Timestamp>1356360655594</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 09:50:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356360932452-9</Id><Topic><Title>no wonder baggers hate education, it proves they are evil</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356304956180</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 18:22:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah I think you are right, the Eloi were gentle peaceful people, the Morlocks were monsters that were cannibals and afraid of fire.

The driver sped away, Cannon said, and the officer gave chase. The suspect turned into the driveway of a Maaco body shop at 5625 Bellaire. The Bellaire officer followed the Honda into the shop's parking lot about 8:50 a.m. The suspected gunman shot and wounded the officer. Then he fatally shot a bystander, believed to be the Maaco manager, who came outside when he heard gunshots.. Two other Bellaire officers arrived at the scene and the suspect fired on them.

As president, he praised labor unions, saying, “Collective bargaining…has played a major role in America's economic miracle. Unions represent some of the freest institutions in this land. There are few finer examples of participatory democracy to be found anywhere.” • Franklin D. Roosevelt was Reagan’s political hero and he voted for him for president 4 times. As president, he said, “F. D. R. was an American giant, a leader who shaped, inspired, and led our people through perilous times.” • As governor of California, Reagan signed into law the largest state tax increase in history up to that time. It increased California taxes by a third, including an increase in the top income tax rate. There were other tax increases as well, which raised the top rate to 11 percent from 7 percent when he took office, a 57 percent increase. • Also as governor, Reagan signed into law California’s first law permitting legal abortion – at the behest of his two most conservative advisers, Ed Meese and Lyn Nofziger. On other social issues as well, Gov. Reagan was far more progressive than his image. For example, he authorized conjugal visits for prisoners for the first time in the state and broadened environmental protection.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356379656590</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:07:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356379699569-99</Id><Topic><Title>how it works</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356375350488</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 13:55:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why so many tea party folks without the facts?</Msg><Username>teabilly_bob</Username><Timestamp>1356379699569</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:08:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356379752285-100</Id><Topic><Title>Reagan was a STATESMAN ....</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1356379386916</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:03:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>• In 1981, Reagan proposed a large tax cut. But when deficits became a problem, he supported tax increases and signed 11 of them into law. Among them was the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, the largest peacetime tax increase in American history. • Reagan supported an increase in the capital gains tax to 28 percent from 20 percent as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. • In 1986, Reagan supported an immigration reform that gave amnesty to 3 million illegal aliens. During the 1984 election, Reagan said, “I believe in the idea of amnesty for those who have put down roots and who have lived here even though sometime back they may have entered illegally.” • At the Reykjavik Summit with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986, Reagan, to the horror of his advisers, offered to abolish nuclear weapons. To their relief, Gorbachev declined the offer. For these reasons, Barack Obama has often praised Reagan. Meanwhile, Republican leaders admit that Reagan would clearly be out of step with his party and would not be able to secure its presidential nomination today. Jeb Bush is not the only one. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee: “Ronald Reagan would have a very difficult, if not impossible time being nominated in this atmosphere of the Republican Party.” Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA): Reagan “would never be elected today in my opinion.” Other Republicans note Reagan’s commitment to compromise and working with Democrats to find solutions to pressing national problems. Former chairman of the Republican National CommitteeHaley Barbour: “Let me make sure that one thing is clear about Ronald Reagan’s Republican Party: Reagan did not demand or expect everyone to agree with him on every issue. He wasn’t a purist. Some candidates are vying to be the most conservative candidate, and some voters are seeking purity in their choice. Well, in politics purity is a dead-dog loser. You need unity. And purity is the enemy of unity.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356379752285</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:09:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356379815155-101</Id><Topic><Title>Reagan was a STATESMAN ....</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1356379386916</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:03:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is a lot like Reagan, to bad the GOPERS have changed so much they won't compromise</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356379815155</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:10:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356380006441-102</Id><Topic><Title>Governments role</Title><Username>eagle1776321</Username><Timestamp>1356379581419</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:06:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You know it was a typo and even your pea brain could figure what was said.
