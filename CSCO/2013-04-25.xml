Bush Presidential Library and Museum, the first library opened by Mr. Bush, located in Guantánamo, Cuba, celebrated its eleventh anniversary in January with considerably less pomp. And for Harland Dorrinson, who curates Mr. Bush’s other library, the lack of attention stings. “We’re actually the first George W. Bush library, if anybody cares to know,” Mr. Dorrinson said, adding that “no media whatsoever” covered the Guantánamo library’s eleventh anniversary. “They say that millions of people are going to visit the George W. Bush Library in Dallas every year,” he said. “On a good day, we’re lucky if we see one or two C.I.A. guys in between interrogations, looking for a Tom Clancy novel.” While Mr. Dorrinson said that he doesn’t expect his library to get the kind of attention likely to be enjoyed by its fancier counterpart in Dallas “any time soon,” he calls the absence of recognition “hurtful.” “It seems like there was a lot of excitement about this place when we opened in 2002,” he said. “When was the last time you heard anyone in Washington even say the word ‘Guantánamo?’” That’s a shame, he added, because the library at Guantánamo has a lot to offer that the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum in Dallas doesn’t: “If you go to their Web site, you see that they’re closed some days. We’re going to be open forever.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1366918801029</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 15:40:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366920381568-65</Id><Title>OBAHBAH: "WELL, uhh uhh, I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN A RED LINE, I MEANT MORE OF</Title><Msg>a blueish yellow line, maybe sort of a light orange line but even that may not be what I meant.

"I, uh, ahhh, the good people of this nation, uh, will each receive, in the mail, not on their INTERNETS, (he smiled as he said this, 'internets') address, but at their home address a complementary Federal issue tube, 15 grams, of KY lubricant, since they are going to be reamed so badly during my second term" he smiled. "I don't believe the pain you will experience, and the loss of your financial security will be intolerable, it certainly will not be miserable for me or my family, since we will be leaving for Hawaii, again" he smiled, " soon after this ceremony. Bend over America and take it like a man" The crowd threw every thing handy at the President, including their shoes, which was eerily similar to a Bush incident in Iraq, but Obama smiled and continue his oppressive abuse of both the American population and it's lagging, sagging economy. He smile brightly for the camera's and promised that at the end of his term he will actually retire and will not seek a third term. His mansion on Maui is almost completed and he will spend winters there with his family and summer's in Guantanamo as a domestic terrorist. The amount of damage done by his Presidency now exceeds by a factor of 28 the damage done by the attack on the World Trade Center. He smiled as he entered the secure limo and returned to the airport and further luxury provided him as befits the elected President of the United States, which is rapidly becoming a third world nation.

WILL GET LARGER WITH OBAMACARE!!!</Title><Msg>you betcha baby! Of course it will get larger. Employers will pay people cash to work and their employee cost will be far lower due to excessive healthcare costs, and employees, under the table, will make and take more money home when they get paid cash...so under Democratic MISMANAGEMENT the tailspin we are in now will hit the deck and large amounts of smoke and flames will be all that's left of the 'official economy'!!! This should be an easy phenomena to measure...think about it...pick several zip codes, find out the taxes paid, the 'reported income' in those zip codes and then do an assessment of funds spent in that same zip code. Of course there are fine adjustments to make, since folks don't spend all their expendable funds in their zip code, but one could easily make a fairly accurate estimate...!!!!!! THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IS AN INDICTMENT OF THE OBIMBO ADMINISTRATION..they are loons!!!</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1366931206298</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 19:06:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366933133306-74</Id><Topic><Title>Watch Obama back down.</Title><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1366907011770</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 12:23:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama also said use of chemical weapons would be a"game changer" .

"So suggestions that our staff is larger are wrong. While every first lady approaches the job differently, the responsibilities of the office of the first lady have grown over the years to include planning and hosting hundreds of events at the White House and across the city of D.C., planning and supporting domestic and foreign travel with and without President Obama, receiving, cataloging and responding to thousands of pieces of mail, and supporting the first lady’s active schedule in support of the President -- hence the staff size for both Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Obama." The size of a first lady's staff fluctuates year to year. First ladies typically have several staff members each handling correspondence, press, social engagements and projects. At 25, Michelle Obama's staff is similar in size to her immediate predecessors. According to an Associated Press story on October 6, 2009, Laura Bush had a staff of between 24 and 26 by the end of President George W. Bush's term in 2009, citing Anita McBride, Laura Bush's chief of staff.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366939825465</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 21:30:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366939974867-95</Id><Topic><Title>USSR TOLD OBAMA BOSTON TERORIST NAME TWICE AND OBAMA LET TERORIST BOMB BOSTON</Title><Username>theory_of_evolution_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1366859868817</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 23:17:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not only did Obama let these terorists bomb Boston Marathon, Obama gave them citizenship and welfare after being warned twice by Russia and after the terorists were on two of Obama's terorist watch lists. #$%$?</Msg><Username>barack_the_kenyan_zombie</Username><Timestamp>1366939974867</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 21:32:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>27</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366940125666-96</Id><Topic><Title>WHILE TERORISTS R BLOWING UP MARATHONS OBAMA BUSY SUBVERTING 2ND AMENDMENT RIGHTS</Title><Username>harry_reid_sucks</Username><Timestamp>1366860442658</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 23:27:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>After these two moslem boston marathon terorists killed an 8 year old boy and caused hundreds of people to lose limbs, Obama was whining that he couldn't subvert the 2nd amendment.
