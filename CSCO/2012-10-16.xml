The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those wh...o are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION! Remember that day...? January 3rd, 2007 was the day Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!! And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself and a Democratic Congress. In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is: "I inherited a deficit that I voted for, and then I expanded that deficit four-fold since January 20th 2009."</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1350386089354</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 07:14:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350388170528-9</Id><Title>I think Cisco could trade above $21 next month, I would be all over it at $18</Title><Msg>by far the cheapest stock in the DOW</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1350388170528</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 07:49:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350388263577-10</Id><Title>growing 4-6%, 3% yield, p/e of 8, 30+B in cash, 70% market share, 50% of FCF returned to shareholders</Title><Msg>this is a gift at $18</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1350388263577</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 07:51:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350388356626-11</Id><Title>I'm long on America and Cisco.

"Women went into the debate actively disliking Romney, and they came out thinking he might understand their lives and might be able to get something done for them." While Lake believes Obama retains an edge among women voters, the changed views of Romney could be "a precursor to movement" to the Republican candidate, she says. "It opens them up to take a second look, and that's the danger for Obama." Even this famous Democrat pollster says Romney is ahead with women.

He is with the President on that important issue.</Title><Msg>Bloomberg Opinion (excerpt, OCT. 16, 2012)) Florida Senator Marco Rubio appeared this morning for coffee at Bloomberg View in New York and made a good impression, if you don't count his failure to identify even one tax loophole or deduction he would eliminate to help pay for a 20-percent reduction in tax rates. But he didn't make any news until he was on the way out and a bunch of reporters from other news organizations were out of earshot. Rubio was asked if he thought it was a good idea for Mitt Romney to declare China a currency manipulator on day one of his presidency, as the former governor of Massachusetts has repeatedly promised to do. "No, not really," Rubio said. "It could kick off a trade war that would be bad for the economy." As he walked away from the table, he added, "I agree with Obama on that one." Rubio is right, of course, as anyone in the business community -- including Romney -- understands. The only reason Romney hasn't been pilloried for this bit of shameless pandering is that nobody expects him to keep his promise. This view that he will back off immediately after taking the oath is simultaneously cynical and politically ignorant. Romney's promise is so specific -- and so lacking in escape hatches -- that it's a sure bet he would feel obliged to keep it.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1350413292283</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:48:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350413338439-106</Id><Topic><Title>Tonight's debate should be lame</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1350412641458</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:37:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You set the bar too high for Junior LOLOLOL Seriously.

"The idea that tax reform will jump-start an economy suffering from the after-effects of a cyclical downturn is nonsense," Bruce Bartlett wrote in a New York Times blog post on Tuesday. "There is little reason to think we will see tax reform any time soon, and even if Mr. Romney’s plan is enacted as proposed the growth effect will be small to nonexistent." Barlett noted that the economy continued to grow at roughly the same rate after Reagan's own tax reform in 1986, adding that economists agree Reagan's 1986 tax reform had little impact on economic growth. Bartlett also wrote last year that tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations did not help stimulate the economy under President George W. Bush, and that "there is no reason to believe" that the same policies would help stimulate the economy today.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350418463690</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:14:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350418647227-127</Id><Topic><Title>Tonight's debate should be lame</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1350412641458</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:37:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama wanted the town hall format to allow him to use his teleprompter, but Romney said no way.

After dodging responsibility for the Benghazi attack for over a month, pointing fingers at everything from the State Department to the intelligence community, the White House is outclassed by…Hillary Clinton. By taking the blame now, Hillary effectively 1.) Undermined Obama’s leadership, 2.) Put pressure on him right before a major debate to take the heat: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday tried to douse a political firestorm around the deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya, saying she is responsible for the security of American diplomatic outposts. “I take responsibility” for the protection of U.S. diplomats Clinton said during a visit to Peru. But she said an investigation now under way will ultimately determine what happened in the attack that left four Americans dead. … Clinton said President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are not involved in security decisions. “I want to avoid some kind of political gotcha,” she added, noting that it is close to the election. This puts Obama in an incredibly uncomfortable position. If he let’s an underling like Hillary accept responsibility, he’s going to look even weaker than he has over the past few weeks. But even if Obama does step up and take the blame for the Benghazi attack today, it might be too late. Not only will it look like he did it under political pressure, but Hillary falling on her sword just highlights the politically-craven blame-game the White House has been playing for the past month.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350420361371</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:46:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350420595591-136</Id><Title>Ryan romneyd himself into a soup kitchen</Title><Msg>LOL.

My colleague Glenn Kessler asked the Romney campaign to substantiate their claim that his policies will create 12 million jobs during his first term. The results were, as the kids say, LOL-worthy. One study said a Romney-like tax plan could create 7 million jobs. The only problem? That was over 10 years, not four years. Worse, the study assumed that a Romney-like tax plan would be completely paid for and would happen in an economy at full employment. Neither is likely. The next study was a Citigroup Global Markets effort that projected 3 million energy-related jobs. The only problems? It was over eight years, not four. Oh, and it wasn’t evaluating any of Romney’s policies at all. It was actually looking at current trends and policies — which is to say, Obama’s policies. Then there’s the 2 million jobs that a 2011 International Trade Commission report estimated we could create if China stopped violating our intellectual property rights. This study wasn’t looking at either Obama or Romney’s policies, and no one thinks that any U.S. president could get Chinese businesses to respect American patents. So Romney’s claim of 12 million jobs over four years breaks down to 7 million jobs over 10 years in an economy that’s already at full employment, 3 million jobs over eight years that have nothing to do with any of Romney’s policies, and 2 million jobs if China suddenly became very, very respectful of U.S. intellectual property laws. This is a lot of misreading studies to get to a number that’s pretty easy to reach: According to Moody’s Analytics, the economy is set to add 12 million jobs over the next four years anyway. Romney’s goal might sound ambitious, but it’s actually what we expect will happen if policy stays more or less stable over the next few years. But rather than say their goal wasn’t actually that ambitious, and they simply planned to not mess anything up, the Romney campaign tried to make it sound ambitious by misusing a bunch of studies. This isn’t the first time the Romney campaign has had some trouble getting studies to persuasively prove their point. Their recent white paper and op-ed on the economy either misquoted, selectively quoted, or misread most of the research they mentioned. In fact, it relied heavily on the work of Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff, and Reinhart and Rogoff were so concerned about the misrepresentations that they wrote a whole new paper rebutting the Romney campaign’s arguments.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350420676523</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:51:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350420890571-138</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan romneyd himself into a soup kitchen</Title><Username>ursofulofkrap</Username><Timestamp>1350420595591</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:49:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ryan pretended to help the poor, Mitt pretends he will help the middle class.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350420890571</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:54:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350421654484-139</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan's Despicable Soup Kitchen Antics A Perfect Metaphor For GOP Ticket's Disrespect For The Poor</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350419734338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Despicable?Thats too good a word for you Dumbdeepharborivan.

When demand increases manufactures increase production to meet that demand (Econ 101). In most cases this results in additional employees being hired. These newly hired employees generally use the income that they receive to buy things that they need or want thereby increasing demand for those items. This cycle repeats itself again and again thereby creating more demand and more jobs until the cycle is finally broken. This cycle was broken in 2009 when the banking crisis developed, the stock market crashed, the housing market collapsed, and hundreds of thousands of individuals lost their jobs. So the question becomes what can our country do to increase demand. Here are a few suggestions for your consideration. 1.Reduce taxes on that segment of our population that will spend the increased income that is available to them. 2. Provide additional monetary stimulus to our economy by investing in our countries infrastructure. education, research and development and in new industries that will have a long term benefit to our society. 3. Provide tax incentives to companies bringing jobs back to the United States. If you have other suggestion lets hear them.</Msg><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1350421983483</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:13:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350422471787-148</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan's Despicable Soup Kitchen Antics A Perfect Metaphor For GOP Ticket's Disrespect For The Poor</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350419734338</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You know exactly what I'm talking about,you pile of dog feces.

In August, Morello penned an op-ed for Rolling Stone that compared Ryan's musical taste to Charles Manson's appreciation for The Beatles. In that article, Morello wrote that Ryan carried a "rage against women, a rage against immigrants, a rage against workers, a rage against gays, a rage against the poor, a rage against the environment." Morello's column is a wrinkle in a well-established narrative of musicians coming out against the Mitt Romney-Paul Ryan ticket. The Silversun Pickups and Dee Snider both asked the campaign to stop playing their music. Katy Perry, Bon Jovi, Stevie Wonder and Earth Wind &amp; Fire recently performed for Barack Obama's campaign, which recently announced that Bruce Springsteen will appear with Bill Clinton at a rally in Ohio.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350423145266</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350423273672-154</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan was a jackass before he listened to [Rage Against the Machine], came out a jackass at the end, so he missed a lot of it."</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350423145266</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:32:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MORE HATRED from the far left.

Now the tone in DUmmieland is much different: ANGER at the polls and the DUmmies now questioning their accuracy. However, there is one BIG problem. A KOmmie poll released today shows Romney SURGING past Obama as you can see in this KOmmie thread, Daily Kos/SEIU State of the Nation poll: Romney's best numbers of the week.

Some business leaders are in a state of quasi-panic,” said Laurence Parisot, head of employers’ group MEDEF. “The pace of bankruptcies has accelerated over the summer. We are seeing a general loss of confidence by investors. Large foreign investors are shunning France altogether. It’s becoming really dramatic.” MEDEF, France’s equivalent of the CBI, said the threat has risen from “a storm warning to a hurricane warning”, adding that the Socialist government of François Hollande has yet to understand the “extreme gravity” of the crisis. The immediate bone of contention is Article 6 of the new tax law, which raises the top rate of capital gains tax from 34.5pc to 62.2pc. This compares with 21pc in Spain, 26.4pc in Germany and 28pc in Britain. “Let’s be clear, Article 6 is not acceptable, even if modified.

Mitt has the background, experience, intelligence and integrity to turn things around. He has my absolute support."

My model takes into account public polling, unskewing polls by party affiliation, ground game evidence, anecdotal evidence on ad buys and investment as well as demographics. Here is the map, along with my projections for percentage of vote and chance of winning. Note that percentage of vote is only the percentage of votes cast for Romney or Obama. Third parties are considered in the model but are factored out when projecting votes: State Chance R Win R Vote Share Unskew R + Ground Game + Colorado 54.8% 53.2% 0% 2.3% Florida 56.5% 54.3% 1.5% 3.1% Iowa 50.9% 50.6% 3% 1.1% Michigan 48.5% 49% -0.6% 0.5% Nevada 50.5% 50.3% 1.8% 1.2% New Hampshire 50.6% 50.4% 2% 2.1% Ohio 51.7% 51.1% 3.2% 0.9% Pennsylvania 47.5% 48.3% 1.2% -1.1% Virginia 52.3% 51.5% 4.1% 3.2% Wisconsin 48.2% 48.8% -1.1% 4.9% For note, the Obama campaign has a robust ground game, but their emphasis has been on voter registration and early voting requests. I have accounted for anecdotal early vote numbers in the model, but given that the final ground game will be determined by traditional phones called and doors knocked, the Obama campaign is at a distinct disadvantage. Also note that the “unskew” effect hurt Mitt Romney in Michigan and Wisconsin, two states where I believe the partisan affiliation samples have benefited Mitt Romney. Colorado has been the most fairly polled state in the country under this model, and Virginia has been the most misrepresented state in polling. Romney wins in this model, but it can all change based on tomorrow’s debate and polling trends over the next three weeks. If you have any questions, leave them in the comments below.
