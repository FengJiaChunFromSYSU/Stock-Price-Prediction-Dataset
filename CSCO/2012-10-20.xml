Both Romney and US President Barack Obama completed the questionnaire, which was posted on the AJC website. “I do not believe that we should be issuing public warnings that create distance between the United States and Israel,” Romney wrote. “Israel does not need public lectures about how to weigh decisions of war and peace. It needs our support.” At several points during the Obama administration, senior US officials have spoken of the dire consequences that could result from an Israeli attack on Iran. The instances, widely interpreted as a US warning for Israel not to strike Tehran, have caused tension in the relationship between the two countries. In his responses, Romney never mentions a commitment to a Palestinian state, though the AJC never asks directly whether each candidate endorses the concept. Obama, in contrast, wrote that, “The Palestinian people deserve a state of their own.” At the same time, Obama stressed that peace can only be achieved by decisions made by the parties themselves, and that unilateral steps are not the way to get there. Concerning the upheavals in the Arab world and how that would affect US aid, Obama warned that “It will be many years before the story of the Arab Spring is complete.” But while assistance to Egypt would continue during that time, he said the new government must uphold the peace treaty with Israel and transition to democracy. Romney didn’t directly answer the AJC’s question about whether aid might be affected. Instead, he wrote generally that “my administration would support groups and governments seeking to advance the values of representative government, economic opportunity and human rights and oppose any extension of Iranian or jihadist influence.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350713223876</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 02:07:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350716837609-4</Id><Topic><Title>Romney: Israel does not warrant 'public warnings'</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350713223876</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 02:07:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think Obama's warning not to cause all Hell to break loose just yet is a fair warning. Obama did get Bin Laden and dozens of top terrorists and, as he puts it, doesn't bluff when it comes to Iran obtaining nuclear capabilities. That is not an option on the table. After the election, we will have more clarity. Mitt and Benjamin go back to US Ivy League college days,so they are cozy compared to Obama. Ben might feel emboldened and ready to strike if Mitt wins and gets sworn in. Either way, Tehran isn't going to get a free pass imo. Obama has been tough on the terrorists, such as Bin Ladin and dozens of other top level operatives, and has said he doesn't bluff when he says he is unwilling to see Iran become a nuclear threat. Again, either way, I don't see Iran becoming a nuclear threat without a military strike againt it. The writing is pretty much on the wall.</Msg><Username>gordonfan4life2</Username><Timestamp>1350716837609</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 03:07:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350731191806-5</Id><Topic><Title>KOZ poll says Romney lead in NH and Iowa</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350703780506</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 23:29:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only poll that matters is INTRADE and that has Obama @ 65%.

Here is a snippet from the Chicago Tribune: (3/29/09) In a bid to get more Muslim Americans working in the Obama administration, a book with resumes of 45 of the nation’s most qualified — Ivy League grads, Fortune 500 executives and public servants, all carefully vetted — has been submitted to the White House. The effort, driven by community leaders and others, including Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), was bumped up two weeks ahead of schedule because White House officials heard about the venture, said J. Saleh Williams, program coordinator for the Congressional Muslim Staffers Association who sifted through more than 300 names.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350775189013</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 19:19:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350775304539-77</Id><Topic><Title>Find Out More Info On CSCO</Title><Username>arandall77</Username><Timestamp>1350736397581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 08:33:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>holding and if i had more cash i would be buying more.</Msg><Username>castanedadella218</Username><Timestamp>1350775304539</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 19:21:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350775487383-78</Id><Topic><Title>Cleveland Bus Driver Suspended After Decking Unruly Female Rider With Brutal Bolo Punch</Title><Username>ralph_nader_voter</Username><Timestamp>1350061993775</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:13:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm glad to see that bus driver defend himself.

How else to explain the fact that Ohio’s governor is a Republican and both branches of Ohio’s legislature are controlled by Republicans? It doesn’t matter if 100% of Ohio voters are registered Democrats if they continue to join Republicans and Independents in putting Republicans into office. And why should we expect Mitt Romney to get any fewer Democratic votes than Republican Governor Kasich got when he won the governorship?

IF what you post is really you and not just some sick practical joke, you are the epitome of the ignorant Democrap Obama base. This country is facing serious setbacks under a party that puts itself and its survival with all current players above this country. This election will be unprecedented. Keep your mind open, listen to both sides, and consult only PROven facts checkers and you will see who is telling the truth and who is a boldfaced liar.</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1350783783371</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 21:43:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350784292555-118</Id><Topic><Title>President Romney should fire Charlene Lamb for her negligence in the death of Ambassador Stevens</Title><Username>slim_whitman_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1350778228477</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 20:10:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who did the Chimpy fire for the death of Pvt Tillman?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350784292555</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 21:51:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350784563514-119</Id><Title>Voting Fraud in Ohio</Title><Msg>The Dems have started to stuff the ballot boxes in Cleveland, Toledo, Cincinnati, Columbus and Youngstown.
