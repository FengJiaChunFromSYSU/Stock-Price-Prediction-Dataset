Obama has spent 4 years HIDING everything under the sun about his past. When he opens up his personal past then by all means I would ask for Romneys. I asked for Pelosi's because it is similar in fashion to Romneys. The point your missing is, I don't have a proble with either the Romneys or the Pelosi's taking advantage of the LEGAL tax system. EVERY single American pays ONLY what they have too, it just seems that Liberals only want to point out the rich. Are you saying that you don't take every deduction you can possibly find so the check you write to the IRS is as small as possible? The ONLY difference between you, me, and Romney or even Pelosi is SCALE.

In 2009, the government gave all people with undeclared money in offshore accounts a one time amnesty for revealing those accounts. In order to get that amnesty they had to go back to 2003 and amend all of Read More... those years tax returns, and declare that money and pay taxes and penalties and interest on those accounts. It was and still is a felony to have offshore accounts that you do not reveal to the IRS and pay taxes on that money. If he had those offshore accounts all those years and had never declared them, that meant he was committing a felony, and his tax returns from 2003 to 2009 would show that they had been amended and interest and penalties paid for not declaring that money until forced to in 2009. So it appears that the Mittanic may be more afraid for it to be known that he was a felon, than for us to know that he used crafty tax laws to pay no taxes.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1344005013953</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:43:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344005486846-30</Id><Topic><Title>Who will be "Tax Gates" Deep Throat?</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1344005013953</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:43:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another conspiracy theory.

His sister, Becky Boender Ochsner, 29, who is married to a pastor, said that despite Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama’s vast differences on most issues, she saw little to distinguish them. It is “an East Coast person’s” view that a candidate is the sum of his policy positions, she said. “I think there’s more to a person and their leadership abilities, such as character,” she said. “Romney and Obama are both very arrogant and represent the political class.
