A few ideas to keep everybody honest: (1) INCOME IS INCOME (IS INCOME) - The flat tax percentage shall apply to ALL income, whether arriving in the form of hourly wages, salary, bonus, dividends, interest, short/long-term capital gains, net present value of deferred future compensation, etc. (2) MARK TO MARKET, MAYNARD - The flat tax percentage shall apply whether or not said capital gains income, etc., is "realized." Credit-back could be appropriate in cases of retracement of gains where there is no intervening realization event (though not below original basis). (3) ABUSE IT, YOU LOSE IT - Don't want to report all your sources and amounts of income accurately? No worries: If you get caught, you won't even go to jail. But you WILL forfeit the entire under-reported amount. Easy-peasy.

The entire article talks ONLY about the the Artic or North Pole. Data does show an alarming amount of melt. NO MENTION at all about the South Pole. Being a skeptic and a good steward who likes to know ALL THE FACTS I wondered why there was no mention. I go the NASA website which provided the pictures for the Artic article I mentioned above to see if any pictures were available for the South Pole. I couldn't find any, NOT SURPRISING as I figured they may CONFLICT with the narrative. I did instead find an article that said the Antactics sea ice was INCREASING and getting DEEPER. imagine my SURPRISE that the liberals with an agenda don't mention ALL the facts in the above mentioned article. Here's the really good part, these IDIOTS explain the increasing size and depth of the South Pole is caused by WARMER AIR. You can't make this stuff up folks. WARMER air is causing ice to melt in the North Pole and to expand and get deeper in the South Pole. These people have NO CREDIBILITY anymore. What a pathetic joke these tree hugging liberals are.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1348141404848</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 07:43:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348141860018-6</Id><Topic><Title>Fica is an annuity, you get the money back when you retire.</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348084438459</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 15:53:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Contrary to your statement ) Depending on your state, some people still pay state income taxes and local city/county income taxes.

Warmer air transfers a lot less heat, a lot more slowly, than does water. [NOTE - Same issues apply with Greenland in the northern hemisphere.] The Arctic, on the other hand, is just open ocean with a giant ice floe floating on the surface. (2) The situation in (1) is a key reason why sea level rise has been only modest so far. Floating ice (whether at the North Pole, or in ice shelves "attached" to Antarctica, Greenland, etc.) does not increase water level when it melts, because it already displaces an amount of water equal to its own weight (a variant of Archimedes' principle). (3) There have already been a number of dramatic collapses and retractions of millenia-old ice shelves at the edges of Antarctica, e.g. the Larsen shelf in 2002, the Wilkins shelf in 2008, etc. "In recent years, ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula and along the northern coast of Canada have experienced rapid disintegration. In March 2008, the Wilkins Ice Shelf in Antarctica retreated by more than 400 square kilometers (160 square miles). Later that summer, several ice shelves along Ellesmere Island in Northern Canada broke up in a matter of days. ... The remaining ice shelves retreated by as much as 90 percent, and several have experienced repeated collapses." (Google it.) (4) Scientists have also seen evidence of increasing melt rates INLAND on the continent of Antarctica, with increased "calving" of icebergs from off the land mass itself, increased rates/volumes of water outflow to the ocean, and areas of liquid water appearing deep beneath the ice sheet.

The oceans absorb vast quantities of radiant energy from the sun, as does the land, across a broad spectrum of visible and invisible light.

Furthermore, a given volume of water holds (and therefore can transfer) VASTLY more heat than can an equivalent volume of air. The air can come into contact with both Arctic AND Antarctic ice, but the ocean water can only come into contact with Arctic (and Antarctic floating SHELF) ice.

Failure to comply will result in a huge financial burden to the hospital and more than likely the doctor will lose his/her ability to practice medicine anywhere in the country. This board is to be established at every hospital in the country and the board members will only work eight hours a day.

I'll explain it, not for YOUR benefit (I'm quite convinced that you couldn't possibly understand it), but for the benefit of any interested passersby: (1) The atmosphere either transmits, absorbs or reflects electromagnetic energy, in varying degrees depending on its wavelength. It lets through (transmits) a lot of light in the visible spectrum, WHICH IS WHY OUR EYES ARE ADAPTED TO VISIBLE LIGHT, AND THUS ARE ABLE TO SEE (well, some of us, anyway).* (2) But "greenhouse gases" such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane are very efficient at blocking the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.** (3) So energy in the form of shorter-wavelength visible light passes through much of the atmosphere, and is absorbed at the surface, by either water or land, as the case may be. It is then RE-EMITTED at longer infrared wavelengths. (4) But as I just noted in (2), greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to a large degree BLOCK (either by absorption or by reflection) the infrared wavelengths thus emitted, preventing them from escaping back to space, and trapping that energy at and near the surface. (5) This trapped energy causes temperature to rise, HENCE GLOBAL WARMING. Your move, BOY. ------------------- * The atmosphere also lets through a fair amount of higher-energy ultraviolet, though most is blocked by the ozone layer -- ozone radicals are very effective at blocking UV, while plain old molecular nitrogen and oxygen are less so. ** These gases have greatly increased since man started to have a noticeable impact on the planet (through, e.g., deforestation, soil erosion, desertification, etc.), and especially since the Industrial Revolution,</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1348158056012</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 12:20:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348158397606-91</Id><Topic><Title>Arctic ice cap is shrinking??????????????</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1348141404848</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 07:43:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>//Fruitcup: In the early 1970's, SCIENTISTS predicted a coming mini ice age BASED on their research of data that showed a cooling trend over the previous DECADES.// {REPOST} Re: Global warming skeptic 24-Oct-11 06:10 pm Of 68 scientific studies published between 1965 and 1979 on the question of "global cooling": 10% predicted further global cooling 28% took no position on the question of global cooling 62% actually contradicted global cooling and PREDICTED GLOBAL WARMING (even way back then) Nevertheless, the media picked up the relative handful of global cooling stories and ran with them.

The year 2011 brought a record heat wave to Texas, massive floods in Bangkok and an unusually warm November in England. How much has global warming boosted the chances of events like that? Quite a lot in Texas and England, but apparently not at all in Bangkok, according to new analyses released Tuesday, July 10, 2012.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez)Enlarge Gallery FILE - In this Wednesday, Aug. 3, 2011 file photo, Texas State Park police officer … WASHINGTON (AP) — In a critical climate indicator showing an ever warming world, the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean shrank to an all-time low this year, obliterating old records. The ice cap at the North Pole measured 1.32 million square miles on Sunday. That's 18 percent smaller than the previous record of 1.61 million square miles set in 2007, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. Records go back to 1979 based on satellite tracking. "On top of that, we're smashing a record that smashed a record," said data center scientist Walt Meier. Sea ice shrank in 2007 to levels 22 percent below the previous record of 2005. Ice in the Arctic melts in summer and grows in winter, and it started growing again on Monday. In the 1980s, Meier said, summer sea ice would cover an area slightly smaller than the Lower 48 states. Now it is about half that. Man-made global warming has melted more sea ice and made it thinner over the last couple decades with it getting much more extreme this year, surprisingly so, said snow and ice data center director Mark Serreze. "Recently the loss of summer ice has accelerated and the six lowest September ice extents have all been in the past six years," Serreze said. "I think that's quite remarkable." Serreze said except for one strong storm that contributed to the ice loss, this summer melt was more from the steady effects of day-to-day global warming. But he and others say the polar regions are where the globe first sees the signs of climate change. "Arctic sea ice is one of the most sensitive of nature's thermometers," said Jason Box, an Ohio State University polar researcher. What happens in the Arctic changes climate all over the rest of the world, scientists have reported in studies. The ice in the Arctic "essentially acts like an air conditioner by keeping things cooler," Meier said. And when sea ice melts more, it's like the air conditioner isn't running efficiently, he said. Sea ice reflects more than 90 percent of the sun's heat off the Earth, but when it is replaced by the darker open ocean, more than half of the heat is absorbed into the water, Meier said. Scientists at the snow and ice data center said their computer models show an Arctic that would be essentially free of ice in the summer by 2050, but they add that current trends show ice melting faster than the computers are predicting.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo6</Username><Timestamp>1348163324144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 13:48:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348165248568-108</Id><Title>Jerry Yang</Title><Msg>Useless ewaste of air...

And after the Republican convention..there was no bounce in the polls...unbelievable. Of course the right wing talking heads said Obama's rise in the polls was a convention bounce (the one that Romney didn't get). But as each week goes by, Obama continues to pull away. And speaking of Ryan...where is he? He was such an outspoken firebrand with his budget plan...and now you wouldn't even know he is on the ticket he is so quiet. One thing for sure.

Neither Mitt Romney nor Obama had enough votes to win. There was much talk about ballot recounting, court challenges, etc., but a week-long ice fishing competition seemed the sportsmanlike way to settle things. The candidate that caught the most fish at the end of the week would win the election. After much of back and forth discussion, it was decided that the contest would take place on a remote frozen lake in northern Wisconsin. There were to be no observers present, and both men were to be sent out separately on this isolated lake and return at 5 PM with their catch for counting and verification by a team of neutral parties. At the end of the first day, Mitt Romney returned to the starting line and he had 10 fish. Soon, Obama returned and had no fish. Well, everyone assumed he was just having a bad day or something and hopefully, he would catch up the next day. At the end of the 2nd day Mitt came in with 20 fish and Obama came in again with none. That evening, the democrats got together secretly and said, "We think that Mitt Romney is a low-life, cheatin' son-of-a-gun. Tomorrow, don't bother fishing. Just spy on him and see just how he is cheating.” The next night (after Mitt returns with 50 fish), the democrats got together for the report of how the republicans were cheating. Obama said, "You are not going to believe this, he's cutting holes in the ice!"</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1348180217209</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:30:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348181281592-153</Id><Topic><Title>Squeeze play in (CSCO)</Title><Username>bernadettetqo227</Username><Timestamp>1348171563231</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 16:06:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks legit.

Also, it appeared as if the YouTube version was clipped in mid-thought. But now NBC News has obtained the rest of Obama’s comments, and it is clear his remarks were taken completely out of context. Obama is not talking about redistributing wealth at all — instead, he speaks about competition, the market place and innovation in an effort to improve government services in Chicago.
