So we are all so happy to hear that thousands of Mexicans are signing petitions asking America to outlaw guns, the same way they are outlawed in Mexico, where the rattle of automatic gunfire shatters the night every 20 minutes across that suffering, corrupt and poorly run aristocracy. Sure, seeing how abysmally gun control works in Mexico, to the detriment, of course, to all NON-GUN OWNING, LAW ABIDING CITIZENS, it sure does point out the flaws in liberal, Democratic thinking. Sure, classic liberal maneuver....simplistic solution, knee jerk, to complex problem that ALWAYS limits personal liberty to some degree. With an occasional exception, like the liberal push to legalize marijuana. I'm good with liberty and freedom....but legalizing marijuana and outlawing guns seems like the classic push towards a controlled society. "Sure take all the dope you can, but we will deny you the ability to defend yourself from tyranny" "Sure, heavily medicate, toke yourself into a deep slumber, a semi coma, while we, the wise Feds, run everything...no guns though! You might hurt someone."</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1358268382561</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 11:46:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358268400674-23</Id><Topic><Title>One smart Republican</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358267376480</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 11:29:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Colon Powell is no Republican, he's really a Democrap DISGUISED as a Republican.

Any blame for these regrettable deaths must fall on the mob, be they terrorist based or otherwise. It was certainly not any intentional act of the State Dept. that caused this tragic American loss. It's about time the GOP stops playing politics with the incident in an attempt to discredit Secy.Clinton. The public is very aware of the concern the Republican party has in facing Secy. Clinton in 2016' as a presidential candidate. Benghazi is just a smoke screen to besmirch Hilary's service to the State Dept.
