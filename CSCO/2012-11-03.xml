There’s been a total of four robberies in the past couple weeks near the campus. Police say they believe in two of the cases, a pair of teenage girls are responsible for assaulting students in an attempt to steal their cell phones. Eighteen-year-old Odessa Richmond was booked at Hennepin County Jail last weekend. The other girl’s name isn’t being released because she’s not eighteen. University of Minnesota student Katie Johnson said after her car was recently broken into in this area, she started to get crime alerts texted to her." Read full story at CBS Minnesota website.

Written by b kenneth mcgee Topics: Politics, Chris Christie Thursday, 1 November 2012 Governor Chris Christie was hung in effigy this morning at the GOP headquarters in the Nation's capital. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican Party, spared nothing in his criticism of the Governor who had given the key note speech at the GOP convention. "Benedict Arnold was a saint compared to this monster! Tokyo Rose was Mother Teresa compared to this turncoat! Judas was a regular guy in comparison to this mealy mouth son of a #$%$! Any elected official that puts his constituency before his super Pac's is a low life and a discredit to his profession." At this juncture Priebus gave a nod to a crane operator who lifted the effigy of Christie high into the air and hung him on a scaffold. As the assembled cried out in horror and dismay, the weight of the effigy was too much and the scaffold gave way forcing the entire hierarchy of the Republican Party to be buried under the weight. The Associated Press reports that there were no serious injuries when federal disaster personnel arrived on the scene and raised a banner two stories tall that read: "The truth shall set you free."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351941493134</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 07:18:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351948470566-12</Id><Topic><Title>Inscription on Obama's</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1351910747278</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 22:45:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the real inscription is One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them. that is how Obama is controlling the entire world now, LOL bagger retards believe anything</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351948470566</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 09:14:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351948542973-13</Id><Topic><Title>I POST EVERY FOX HEADLINE...</Title><Username>fluteman_qreq</Username><Timestamp>1351916938118</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 00:28:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go take your medication, FRUITLOOP.

U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled in September that lawyers who helped detainees bring habeas corpus petitions seeking release from Gitmo could continue to visit and communicate with their clients under the rules judges set. Lamberth rejected the Obama Administration's effort to cast those rules aside once the habeas cases or military commission cases and any related appeals were complete. In a blistering opinion, Lamberth noted that all the prisoners had a continuing right of access to the courts and he said the administration's move amounted to "an illegitimate exercise of Executive power." The indictment was a politically pointed one in light of the harsh criticism candidate Barack Obama leveled at President George W. Bush's administration over his assertion of unfettered executive power to prosecute the global war on terror. Obama worse than Bush.

Economist Timur Kuran coined the term to explain why totalitarian regimes usually collapse suddenly. A preference cascade happens when people discover millions of others share their doubts about the Great Leader. Massive media bias has made the term applicable here. The Barack Obama that Americans saw in the debates bears little resemblance to the heroic figure portrayed by the news media. The crowds have been enormous at Romney/Ryan events this past week. If this is the start of a preference cascade, many Democrats may drown in the undertow. In yet another fund-raising appeal on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said he and Michelle would be fine if he loses. If the president's friends are indeed buying him a $35 million mansion in Hawaii, as Chicago blogger Kevin Dujan (Hillbuzz) claims, that's certainly true. But public employee unions, crony capitalists and others who feed at the public trough have reason to panic. Underlings must wonder if there will be legal consequences for the laws they've broken. I predict an orgy of document shredding Nov. 7. The biggest losers could be "mainstream" journalists. Their blatant bias has dropped trust in the news media to an all-time low. It'll plunge further if more evidence of collusion with the administration emerges. Nobody trusts a liar.

It is 9 million jobs short of what he promised[.]"// ANALYSIS I doubt very much that Obama (or even his surrogates) said this in just the stark way it's being presented, as a take-to-the-bank promise, but can't seem to find the original quotes (if any) to which the ubiquitous RepubliCON talking point seems to allude. My searches only seem to pull up about a hundred different paraphrases of the same RepubliCON claim. But even assuming ARGUENDO that Obama DID make this claim, that would mean a difference in the U3 unemployment rate of (7.9 - 5.2)% = 2.7%. The civilian labor force currently sits at 155 million souls, almost exactly. (U3 unemployment rate (as a decimal)) = (# of unemployed souls)/(civilian labor force) - which means that - (# of unemployed souls) = (U3 unemployment rate (as a decimal)) * (civilian labor force) So the current 7.9% U3 unemployment rate means (.079)*(155 million) = 12.25 million souls, while a 5.2% U3 unemployment rate would equal (.052)*(155 million) = 8.06 million souls. BUT 12.25 MILLION - 8.06 MILLION = 4.19 MILLION, *LESS THAN HALF OF THE 9 MILLION SHORTFALL THAT ROMNEY AND THE ROMNOIDS ARE CLAIMING, AND THAT THE MEDIA KEEP REPEATING.* IN FACT, THE ONLY WAY THIS ALLEGED SHORTFALL WOULD COME *CLOSE* TO 9 MILLION IS IF ONE WERE (IN A *HUGE* BLUNDER OR SLEIGHT-OF-HAND) TO USE THE ENTIRE US POPULATION NUMBER OF ~315 MILLION, INSTEAD OF THE (CORRECT) CIVILIAN LABOR FORCE NUMBER. EVEN THEN, IT WOULD ONLY EQUAL 8.51 MILLION, HALF A MILLION SHORT OF THE CLAIM. *THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT ROMNEY/RYAN (BOTH OF WHOM CLAIM TO BE HARD NUMBERS GUYS) AND THE REST OF THE CONS APPEAR TO HAVE DONE.* SO ARE THEY IDIOTS OR GRIFTERS?

Frustrated residents, worried about plunging temperatures, said companies are not working fast enough to restore power.

"If I were the president of the United States, I sure wouldn't be flitting around the Midwest and the West," Giuliani said. "My job would be making sure this thing was followed through to the very end. Maybe the first couple of days he was keeping his eye on the ball, but we got gas lines now that are a mile long. We got bodies still being discovered, and we got a president who is playing campaigner in chief." Looting. Break-ins. Much of the worst damage from Superstorm Sandy happened in New York's less touristy outer boroughs. Some neighborhoods have been changed forever by the storm. Staten Island saw half of the city's fatalities. On Friday, residents sorted through waterlogged belongings and tried to figure out next steps. Rosemarie Caruso lives a block from the water on the eastern shore of Staten Island. She says there have been hurricanes before and all they brought was a little flooding. She figured she could ride out Sandy. "So we really thought we'd get a little water, [but] it was major, everything blowing, I mean the water had waves in it," she says. "It was like the ocean came up on land." On Monday night as the water reached their house she and her husband fled. But later that night she came back. "And that's when I saw all the boats floating in the water, hitting the cars, hitting the houses," she continues. "It was a very scary sight." On Friday, an enormous boat sat at the end of her street in a restaurant parking lot. Caruso's house is uninhabitable. There's no power. No heat. She and her husband spent the morning removing waterlogged furniture and clothes and piling them in her yard. All over Staten Island, mounds of garbage are growing on street corners and in yards. Julian Larocca hired a crew of day laborers to scrape the mud out of his neighbors' houses. Houses in this part of Staten Island can sell for millions of dollars if they're on the water. Now the ones on the water are the hardest hit. "Their houses are totally destroyed," he says.

Instead, Moore found herself and her boys -- Connor, four and Brandon, two -- caught in the full fury of the storm. Buffeted by torrential rains and winds of up to 90 miles per hour, her Ford Explorer plunged into a hole. According to the account she would later give police, Moore carried her sons to a nearby tree, gripping branches along with her boys as she tried to shelter them from the storm surge. She told police they clung together for hours, before Moore managed to make her way to a nearby property, and pleaded to be let inside. But according to her police account, rather than sheltering the desperate strangers, the occupant refused to let them enter. In desperation, Moore told police she then went to the back of the house, and tried to break in using a flower pot, but was unable to do so. As the storm raged on, her sons were swept away by floodwaters. The bodies of the boys were found near each other Thursday, about a quarter of a mile from where Moore last held them. The owner of the house would not let her in because they thought there were looters and burglars trying to break in. You can't trust nobody in Obama's America.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351961577494</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 12:52:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351961733351-100</Id><Title>Ohio going Romney</Title><Msg>Early voting tells the story in Ohio, and so does voter registration in Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County.

Those conclusions refer to Obama’s overall performance on the economy and foreign policy. When they get down to specifics on Benghazi, the anger pulses through every sentence. The official explanation for the inadequate security? This administration didn’t want to “offend the sensibilities” of the new radical Islamic regime which American and British arms had so recently helped install in Libya. The official explanation for why Obama administration officials watched the attack unfold for seven hours, refusing repeated requests to send the air support and relief forces that sat less than two hours away in Italy? Silence. An open discussion of these issues, of course, would lead to difficult questions about the wisdom of underwriting and celebrating the so-called Arab Spring revolts in the first place. While the removal of tyrants can be laudable, the results show a disturbing pattern of merely installing new tyrannies – theocracies of medieval mullahs who immediately start savaging the rights of women (including the basic right to education) and who are openly hostile to American interests.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351961951670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 12:59:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351962077802-103</Id><Title>Las Vegas newspaper rips Obama</Title><Msg>A major Las Vegas newspaper just ripped Obama for coming to Las Vegas rather than doing his job.

To return to office a narcissistic amateur who seeks to ride this nation’s economy and international esteem to oblivion, like Slim Pickens riding the nuclear bomb to its target at the end of the movie “Dr. Strangelove,” would be disastrous. Bear in mind that editorials typically come from a conference among several editors at the newspaper. One will usually draft an essay, and then it gets discussed, modified, and redrafted to find a consensus among the editorial board as to tone and direction. With Nevada in play, and Clark County one of the keys to Democratic victory, this attack from one of the state’s most important newspapers is very bad news for Obama, especially this close to Election Day.

Use of cell phones has been largely ignored. Younger and more liberal voters are much less likely to respond to a poll. Can anyone imagine a bagger not staying on the line to tell the pollster they are going to VOTE THE AMERICAN WAY!! LOL In May, the Pew Research Center released a study showing a dramatic drop in the percentage of households participating in its surveys. Pew reported that its contact rate—the percentage of households in which an adult was reached at all—had fallen to just 62 percent in 2012, down from 90 percent in 1997. Of those successfully contacted, the cooperation rate—the percentage of contacts with an adult that yielded an interview—was only 14 percent, down from 43 percent 15 years earlier. That means Pew’s overall response rate—the rate of completed interviews to the number of phone numbers dialed—was just 9 percent, one fourth of the 36 percent level from 1997. The plummeting response rate has far-reaching implications for public-opinion polling, but it is important to understand first why fewer Americans are participating in telephone surveys. Pew points to the inclusion of cell phones in its sampling as contributing to the sharp decline in response rates. Thirty-four percent of American households have only wireless telephones, according to the most recent data from the National Health Interview Survey, recorded during the second half of 2011. During the second half of 2008, at the time of the last presidential election, just 20 percent of American households were cell-phone-only. The explosion of American households without a landline phone has already changed telephone polling. Most polls risk under-sampling key groups if they rely only on random-digit dialing of landline telephones. For example, nearly six in 10 adults ages 25-29 live in cell-phone-only households, the National Health Interview Survey showed. By comparison, only 8.5 percent of Americans 65 or older live in homes with only wireless phones. Americans in cellular-only households are also more likely than those in landline households to rent their homes, be male, live at or near the poverty level, live outside the Northeast, and be Hispanic.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351967004917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 14:23:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351967027284-134</Id><Topic><Title>UNIONS OBSTRUCT OUT OF STATE NON UNION UTILITY CREWS FROM RESTORING POWER TO NJ</Title><Username>hilary_fot_herway2stage_2b_booed</Username><Timestamp>1351901314502</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 20:08:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Union slackers dont care how long people suffer.

The NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist College survey of likely voters put Obama ahead of Romney in Ohio, 51 percent to 45 percent, and in Florida, 49 percent to 47 percent. In Ohio, 52 percent of likely voters viewed Obama favorably and 45 percent viewed him unfavorably. Forty-eight percent viewed Romney unfavorably and 45 percent favorably. By 48 percent to 46 percent, they said Obama would do a better job than Romney in handling the economy. Likely voters in Florida viewed Obama positively, 50 percent to 46 percent, as well as Romney, 48 percent to 45 percent. Forty-eight percent said Romney would do a better job handling the economy, compared with 46 percent that said Obama. Three other surveys out this week also had Obama ahead in Ohio, a state without which a Republican has never won the presidency. A CNN/ORC International survey out yesterday put Obama ahead of Romney, 50 percent to 47 percent, among likely voters in Ohio. Both candidates campaigned there yesterday. Two surveys released Oct. 31 also found Obama ahead in the state. A CBS News/New York Times/Quinnipiac University poll had Obama leading, 50 percent to 45 percent, and the Ohio Poll by University of Cincinnati’s Institute for Policy Research gave Obama a two-point lead, 48 percent to 46 percent.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1351967597266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 14:33:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351967770562-143</Id><Title>OBAMA = NO LEGITIMATE BC, NO DRAFT REGISTRATION PROOF, NO COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS</Title><Msg>OBAMA = NO LEGITIMATE BC, NO DRAFT REGISTRATION PROOF, NO COLLEGE TRANSCRIPTS This guy sounds like a foreign spy or criminal.</Msg><Username>barack_the_kenyan_zombie</Username><Timestamp>1351967770562</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 14:36:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351967888392-144</Id><Title>Average UE for the last 4 Presidents</Title><Msg>George HW Bush 6.30% Bill Clinton 5.20% George W.

You just can’t.”</Title><Msg>After following the campaign and the three presidential debates in the US 2012 Presidential Election being contested by incumbent President Barack Obama and Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney — the rational and moral conclusion is that American voters should re-elect President Obama. A BBC world survey showed that except for Pakistan, all other countries surveyed preferred President Obama. For Romney to be preferred by the Pakistanis could be attributed to the shame they suffered when a US operation killed Osama Bin Laden meters away from a Pakistan military camp. There’s also a very noticeable similarity between Pakistani officials and Romney — they don’t always tell the truth. How many times have Pakistani officials assured us that they’ll neutralize terrorist havens in their country? That has not happened. That the world feels uncomfortable with Mitt Romney stems from his unclear policies and dubious character. The last person we would trust is a liar. Romney kept talking about a 5-point plan to restore the vigor in the American economy. Asked what exactly is his 5-point plan — Romney could not provide enlightening and convincing answers. The world also followed on networks like CNN the many investigations on the truthfulness of the two presidential combatants. Romney dominates the falsehood chart with outright lies, half-truths and misinterpretations. Even Mitt Romney’s own fellow Republican, Newt Gingrich, a former Speaker of the House, had stated about Romney during the primary debates: “You can’t debate somebody who is dishonest. You just can’t.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351968736926</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 14:52:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351968754171-158</Id><Title>Obama's 4 year average UE rate 9%</Title><Msg>How many of the 23 million people OUT of work or working part time WANT to vote for a guy who has the WORST UE average since 1948.

Ever since Sandy strafed the Queens peninsula and tore up the boardwalk, it’s become an often lawless place where cops are even scarcer than electrical power and food. Locals say they are arming themselves with guns, baseball bats, booby traps — even a bow and arrow — to defend against looters. Thugs have been masquerading as Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) workers, knocking on doors in the dead of night. But locals say the real workers have been nowhere in sight, causing at least one elected official — who fears a descent into anarchy if help doesn’t arrive soon — to call for the city to investigate the utility. Further exacerbating desperate conditions, it could take at least a month to repair the the bridge that connects the Rockaways to the city subway system, officials said. “We booby-trapped our door and keep a baseball bat beside our bed,” said Danielle Harris, 34, rummaging through donated supplies as children rode scooters along half-block chunk of the boardwalk that had marooned into the middle of Beach 91st St. “We heard gunshots for three nights in a row,” said Harris, who believed they came from the nearby housing projects. Carly Ruggieri, 27, who lives in water-damaged house on the block, said she barricades her door with a bed frame. “There have been people in power department uniforms knocking on doors and asking if they’re okay, but at midnight.” And another local surfer said he has knives, a machete and a bow and arrow on the ready. Gunshots and slow-rolling cars have become a common fixture of the night since Hurricane Sandy. “I would take a looter with a boa. If I felt threatened I would definitely use it,” said Keone Singlehurst, 42. “Its like the Wild West. A borderline lawless situation.” Read full story at the NY Daily news website:</Msg><Username>spandex_leggings</Username><Timestamp>1351969260610</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:01:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351969415549-169</Id><Topic><Title>now things are getting dirty!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351968030360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 14:40:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Farrakhan criticizes Obama on gay marriage and moral decline in America under Obama. “Now you have tattoos on your face and the sister puts a tattoo on her backside,” Farrakhan said. “Talk about what you were in Africa, you’re a bigger savage now than you have ever been.”</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351969415549</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:03:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351969429093-170</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA LEADS IN MAJOR POLLS (Bloomberg)</Title><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1351967597266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 14:33:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On Wednesday you should look for the nearest ledge after the LANDSLIDE.

Whom to blame for the U.S. Ambassador death? This burning question may have an easy answer. Clearly, the “folks” (this is how the President Obama characterizes them while talking in public) who killed the Ambassador and three other Americans are responsible for their deaths. But a bunch of rebels, even if armed with submachine guns and mortars, might not have succeeded in their barbaric attempt if the U.S. authorities lived up to their ostensibly topmost priority of protecting lives of the American diplomatic personnel abroad. So, why did CIA and the U.S. Military not deliver a lethal blow to the attackers when the consulate and the safe house in Benghazi was under siege, despite the calls from some of those who were fighting against the attack there? After all, both organizations are well known for their remarkable ability to air-strike with surgical precision the enemies of our nation. And as we have learned lately, the Commander-in-Chief and his cabinet were totally aware of what was going on there as the detailed video surveillance was available to them in real-time. From the first day after the attack, President Obama and his administration exercised their talents in deflecting the responsibility for their own incompetence on somebody else. Using skillfully deceptive language, they made many Americans believe that it was the anti-Islamic video that caused the violence and the deaths that resulted form the wide-spread “spontaneous” unrests. The subliminal message there was that the U.S. government could not do anything to contain these unrests, short of massacre of hundreds of participating civilians. But even taking for granted that the said incompetence left the ambassador and three Americans sitting ducks in the cross-hires of the Muslim militants’ guns, there is still a question that begs for an answer: what contributed to the impotence of this administration in dealing with military-style attack on its diplomatic post to the point that they just stood-by and watched? Contrary to what the Prez was implying, it was not the video that caused the “spontaneous” protest of Benghazi Muslims. There is no shred of evidence that would prompt a rational person to believe that such a protest actually took place September 11, 2012 in Benghazi. On the contrary, all the evidence available now clearly shows that there were no “spontaneous” demonstrations at the time the military-style attack on the U.S. Consulate was executed, or in any time immediately before that attack. So, it was not the man being accused of producing the said video, Nakoula Nakoula, who played any role in the deaths of four Americans. Therefore, he does not deserve to be blamed for the Obama administration’s lack of action that could save their lives. The clue of understanding why President Obama, who brags at times about killing Osama bin Laden, did not send any air backup to the defenders of the consulate and safe house lies in one of the statements he made while addressing the United Nations’ General Assembly. He said: “The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam.” Many commentators expressed their utmost surprise with such an intimidating declaration. After all, for non-believers Mohamed was but a normal human being and slandering him, even if reprehensible, would still be a lawful exercise of free speech protected by First Amendment. (Mind you, that some quite offensive depicting of Jesus has been recognized by the federal government, or its agencies, as an expression of art.) The puzzle remains a puzzle no more if one takes into account that there is a large organization in the U.S., the Nation of Islam, that might have a pivotal effect on the coming presidential election. Its leader, Louis Farrakhan, has already warned President Obama to not take for granted millions of black Muslim voters who may not vote for him, unless he dares to “be a little black” (a quote form one of Farrakhan’s advices to President Obama) against the will of his white advisors. The first warning of this kind from Farrakhan came in the aftermath of bombing Libya by the U.S. forces in April 2011. Outraged and angry as he can be, Farrakhan in defense of his Libyan Muslim brothers said to the Prez: “Who The Hell Do You Think You Are?” (see the reference, below). President Obama, apparently, took Farrakhan’s objection very seriously. Blacks, some nine out of 10 of whom tend to vote black, constitute only 10 percent of the American electorate, so a perspective of turning many of them away must have been a petrifying perspective for the Obama campaign.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351969807894</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:10:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351969888410-178</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA HANDLING OF HURRICANE SANDY = FEMA OUT OF WATER, LOOTING, RIOTING,2.5 MILLION WITH NO POWER, $15/GAL GAS,</Title><Username>kenya_bolshevik_from_chicago</Username><Timestamp>1351969711479</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:08:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OBAMA HANDLING OF HURRICANE SANDY = 1.

From Breibart website: FEMA out of water: "FEMA's vaunted "lean forward" strategy that called for advanced staging of supplies for emergency distribution failed to live up to its billing in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. " In fact, the agency appears to have been completely unprepared to distribute bottled water to Hurricane Sandy victims when the storm hit this Monday. In contrast to its stated policy, FEMA failed to have any meaningful supplies of bottled water -- or any other supplies, for that matter -- stored in nearby facilities as it had proclaimed it would on its website. This was the case despite several days advance warning of the impending storm. FEMA only began to solicit bids for vendors to provide bottled water for distribution to Hurricane Sandy victims on Friday, sending out a solicitation request for 2.3 million gallons of bottled water at the FedBizOpps.gov website. Bidding closed at 4:30 pm eastern."

The signs were found in a pickup truck owned by Sheet Metal Workers International, Union Local 33 in Parma, according to the police report. Many of the signs -- some measuring as large as 4 feet by 8 feet -- were believed to have been put up by members of Northwest Ohio Conservative Coalition, said John McAvoy, the group's president. Perrysburg police reported that at 1 a.m., four men – Corey Beaubian, 37, Sean Bresler, 33; and John Russell, 39, all of Toledo; and Christopher Monaghan, 41, of Rossford -- were arrested and charged with receiving stolen property.

Black liberation theology seeks to liberate people of color from multiple forms of political, social, economic, and religious subjugation and views Christian theology as a theology of liberation- "a rational study of the being of God in the world in light of the existential situation of an oppressed community, relating the forces of liberation to the essence of the Gospel, which is Jesus Christ," writes James Hal Cone, one of the original advocates of the perspective. The language of "economic parity" and references to "mal-distribution" as nothing more than channeling the views of Karl Marx. James Cone and Cornel West have worked to incorporate Marxist thought into the black church, forming an ethical framework predicated on a system of oppressor class versus oppressed.

It seems as through the most important actor during the attack may not have been the president, but CIA director David Petraeus. That leaves the storyline more confused than ever. Petraeus, the reputed savior of Iraq, is a hero to many of the same conservatives who have been driving the Benghazi story in an effort to burn the president. Now it seems possible that their ire could burn the general more than the president. Although Friday’s reports indicate that the CIA responded fast and aggressively as the attack unfolded, it also appears that the agency could have been more vigilant about security at the site in advance. It also seems possible that Mitt Romney fell silent on this issue because he came to understand that Petraeus is at least as politically exposed as Obama. (Bear in mind that Romney was recently granted classified national security briefings, as is the custom for major-party nominees.)</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351971519665</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:38:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351971577564-196</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi Bungle</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351969807894</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:10:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>baggers get confused they don't understand chain of command, they think everyone reports directly to the President.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351971577564</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:39:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351971625398-197</Id><Topic><Title>Gov Christie works on getting the vote out for Obama, just to funny, isn't he the guy who nominated Mitt?</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351971072474</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:31:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what did Obama promise Christie?

In the West Virginia Democrat primary, a felon got 40% of the vote versus Obama. In deep blue Massachusetts and Connecticut, GOP Senate candidates are even, or leading in recent polls. In pro-union Wisconsin, Walker won by a country mile. But worst of all for Mr. Obama, several recent polls show Romney competitive in Illinois -- Obama’s home state. Romney is actually winning by a landslide in the suburbs of Obama’s Chicago. Even in Cook County, the country’s biggest Democratic stronghold, Romney leads by double digits among independents (43-31) and white voters (53-40). These are very bad signs for Obama. In 2008 Democrats overwhelmingly controlled the majority of governorships. Today Republicans control the majority of Governorships. Presidential elections are always steered in each state by the governor -- the most powerful force in state politics. After the 2010 census, electoral votes were added to states that lean Republican in elections: Texas, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, South Carolina, and Utah. Deep blue Democrat states like New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Massachusetts lost electoral votes. Christians will turn out in record numbers this year. Obama has offended Christians again and again. Last election 20 million evangelical Christians did not vote. They will turn out in record numbers in 2012 to defeat the most anti-Christian President in US history. How motivated are Christians? Did you see the long lines around the country to support Chick-fil-A this summer? You’ll see those same lines on election day. Voter rolls have been purged in 2012 of felons and illegals in many states -- particularly Florida and Ohio. Turnout of Democrats will be nothing like 2008. The “Enthusiasm Factor” for Romney is huge. Conservatives are focused, intense, motivated, and enthusiastic. Democrats turned out for Obama in record numbers in 2008. Today they are demoralized. A big edge goes to Romney on Election Day as conservatives, white voters, middle class voters and independents turn out in record numbers for Romney. I know several people who voted for Obama in 2008, but never again. Does anyone know a McCain voter who will vote for Obama in 2012? There are none. Finally, history proves that a majority of undecided voters break for the challenger. Romney will take most of the undecided voters on election day -- just like Reagan did versus Jimmy Carter in 1980. Romney’s fantastic debate performance gave them confidence to choose the challenger. This is Carter/Reagan all over again. The same horrible economy. The same economically ignorant fool in the White House bringing misery to Americans. The same economic collapse under the weight of socialist, pro union, soak the rich, demonize the business owners, policies. I predict the same result on election day. Mitt Romney in a landslide.

Governor Romney’s lead may be several percentage points greater than the most recent round of polls suggests. Gallup reviewed all of its interviews with “likely voters” conducted since October 1. Its conclusion: Gallup uncovered one very significant shift in this year’s voting electorate. There has been a remarkable movement toward the Republican party. As Gallup reports: The largest changes in the composition of the electorate compared with the last presidential election concern the partisan affiliation of voters. Currently, 46% of likely voters identify as Democrats or lean Democratic, compared with 54% in 2008. But in 2008, Democrats enjoyed a wide 12-point advantage in party affiliation among national adults, the largest Gallup had seen in at least two decades. In 2012, the electorate has also become less Democratic and more Republican in its political orientation than in 2008. In fact, the party composition of the electorate this year looks more similar to the electorate in 2004 than 2008.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351976657502</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 17:04:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351977157246-213</Id><Topic><Title>Romney set to wipe out Obama</Title><Username>kaptnkirk53</Username><Timestamp>1351905543915</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 21:19:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>North Korean lib media fails to mention -- Romney also leads in downstate Illinois and Chicago suburbs.

His backup team of David Axelrod and David Plouffé serve as second-rate Jody Powells and Ham Jordans. Frankly, I preferred Jody and Ham. I must in all humility admit that it took me all of two weeks into his presidency to recognize that Obama was over his head. On February 5, 2009, I said in this space that Obama's presidency was doomed. I pronounced him a dud, unlikely to be reelected president. Said I, "…with the economy in crisis and American national security in the hands of a starry-eyed novice, one can argue that we are in for a reprise of the Carter years complete with the self-righteous pout." Well, I argued this for almost four years and today I rest my case. Next week President Obama goes into retirement. I hope he will consider Hawaii. Given my perspective, it was an easy case to call. A few months back I published my findings in The Death of Liberalism. In that book I noted that in the conservative deluge of 2010 independents combined with conservatives to turn the Liberals out. The independents do not always share the conservatives' social values, but they are very ardent for prudent economic policies. The growing debt and unbalanced budgets (both state and federal) had roused the independent vote. I said they would vote with the conservatives for years to come, because Obama and his cohorts in Congress were going to pile up trillion dollar deficits for years to come. Along with the conservatives and independents, next week will come the "uncommitted" voter. The uncommitted always goes with the challenger. There are two numbers that have been relatively underemphasized in this election, 18 percent and 24 percent. Eighteen percent is the standard cut the federal government takes of GDP. Twenty-four percent is the cut that Obama's government is taking. He says that to pay for this engorgement of the federal government all we need to do is raise taxes on the rich. The conservatives and independents recognize that there is not enough money earned by the top percentage of taxpayers to pay for it and probably not enough down below. Pithily put, we cannot afford Liberalism.

When an Ambassador dies along with 3 other Americans and the President ignores it and goes off to Vegas without so much as taking care of Business, YES he is responsible. Obama claimed on the VIEW and Letterman when asked point blank, " Is this a terrorist attack ", he responded, " We don't know yet and won't know until we get more information" In the debate Obama told the World, I knew it was a terrorist attack and said so the day after in the rose garden. You may want to call your fearless leader and ask him WHICH story he wants to run with. Obama has made a mess out of Benghazi BY LYING about it and it is biting him in the backside.

Think about that, pretty low I would say! The day the Democrats took over was NOT January 20, 2009, it was actually January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took over the House of Representatives and the Senate, at the very start of the 110th Congress. The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those wh... o are listening to liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: On January 3, 2007, the day the Democrats took control of Congress: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies had SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB CREATION! Remember that day...? January 3rd, 2007 was the day Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney), for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (but...the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? -- OBAMA!!! And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY!!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car, but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel while they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets are not passed in the White House. They are passed by Congress, and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. Obama has now gone 1,000 days without a budget, and is still blaming it on the Republicans! In that first year, Congress had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending when Bush, somewhat belatedly, got tough on spending increases. For FY 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed Lame Duck President George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of those massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself and a Democratic Congress. In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is: "I inherited a deficit that I voted for, and then I expanded that deficit four-fold since January 20th 2009."</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1351980375685</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:06:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351980561044-224</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal Teachers: Children should not be exposed to lies --</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1351980375685</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:06:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1) Only in America, could a certain politician talk about the greed of the rich at a$35,000.00 a plate campaign fund-raising event. 2) Only in America, could people claim that the government still discriminates against black Americans when they have a black President, a black Attorney General, and an 18% black federal workforce, but a black population of only 12%. . 3) Only in America, could they have had the two people most responsible for our tax code, Timothy Geithner, the head of the Treasury Department, and Charles Rangel, who once ran the Ways and Means Committee, BOTH turn out to be tax cheats who are in favor of higher taxes. 4) Only in America, could they have terrorists kill people in the name of Allah and have the media primarily react by fretting that Muslims might be harmed by the backlash. 5) Only in America, could they make people who want to legally become American citizens wait for years in their home countries and pay tens of thousands of dollars for the privilege while they discuss letting people who sneak into the country illegally just 'magically' become American citizens. 6) Only in America, could the people who believe in balancing the budget and sticking by the country's Constitution be thought of as "extremists." 7) Only in America, could they need to present a driver's license to cash a check or buy alcohol, but not to vote. 8) Only in America, could they demand the government investigate whether oil companies are gouging the public because the price of gas went up, when the return on equity invested in a major U.S. oil company (Marathon Oil) is less than half of the return of a company making tennis shoes (Nike). 9) Only in America, could the government collect more tax dollars from the people than any nation in recorded history, still spend a Trillion dollars more than it has per year - for total spending of $7-Million PER MINUTE, and complain that it doesn't have nearly enough money. 10) Only in America, could the rich people - who pay 86% of all federal income taxes - be accused of not paying their "fair share" by people who don't pay any federal income taxes at all.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1351980561044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:09:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351980582191-225</Id><Title>DEMOCRAT PARTY SAYS OBAMA WILL WIN IN LANDSLIDE</Title><Msg>DEMOCRAT PARTY SAYS OBAMA WILL WIN IN LANDSLIDE and they are never wrong.</Msg><Username>republicans_rnot_people_persons</Username><Timestamp>1351980582191</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351981764027-226</Id><Topic><Title>HAS OUR DEAR CULT LEADER SHOWN HIS TAX RETURNS YET...</Title><Username>fluteman_qreq</Username><Timestamp>1351970055701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 15:14:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mostly those who vote O-TRAITOR don't pay taxes already.</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1351981764027</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 18:29:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351982015377-227</Id><Title>I don't think campaigning at colleges and universities by obummer is productive</Title><Msg>I don't think campaigning at colleges and universities by obummer is productive Typical BAD LIB positioning and timing...

This enormous percentage of voters voting Republican would make Israel significantly redder than the most red state in the United States. Obama’s support is 40% less now from Jews in Israel than in 2008. And that kind of anti-Obama sentiment is sure to cross the Atlantic. Most Jews in Israel have relatives in America who worry about them, and if Israeli Jews feel safer with Romney, their families will be moved by that. The total number of American Jews voting in Israel is roughly 80,000. That’s about 25% of all ballots from all Americans living abroad. It represents 50% of all eligible U.S. voters in Israel, indicating that the American Jews there are greatly motivated to vote this year. That figure is double the number of ballots ever cast before. Compare that to Americans living abroad in other countries, who vote one-tenth of that frequency and are more likely to vote for Obama. What this shows is there is a strong correlation between voting for Romney and the passion to cast a vote. A significant number of the American Jews living in Israel that broke with their party to vote for Romney, and even among those who had their own Congressional Democratic candidates to support, half of them voted for Romney anyway. The strong Jewish move toward Romney bodes well for him; for roughly the last 100 years, any candidate receiving more than 30% of the Jewish vote won the election. The most telling effect of the Jews’ support for Romney may be felt in the swing states; 7,500 Israel-based Floridians voted; in Ohio there were another 3,500, and Pennsylvania added another 3,500. Obama’s contempt for Benjamin Netanyahu, his refusal to see Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, his coddling of Iran and other Islamist dictatorships; his betrayal of Israel with leaks -- all of these and more have driven the Jews of Israel to realize he is never going to be their friend.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351987045709</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 19:57:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351987047062-281</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT IS A LEGITIMATE RAPE?</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1351986496380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 19:48:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>should I take the murdering of babies comment seriously from someone that "yawns" when women are "Legitimately Raped"?</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1351987047062</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 19:57:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351987196509-282</Id><Topic><Title>WHAT IS A LEGITIMATE RAPE?</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1351986496380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 19:48:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Should anyone take you seriously about some comment made from some unknown state politician when you people ARE MURDERING BABIES daily.

Montgomery Road in Houston, NAACP members were seen advocating for President Barack Obama according to volunteer poll watchers on location at the time. According to Eve Rockford, a poll watcher trained by voter integrity group True the Vote, three NAACP members showed up to the 139 precinct location with 50 cases of bottled water and began handing bottles out to people standing in line. While wearing NAACP labeled clothing, members were "stirring the crowd" and talking to voters about flying to Ohio to promote President Barack Obama. After watching what was occurring, Rockford approached Polling Supervisor Rose Cochran about what she was seeing. "I went to the polling supervisor and let her know that it was not appropriate that they were in the building handing out water. She ignored me. I repeated my statement. She told me that she would handle it. She did nothing. I then went to the assistant supervisor and he stood up, walked over to another table and then sat down. I then walked into the waiting room and they were reloading another dolly with more cases of water," Rockford said in a True the Vote incident report. After handing out water and advocating for President Obama, the NAACP members started handpicking and moving people to the front of a long voting line inside the polling place according to the incident report. After multiple complaints from voters about the line cutting, Rockford received a phone call from downtown telling her to “stand down.” “All of the sudden one of the clerks, Dayan Cohen, said that someone wanted to speak to me on the phone. It was someone from downtown. I got on the phone and she said she was from downtown and that I needed to stand down and that it was okay for the NAACP to be within 100 ft. and they could hand out water. I told her that the NAACP was inside the building, wearing the NAACP clothing and caps and were handing out water and moving people from the back of the lines to the front of the lines,” Rockford said. At this point, NAACP members were instructed to turn their clothing inside out, which they refused to do and said they weren’t going to stop their actions inside the polling place. Their behavior and actions to move people to the front of the line continued for the rest of the evening. Texas State Representative Sylvester Turner, a former Texas NAACP leader, was also seen outside the building talking with voters. “The NAACP basically ran this poll location and the judges did nothing about it,” Rockford said."

Romney’s strengths: independent voters and more crossover support from Democrats relative to the Republicans who back Obama, according to the survey conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling &amp; Research. Romney’s crossover appeal is fueled by strong support in rural North Florida, a conservative bastion where a relatively high percentage of Democrats often vote Republican in presidential election years.
