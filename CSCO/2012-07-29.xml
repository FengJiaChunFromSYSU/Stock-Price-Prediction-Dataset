When NEWSWEEK asked Mitt if he had personally done baptisms for the dead— ROMNEY: "I have in my life, but I haven't recently." hmmm .... my, my - baptizing people you don't know and who did not give permission seems to trample on the Civil Rights of the dead person, not to mention, extremely disrespectful of the dead person. To me, Mitt Romney's actions here prove he is very egotistical, arrogant, pompous and narcissistic. Seems Mitt thinks his religion is the only real religion and if a person disagrees with Mitt, then Mitt will impede on a person's civil rights and force that person to convert to Mitt's religion when they are dead and cannot defend themselves ... by God! Yet, even though Mitt has proven, by his own actions here, that he has zero respect for people who are of "different" faith than him, Romney accuses President Obama of "assaulting religions" ... hmmm Typical Romney: no respect for anyone who is "different" from him and bullies those who cannot defend themselves - like dead people, blue collar American workers, former weaker class-mates. My Question: What will Sean Hannity say about Romney personally baptizing dead people without consent? Wasn't "Willard" a movie about lovable Rats?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1343573026164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 10:43:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343573439971-8</Id><Title>Hey Dude, #$%$</Title><Msg>Mitt Romney in Jerusalem doing what he does best, evading: He bans media from fundraiser Posted on Saturday, July 28, 2012, 1:11 pm by GottaLaff After Willard Romney’s terrible, horrible, no good, very bad London gaffe-athon, it’s understandable that he’s a little gun shy about talking to the press. Not acceptable, just understandable, because so far, he’s made an utter fool out of himself, proving himself to be inept, awkward, and unfit for office. But a total blackout? That’s crossing a line, not to mention violating protocol, especially after promising at least some of the media access to whatever it is he thinks he’s doing. On the other hand, Sheldon Adelson and all his other coveted zillionaire donors are his priority, as opposed to transparency and being accountable to American voters and anyone else in the whole wide world who might potentially be affected by a Romney White House. Via WaPo: But Romney’s campaign announced Saturday that it would block the news media from covering the event, which will be held at the King David Hotel. The campaign’s decision to close the fundraiser to the press violates the ground rules it negotiated with news organizations in April, when Romney wrapped up the Republican nomination and began opening some of his finance events to the news media. Under the agreement, a pool of wire, print and television reporters can cover every Romney fundraiser held in public venues, including hotels and country clubs. The campaign does not allow media coverage of fundraisers held in private residences. Campaign spokesman Rick Gorka declined to explain the campaign’s decision to violate protocol with the Jerusalem event. Gorka’s eventual explanation after being pressured by reporters? “That’s all I’ve got for you — it’s closed press.” Thank you. It makes so much more sense now. It seems that freedom thing only applies if you’re a Republican, because freedom of the press to cover the GOP nominee is becoming more and more limited. If this is how Team Willard behaves during a campaign, imagine how secretive they’d be if they succeed in winning their guy the immense power of the presidency.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1343573439971</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 10:50:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343575229301-9</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Dude, #$%$</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1343573439971</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 10:50:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Judging by the amount of Romney bashing on this board, Romney has you loons quite worried.
