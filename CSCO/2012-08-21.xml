That compares to 4.2 percent for people who make $100,000 or more. In some of the wealthiest neighborhoods, with a large share of people making $200,000 or more a year, the average giving rate was 2.8 percent. just like they don't pay payroll taxes (saves them 7.5%) and since they don't spend 100% of their income they save another 7% on sales taxes) then guys like Mitt hire accountants that hire lobbyist so they don't pay much in income taxes, and of course guys like Mitt claim their son's basement as his residence (instead of one of his four houses) so he can avoid state taxes</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345551245991</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 08:14:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345551295796-11</Id><Title>Mr spendy cant manage a checking account</Title><Msg>You want this guy writing checks in your childrens name?

Such a short sighted look at a bigger picture. You don't judge a CEO of a company for weeks worth of work, you judge him on his ENTIRE period. Bush gave us 8 long years of very low unemployment, he gave us a record Dow which you seem to cherish when it's Obama, and he gave us a country that was at least united. You can continue to cherry pick your facts and choose the ones that suit your agenda, but history will tell something different. I am just wondering at what point you are going to start BLAMING Obama for his policies and stop blaming Bush.

On average, the 26 companies generated net income of more than $1 billion in the U.S., the study said. The study blasted tax rules allowing unlimited deductions for CEO "performance-based" pay, like many stock options. It said the five biggest performance payers among the 26 companies took $232 million of these deductions last year. [...] The study, a 45-page attack on the corporate tax code, said deductions and credits are allowing companies to lavish big pay packages on executives so they can cut their tax bills while Washington gets less money in a time of trillion-plus deficits. [...]" ----- "[...] The broadest measure of the tax rate is total federal revenues divided by the gross domestic product. By this measure, federal taxes are at their lowest level in more than 60 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that federal taxes would consume just 14.8 percent of G.D.P. this year. The last year in which revenues were lower was 1950, according to the Office of Management and Budget. The postwar annual average is about 18.5 percent of G.D.P. Revenues averaged 18.2 percent of G.D.P. during Ronald Reagan’s administration; the lowest percentage during that administration was 17.3 percent of G.D.P. in 1984. In short, by the broadest measure of the tax rate, the current level is unusually low and has been for some time. Revenues were 14.9 percent of G.D.P. in both 2009 and 2010. [...] One would [never know from Republican talking points] that corporate taxes are [actually] expected to raise just 1.3 percent of G.D.P. in revenue this year, ABOUT A THIRD of what it was in the 1950s. The G.O.P. says global competitiveness requires the United States to reduce its corporate tax rate. But the United States actually has the lowest corporate tax burden of any of the member nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The Florida online poll of 600 likely voters, taken August 15-17, shows Obama ahead 47 to 41 percent. The president’s position is helped by a 51 percent to 39 percent lead among women and a strong showing with younger voters and Hispanics. Romney does better with those over 65 and with whites. When Libertarian Party candidate and former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson is added to the poll, Obama's lead grows to 46 percent to 39 percent. In North Carolina, Romney leads 45 to 43 percent, with a big lead among men, whites and older voters. "If Obama holds his lead in Florida then Romney has serious problems,” pollster John Zogby said. “Thus far, in the Real Clear Politics Electoral College count, Obama has sufficient leads to count 239 electoral votes and Romney has 191. 270 are needed to win. An Obama win in Florida would put him within 3 votes of a win, thus Romney would have to run the table. “Not a lock yet at all, but Obama's leads in South Florida and among Hispanics, puts him in good shape. "Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as a running mate is not hurting him among older voters but watch the attacks on Ryan's (now Romney's) budget and Medicare cuts get vicious. "Romney's lead in North Carolina takes a state away from Obama and could be a bellwether for Virginia, which Obama also won in 2008. "With Gary Johnson in the race, Obama gets 43 percent to Romney's 42 percent. Johnson's 3 percent looms pretty large .Something to watch." © 2012 Newsmax.

By refusing to reveal what is a very legitimate concern about his attitude toward taxes in general, and how he has used every conceivable loophole available to avoid paying one dollar more in taxes than he absolutely has to, gives a lot on insight into his plans to benefit the super wealthy at the expense of people who actually have to work for a living. If you were in Romney's league, you wouldn't be wasting your time on this or any other message board. Therefore, I have to conclude that you are not in the stratospheric income level - say above $10,000,000 per year - that Romney is more familiar with. If you enjoy paying north of 20% on a measly two or three hundred thousand a year while Romney pays maybe thirteen or fourteen percent on twenty million of income per year, then I guess you wouldn't be interested.</Msg><Username>skinz4q</Username><Timestamp>1345566315330</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 12:25:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345566881342-89</Id><Topic><Title>WILL KNOWN RAPIST BILL CLINTON NOMINATE OBAMA AT THE DEM CON-VENTION?</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1345566170294</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 12:22:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah how appropriate that the rapist clinton introduce the animal Obama who has been raping this nation for four long years with his evil and incompetence concerning the economy and every other aspect of administration.</Msg><Username>gregu456</Username><Timestamp>1345566881342</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 12:34:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345566911486-90</Id><Title>the election will be a referendum on the rich criminals</Title><Msg>that have outsourced our jobs overseas and have taken us to war in Iraq on a loan from China. we must either jail these criminals or tax them to the extreme.

The article detailed how Dell's new sizable dividend was a comfort for investors frustrated with a struggling stock price and a lack of growth. Strangely enough, Cisco Systems (CSCO) decided to increase its dividend by 75% when it reported earnings last week. So now that Cisco has made a similar move, it's time to analyze the new investment strategy for Cisco investors. Cisco investors will now receive a generous dividend, in addition to the benefits of the stock buyback. However, one must question what this will do to the long-term prospects for the name, and this stock hasn't exactly been an investor favorite in recent times.</Msg><Username>tonygin</Username><Timestamp>1345567367734</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 12:42:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345567627596-99</Id><Topic><Title>the election will be a referendum on the rich criminals</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1345566911486</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 12:35:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney got his money in business.

Steve King, one of the most staunchly conservative members of the House, was one of the few Republicans who did not strongly condemn Rep. Todd Akin Monday for his remarks regarding pregnancy and rape. King also signaled why — he might agree with parts of Akin’s assertion. King told an Iowa reporter he’s never heard of a child getting pregnant from statutory rape or incest. “Well I just haven’t heard of that being a circumstance that’s been brought to me in any personal way,” King told KMEG-TV Monday, “and I’d be open to discussion about that subject matter.” A Democratic source flagged King’s praise of Akin in the KMEG interview to TPM. But potentially more controversial for King is his suggestion that pregnancies from statutory rape or incest don’t exist or happen rarely. A 1996 review by the Guttmacher Institute found “at least half of all babies born to minor women are fathered by adult men.”</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345582644642</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 16:57:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345583023036-153</Id><Topic><Title>ANOTHER REPUKE CLUELESS ABOUT RAPE</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345582644642</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 16:57:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How many little boys did you diddle at your Beaver Creek mansion ???LOLOLOLOL Or did you give them enough candy to keep them quiet??

When Libertarian Party candidate and former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson is added to the poll, Obama's lead grows to 46 percent to 39 percent. In North Carolina, Romney leads 45 to 43 percent, with a big lead among men, whites and older voters. "If Obama holds his lead in Florida then Romney has serious problems,” pollster John Zogby said. “Thus far, in the Real Clear Politics Electoral College count, Obama has sufficient leads to count 239 electoral votes and Romney has 191. 270 are needed to win. An Obama win in Florida would put him within 3 votes of a win, thus Romney would have to run the table. “Not a lock yet at all, but Obama's leads in South Florida and among Hispanics, puts him in good shape. "Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as a running mate is not hurting him among older voters but watch the attacks on Ryan's (now Romney's) budget and Medicare cuts get vicious. "Romney's lead in North Carolina takes a state away from Obama and could be a bellwether for Virginia, which Obama also won in 2008. "With Gary Johnson in the race, Obama gets 43 percent to Romney's 42 percent. Johnson's 3 percent looms pretty large .Something to watch." © 2012 Newsmax.
