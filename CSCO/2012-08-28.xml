Michael Roark – A murder case underway in rural southeast Georgia has unearthed the existence of an anarchist militia group that grew out of the Fort Stewart Army base with the goal of recruiting members from the Army and stockpiling enough sophisticated weaponry to take over the government and assassinate the president. Prosecutors allege that the four members of the group who are on trial in Long County, Georgia, killed a former group member Michael Roark and his 17-year-old girlfriend by shooting them in the head to keep them silent about the militia’s activities. The militia, made up completely of active and former U.S. military, spent $87,000 buying guns and bomb parts to begin activating its plans. The name of the was F.E.A.R., short for Forever Enduring Always Ready, but authorities still aren’t sure how many members it had. The four members on trial are being charged by state authorities with malice murder, felony murder, criminal gang activity, aggravated assault and using a firearm while committing a felony. Prosecutors accuse them of killing former soldier Roark, 19, and his 17-year-old girlfriend, Tiffany York, by shooting them in the woods last December in cold-blooded fashion.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346158535516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 08:55:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346158765979-21</Id><Topic><Title>Domestic terrorist,</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346158535516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 08:55:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - An Alaska couple pleaded guilty on Monday to charges of conspiring to kill a federal judge in what prosecutors said was a revenge plot over income-tax rulings against them. Lonnie and Karen Vernon, followers of jailed Alaska militia leader Schaeffer Cox, reached a deal with prosecutors to avoid the need for a trial that had been set to begin next month. The Vernons and Cox were active in the "sovereign citizen" movement, whose adherents believe individuals are sovereign nations and federal, state and local laws do not apply to them. The Vernons each entered a guilty plea to a single count of conspiracy to commit murder for their plan to kill Alaska-based U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline, who presided over a federal income tax case that ultimately cost the couple their home. The Vernons also admitted in their plea agreement to planning to kill an Internal Revenue Service official and Beistline's daughter and grandchildren. The Vernons bought a silencer-equipped pistol and grenades in March 2011 and told the seller of the weapons about their intentions, according to the plea agreement. But the seller turned out to be a confidential government informant, and the Vernons were arrested immediately after the transaction took place. Despite entering his guilty plea, Lonnie Vernon disrupted Monday's court proceedings with a number of defiant outbursts. "If I'm accused of doing anything, I'm accused of freely exercising my First Amendment rights to the max," he told Judge Robert Bryan, who was brought in from Tacoma, Washington, to preside over the case. But Bryan told the defendant that he and others with similar political views are mistaken about their responsibilities to obey the law. "You can't decide, on your own, that you won't be part of what the government rules are," Bryan said. In exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors agreed to drop related charges concerning murder threats and illegal weapons, according to the agreement filed on Monday. Under the plea deal, Lonnie Vernon, 56, faces a prison term of 21 to 27 years when the couple is sentenced on November 14. Agreement on a specific sentence for Karen Vernon, 66, was not reached, but prosecutors pledged to recommend a sentence of no longer than 15 years and eight months. Lonnie Vernon also was a top officer in an organization called the Alaska Peacekeepers Militia, founded and led by Cox, 28. In a separate case, Cox and Lonnie Vernon were convicted in June of conspiring to murder federal and state government officials and of acquiring illegal weapons to use against their targets. Karen Vernon was not a defendant in that case. Sentencing for Cox and Lonnie Vernon on the militia-conspiracy case is set for September 14. Both men, along with Karen Vernon, have been jailed since they were arrested last year.

Woopsie The president declared a state of emergency in Louisiana late Monday, more than 24 hours before the storm was expected to hit the Gulf Coast. The declaration makes federal support available to save lives, protect public health and safety and preserve property in coastal areas. Obama has asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts with state and local officials along the Gulf Coast. FEMA has placed incident-response teams at emergency operations centers in Gulf states and has moved two support teams near areas where the storm could hit. More teams also are ready to be deployed if necessary, the White House said.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346168429384</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 11:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346168510825-52</Id><Topic><Title>Why is MITT ROMNEY RUNNING a negative campaign?

Even among those who describe themselves as ‘‘upper class’’ or ‘‘upper middle class,’’ more than half — or 52 percent — said upper-income Americans don’t pay enough in taxes; only 10 percent said they paid too much. This upper tier was more likely to say they are more financially secure now than 10 years ago — 62 percent, compared to 44 percent for those who identified themselves as middle class and 29 percent for the lower class.

At a “lecture” for students at Otterbein University in Ohio today, Mitt Romney told students that, his friend, Jimmy John, started a business by borrowing $20,000 from his parents at a low interest rate. Romney suggested anyone in the audience could do the same: This kind of devisiveness, this attack of success, is very different than what we’ve seen in our country’s history. We’ve always encouraged young people: Take a shot, go for it, take a risk, get the education, borrow money if you have to from your parents, start a business. As they noted at Think Progress, which was Harris-Perry's reaction as well, "Most students don’t have parents with $20,000 in disposable capital sitting around to give to their kids to start a business." Most Americans are not fortunate enough to be able to sell off part of the stock portfolio given to them by their father to get by either.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346181659168</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:20:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346181773923-129</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA MIGHT NOT BE THE GREATEST</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346180093987</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 14:54:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surfy, everyone in America knows that Obimbo is not the greatest thing every, which is why President Romney will fix the mess Barrack Obimbo created for the rest of us.

In phone calls and emails to WWVA radio host David Blomquist, employees at the Century Mine in Ohio said they feared retaliation if they did not attend the Romney event. "Yes, we were in fact told that the Romney event was mandatory and would be without pay, that the hours spent there would need to be made up my non-salaried employees outside of regular working hours, with the only other option being to take a pay cut for the equivalent time," the employees told Blomquist. "Yes, letters have gone around with lists of names of employees who have not attended or donated to political events." "I realize that many people in this area and elsewhere would love to have my job or my benefits," one worker explained. "And our bosses do not hesitate in reminding us of this. However, I can not agree with these callers and my supervisors, who are saying that just because you have a good job, that you should have to work any day for free on almost no notice without your consent." "We do not appreciate being intimidated into exchanging our time for nothing. I heard one of your callers saying that Murray employees are well aware of what they are getting into upon hire, or that they are informed that a percentage of their income will go to political donations. I can not speak for that caller, but this is news for me. We merely find out how things work by experience." Murray Energy Chief Financial Officer Rob Moore told Blomquist that the charges were untrue. "There were no workers that were forced to attend the event," Moore said. "We had managers that communicated to our work force that the attendance at the Romney event was mandatory, but no one was forced to attend the event. (I love the last, it was mandatory but no one was forced to attend, LOL you can't make up how stupid these baggers are, LOL)</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346181784709</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:23:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346181852282-131</Id><Title>OBIMBO HAS NOTHING TO SAY AND IS RUNNING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO SAY IT.</Title><Msg>which is sort of the way Democrats have behaved for decades.

Neither one of us had a job, because Mitt had enough of an investment from stock that we could sell off a little at a time. “'The stock came from Mitt’s father. When he took over American Motors, the stock was worth nothing. But he invested Mitt’s birthday money year to year — it wasn’t much, a few thousand, but he put it into American Motors because he believed in himself. Five years later, stock that had been $6 a share was $96 and Mitt cashed it so we could live and pay for education.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346182482409</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:34:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346182547209-142</Id><Topic><Title>Romney has solved education funding!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346181659168</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:20:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bet they could only afford to eat out 3 or 4 nights a week!!</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346182547209</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:35:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346182595106-143</Id><Topic><Title>Romney has deep support</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346181784709</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:23:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Repukes taking us back to the 1800s.

President Obama says the Bush years proved that tax cuts for the rich don't generate a vibrant economy and that a healthy middle class is the key to job growth. His Republican rival for the White House, former Governor Romney of Massachusetts, argues that Obama's plan to raise taxes on the rich amounts to putting a burden on job creators." Republicans do not understand that it isn't billionaires who create jobs, it is the consumer. Consumers buy products, and that demand is why jobs are advertised. The wealth of the CEO makes no difference. Most businesses are started by people up to their eyeballs in debt "'In the 15 years Romney ran Bain from 1984 to 1999, 22 percent of the companies went bankrupt " THANKS FOR PROVING THAT 78% WERE SUCCESSFUL!!!"

The utmost vigilance and effort is needed to ensure that social inequalities, so far from increasing, are reduced to a minimum…” “The economic prosperity of a nation is not so much its total assets in terms of wealth and property, as the equitable division and distribution of this wealth” Pope Paul VI: “We cannot proceed to increase the wealth and power of the rich while we entrench the needy in their poverty and add to the woes of the oppressed…Then there are the flagrant inequalities not merely in the enjoyment of possessions, but even more in the exercise of power“. Pope John Paul II: “One of the greatest injustices in the contemporary world consists precisely in this: that the ones who possess much are relatively few and those who possess almost nothing are many. It is the injustice of the poor distribution of the goods and services originally intended for all“. Pope Benedict XVI: “The world’s wealth is growing in absolute terms, but inequalities are on the increase…. The scandal of glaring inequalities continues…” “The dignity of the individual and the demands of justice require, particularly today, that economic choices do not cause disparities in wealth to increase in an excessive and morally unacceptable manner, and that we continue to prioritize the goal of access to steady employment for everyone. .. Through the systemic increase of social inequality, both within a single country and between the populations of different countries, not only does social cohesion suffer, thereby placing democracy at risk, but so too does the economy, through the progressive erosion of “social capital”: the network of relationships of trust, dependability, and respect for rules, all of which are indispensable for any form of civil coexistence”. “Therefore, it must be borne in mind that grave imbalances are produced when economic action, conceived merely as an engine for wealth creation, is detached from political action, conceived as a means for pursuing justice through redistribution.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346183040698</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:44:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346183083070-151</Id><Topic><Title>ANN ROMNEY...I BUY AT COSTCO !!!</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346182897428</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:41:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reminds me of Michelle shopping at Target last year.

The poll finds Romney ahead of Obama by 50-43! -- far, far different from the published polls. (The sample was 33% Democrat, 31% Republican, 11% black, and 8% Latino). Apart from the head-to-head vote question, this survey tracks with the others on most of its internals. Obama's personal favorability is 47-50 while Romney's is 48-48. The president's job approval is at 46%. Asked who would do the best job of: Improving the economy = O-39 / R-49 Creating jobs = O-38 / R-50 Strengthening Medicare = O-44 / R-42 While the Medicare issue is important, it is not the major factor. Asked which is more important, "protecting and strengthening Medicare or improving the economy and creating jobs?" The economy wins by 67-18. Comparing Medicare plans without explaining them, voters break even with 41% favoring Obama's and 42% backing Romney's. Asked which scares them the most, Obama's scared 46% and Romney's scared 44%. But Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan has scored a bull's eye by his comparison of the two Medicare plans and the following answers indicate: Whose plan do you agree with more? Obama who would save $716 in Medicare spending and use the money to cover the uninsured or Romney who would make the same savings but use the funds to extend the life of the Medicare trust fund? Obama's 38% / Romney's 53% And the President continues to draw big negatives over his plans to intervene in medical decision making: President Obama's health care law sets up a Board to issue guidelines and instructions to doctors and hospitals on what procedures, medications, or treatment to use for each illness. Do you agree or disagree with this aspect of Obama's legislation? Agree: 33% / Disagree: 61% After argumentation, disagreement with Obama's Medicare cuts becomes even sharper: Supporters of this provision say that it will allow us to save funds in Medicare without cutting care. They say that the Board can stop unnecessary tests or overly costly treatments that do not help the patients. But opponents say that it will lead to rationing of Medicare treatment. They say that the Board would ban the most effective medicines to treat cancer, for example, because they are too expensive and might stop old people from getting hip replacements or heart bypasses. In view of these arguments, do you agree or disagree with this aspect of Obama's legislation? Agree: 30% / Disagree: 57% Voters agree by 56-20 that "Romney and Ryan would not change Medicare for current beneficiaries or for people who are now over 55." And, by 25-60, they reject the statement that "Romney and Ryan would end Medicare and leave the elderly without a good alternative." By 48-33, voters agree that "President Obama has not proposed any real long term fix for Medicare" although by 63-18 they agree that "In a few years, Medicare will exhaust its trust fund and will go bankrupt unless we enact changes and reforms." But Romney still has some selling to do. Only 38% agreed and 31% disagreed that "Romney will always allow elderly to stay in traditional Medicare. He will just offer a voucher system that will have more attractive alternatives." In evaluating the health care and Medicare issue, voters feel that high medical malpractice costs play a key role in driving up costs. By 63-20, they agree that "the abuse of medical malpractice law suits is a big reason medical costs are so high." By 57-37, they support Romney's proposals to "curb medical malpractice litigation" agreeing that it "will save billions and extend the life of Medicare."</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1346184995274</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 16:16:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346185031736-192</Id><Title>THE BIGGEST LIE: ROMNEY IS A BUSINESSMAN</Title><Msg>One of the ways Mitt's campaign has been dealing with this problem on the stump is by pushing the quasi-fact that, despite his father’s considerable wealth, Mitt earned his personal fortune on his own. To some extent, this point is accurate. The vast majority of Mitt Romney’s wealth comes from his time at Bain Capital and not from inheritance. It is fair to say that Mitt Romney created most of his own fortune. What's not entirely fair is to suggest that he earned it. That’s because Mitt Romney didn’t amass his vast quantities of wealth with any stroke of ingenuity or invention. He didn’t come up with a novel idea and build a company from the ground up. Romney made his cash burdening other peoples’ companies with debt and then selling them off piece by piece. I don’t think anyone in America has a problem with an entrepreneur finding success with great ideas and a sound business model. What Americans have trouble respecting is the ill-begotten fortunes amassed at corporate chop shops like Bain Capital. The biggest lie of the Romney campaign (so far…) has been the touting of his business acumen and private sector experience. Mitt Romney has never run a real business. He’s never created and sold a product, tracked inventory, paid bills… He spent his whole career in that dubious sector of the American economy wherein selfish white guys move money from one pile to another to turn it into more money. He wasn’t doing anything illegal, but he wasn't doing anything admirable either.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346185031736</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 16:17:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346185066900-193</Id><Title>Bill Ayers.....Admitted Terrorist</Title><Msg>Does it bother anyone that he is a good friend of Obama's?

Another troubling one reared its head again this week when he told a group of entrepreneurial Otterbein University students at a campaign stop in Ohio that they should just borrow money from their parents to get their businesses started. "We've always encouraged young people: Take a shot, go for it. Take a risk, get the education, borrow money if you have to from your parents, start a business," said Romney. "This is kind of an American experience.” No, Mitt. This is kind of a “Romney” experience. A gaffe like this one in isolation probably wouldn’t mean much, but a dangerous pattern is developing for the Romney campaign. Whether he’s offering up an off-hand $10,000 bet to Rick Perry or building a car elevator in his ninth home, Romney is making it increasingly obvious that he has no idea what it’s like for 99.99% of Americans. That’s a problem.

Romney is a sissy for not defending himself, when the other guy is lying and kicking below the belt you should defend yourself not smile. I know Obama is saying anything to change the subject from his failure as a President. What did you expect from a Chicago thug. He has won all his campaigns by going nasty. Obama found dirt on Jack Ryan, Jeri Ryan's then husband. McCain would not stoop to even calling him Hussein, vetting Obama's Rezko, Ayers, Wright and Farrakhan connections. Obama is not a nice guy, he lies easily, and seems to enjoy being nasty. Many of his followers on this message board are nasty and love to be nasty too. But remember Obama is losing big, he is begging for money and now he has all but kissed the Catholic advantage amongst Dems goodbye. The Church is going to sue Obama over his breaking their right to religious freedom. Obama is nasty, and his likeability is now under 50%.

Carlyle's answer: Absolutely nothing. Presidents don't decide how much gasoline costs. It is a very broad commodity market that is completely priced by supply &amp; demand. Nor do national energy policies have much effect within the timeframe of a single presidential term – it takes years to bring new oil supplies to market or shift usage patterns. For that matter, almost all budgetary and economic changes that happen in the first 1-2 years of a president's term were caused by their predecessor! This causes a lot of misconceptions about presidential effectiveness. (Did you know almost every cent of spending increases under the Obama Administration was enacted under Bush? Neither party wants to talk about that.)</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346186445574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 16:40:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346186555761-206</Id><Topic><Title>Frank Marshall Davis.....Who is this?</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1346184990031</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 16:16:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Flutie, take it easy man.

Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told the Guardian last year: “The extent is going down, but it is also thinning… There will be ups and downs, but we are on track to see an ice-free summer by 2030.” 2) Humans are largely to blame for the Arctic melt. A new study in this month’s Environmental Research Letters concludes that between 70 and 95 percent of the Arctic melt since 1979 has been caused by human activity. Man-made global warming has rapidly heated up the Arctic — the region has been warming about twice as fast as the global average. (See here for a good explanation of why.) What’s more, soot and other pollutants from smokestacks in Europe and Asia have traveled up to the Arctic. When those dark particles settle onto the snow and ice, they absorb sunlight and start sizzling.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346187215375</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 16:53:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346187388276-212</Id><Topic><Title>Convicted FELON Tony Rezko</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1346186443550</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 16:40:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unbelieveable, GW Bush is running for President AGAIN.

The poor of New Orleans will storm the levees and steal the bags, thereby putting themselves at risk for the eventual flooding that’ll happen once they remove the bags. That way Republicans can get rid of even more Democrats in Louisiana and shore up the state for themselves.” On Monday’s show, Limbaugh suggested the National Hurricane Center, which is part of the Commerce Department, was manipulating their Isaac forecasts to help President Barack Obama.

The monthly newsletter, which was first uncovered by Right Wing Watch, tends to be filled with inflammatory right wing rhetoric. But the March edition went a little further than usual. “We have before us a challenge to remove an ideologue unlike anything world history has ever witnessed or recognized,” editor Ponch McPhee wrote. “An elected leader who shuns biblical praise, handicaps economic ability, disrespects the honor of earned military might.” From there it only gets crazier: The ultimate task for the people is to remain vigilant and aware ~ that the government, their government is out of control, and this moment, this opportunity, must not be forsaken, must not escape us, for we shall not have any coarse [sic] but armed revolution should we fail with the power of the vote in November ~ This Republic cannot survive for 4 more years underneath this political socialist ideologue. McPhee’s poor spelling mirrors his poor grasp of history; aside from the notion of the president as history’s greatest ideologue, McPhee would do well to remember that Virginia’s last armed revolution didn’t exactly work out. McPhee should expect a visit from the Secret Service in the near future, given that they investigated Ted Nugent last month for his similar threats against President Obama.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346190436246</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 17:47:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346190607881-233</Id><Topic><Title>baggers don't believe in democracy, they figure if they lose they can just revolt, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346190436246</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 17:47:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah they "shall not have any coarse" LOL didn't any bagger get out of high school?

Dolan, the archbishop of New York and president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, also will give the closing benediction at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., on Thursday. When he accepted that invitation, Dolan said his appearance would be prayerful, not political, a sentiment reiterated by his spokesman in announcing his appearance at the DNC.

Posted: 28 Aug 2012 06:10 AM PDT In a move which might be the most mind-bending placement of law over reality I’ve ever heard of, Republicans in Arizona have declared that pregnancy begins up to two weeks before conception. Specifically, they say that if you become pregnant, the law will now hold that you have in fact been pregnant since the end of your last menstrual cycle. Even though you haven’t. Perhaps Jan Brewer ought to go to her Ob/Gyn and tell him she’s pregnant because she’s planning to have unprotected sex next week, and see how he repsonds. The purpose of this new law is to make medical terminations of pregancy illegal two weeks earlier than in any other state. Frighteningly, it also removes provisions for late-term abortions in medical emergencies, and compels women to undergo an (unnecessary, expensive) ultrasound scan the day before the abortion takes place. I could open up a debate about the medical ethics of attempting to emotionally blackmail a patient into making a different decision versus informed consent, but I’m too busy being disgusted. Stay classy, GoP. Stay classy. Edit: Here’s a pertinent question – If you’re pregant two weeks before conception, doesn’t that make birth control a form of abortion?

And Maher who Dems still haven't given his million back to explain Calling Palin The "C" work among other things. Palin is not scheduled to be a speaker. But Romney needs the womans , Tea party and Christian vote so he should be advised to make a slot for her to speak As I heard it he wanted to give her just 10 minutes on condition that she get her speech approval from Mitt. Palin told him she get $100,000 per speech speaking fee and has elected since 2010 50 candidates for the GOP and doesn't need Romney. Palin is the most exciting speaker the Gop has. Mitt is probably afraid he will be upstaged, overshadowed and all people will remember about the convention is Palin.
