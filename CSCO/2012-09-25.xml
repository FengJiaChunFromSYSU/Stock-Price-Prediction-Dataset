The United States is woefully behind much of the world in this field. The reasons are complex, involving failures by the private sector, academia and government at all levels. Although any political perspective on the part of Wozniak is unmentioned by the media I will add that the Republican obsession with defeating Obama to the exclusion of any bipartisanship in governance (source Mitch McConnell) is not helping.

In Florida, the president is up 51 to 47 percent. Among all registered Florida voters, Obama is up nine percentage points. The new numbers come one week after a Washington Post poll in Virginia showing Obama with a clear lead there. More than half of all money spent in the campaign has focused on these three states, and many analysts say Romney has to win two of the three to capture the White House. The past few weeks have been difficult for the Romney campaign, and the nominee’s advisers vowed to hit the reset button this week. But with the first debate scheduled for Oct. 3, the Romney is under new pressure to get his campaign refocused. The new polls add to the evidence that Obama has benefited most from the two parties’ conventions, a series of sharp, long-distance exchanges and a barrage of television ads.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348577224871</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 08:47:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348577464079-11</Id><Title>I was going to vote Romney</Title><Msg>but it's pretty clear he is going to lose now and who wants to vote for a loser?

The first Presidential debate is October 3, with a second October 16 and a final face-to-face October 22. On Saturday night, 1,500 donors showed up for the Romney fundraiser. Among the attendees were producer Jerry Bruckheimer and wife Linda; former Warner Bros chair Terry Semel; Children Of A Lesser God producer Burt Sugarman; Gladiator producer Frank Price and wife Katherine; DC 9/11: A Time Of Crisis writer-producer Lionel Chetwynd; actor John O’Hurley, CSI: NY’s Gary Sinise; and Everyone Loves Raymond’s Patricia Heaton, Deadline confirmed. Tickets went for $1,000, $15,000, and $50,000.

"Well, we do provide care for people who don't have insurance," he said in an interview with Scott Pelley of CBS's "60 Minutes" that aired Sunday night. "If someone has a heart attack, they don't sit in their apartment and die. We pick them up in an ambulance, and take them to the hospital, and give them care. And different states have different ways of providing for that care." This constitutes a dramatic reversal in position for Romney, who passed a universal health care law in Massachusetts, in part, to eliminate the costs incurred when the uninsured show up in emergency rooms for care. Indeed, in both his book and in high-profile interviews during the campaign, Romney has touted his achievement in stamping out these inefficiencies while arguing that the same thing should be done at the national level.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348594747151</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 13:39:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348594908109-107</Id><Title>Republicans' TWO CRAZY UNCLES!!!!!</Title><Msg>Republicans have now two crazy uncles they are trying to keep hidden from public view until elections are over and they are (drum beat please!) : TEA PARTY PUKES and EVANGELICAL PUKES.

Their magic underwear are worn under their real underwear. Picture a woman wearing a man's T-shirt and boxer briefs under her bra and panties, and that's the look. They even sew embroidered patches into their magic undies, adding even more mystical, magical gibberish to the mix. I had a boss who was a Mormon priesthood holder on the side. You could see the outline of his magic underwear on his upper legs through his trousers. He professed to be some kind of moral role model but in actuality all he worshipped was money. He treated his staff like slaves and his upper management (all women) like sister wives. In addition to thinking his magic drawers would bring him x-ray vision, the ability to fly and other insane delusions, he also thinks when he dies he'll inherit his own planet to rule. He hides behind a conservative, family values, religious Christian Republican facade, but in reality the man is totally batsh$t crazy. A garment worn by extremely devout followers of the the mormon cult. It is basically a set of long underwear but the mormons beleive it protects them from evil. Some peole might try and argue that it isn't called magic underwear but if it really protects you from evil then its gotta be magic. You want an example? I donno, ask a mormon for one the next time one comes to your door to convert you. A nickname for Mormon underwear. this nickname is disliked by Mormons Mormons who have been through the masonic 'Mormon endowment ceremony' wear special underwear which they call 'G's' or 'Garments'. every non-Mormon refers to them as 'magic underwear'. they are an ugly 2 piece set - like long johns and a t shirt - which are white, with white embroidered masonic symbols on the breast and 1 knee. The symbols represent a masonic square (L), a compass(^) and a level (-). Women wear bra and tights OVER the top of their magic underwear despite protestations from Mormons about the nickname for their underwear, every Mormon will have heard stories from fellow Mormons about how their garments have protected them from all sorts of harm - fire, gunshots, animal bites, accidental cuts, etc This is the reason they are referred to as 'Magic'. basically, Mormons are wiling to ascribe magical status to their underwear, but get offended if anyone refers to them as such Drying off after her shower, Princess Ann quickly donned her magic underwear before putting on her black lacy bra over the top Underwear of the mormon religion. Also known as Garments or simply G's. These Magic underwear give mormons the power of flight, invisibility, x-ray vision and gardening.
