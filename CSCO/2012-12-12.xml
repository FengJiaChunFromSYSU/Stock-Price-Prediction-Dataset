According to anti-immigration campaigners the 2011 census shows that three of the white people live in Dorset and two live in Yorkshire. Julian Cook, from the Anti-Immigration Alliance, said: “Scotland and Wales have one each, while there are now no white people at all in Northern Ireland.” Cook said the demographic shift has been caused by a gradual change in the skin colour of more than 56 million previously white people as a direct result of immigration. He added: “These figures prove that if you live in an area with a high percentage of brown-skinned foreigners then after two years you start to go brown too.” Jane Thompson, a former white person from Guildford, said: “I don’t recognise myself anymore. Or anyone else for that matter. When I see someone I think I know I have to stand very close to them and then imagine what they would look like if they were white. “When I was young very few people changed colour. But what can you do?” Bill McKay, one of the seven remaining white people, said: “I feel very different. Why haven’t I gone brown? Perhaps I’m King Arthur.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355314950537</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 07:22:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355315513087-4</Id><Title>You CAN change your skin color....</Title><Msg>Mormons and Those Other Minorities Posted: 11 Dec 2012 02:00 AM PST The elapse time of internet parodies continues to shorten. In imitation of the PR move and website directed at homosexuals, mentioned here, there’s now a biting parody website, Mormons and Negros: Where the Church Stands: "Being black is a complex reality for many people. Having dark skin isn’t itself a sin, but it is often an indicator of past sin. Even though individuals are sometimes cursed with dark skin because of sins committed in this lifetime, others may not have sinned in this life: those who were less valiant in the war in heaven are born with dark skin. The site even dug up an old tradition that almost every Mormon could wish gone: the idea that as non-whites become truly faithful, they will become white. My understanding is that this has always been a minority belief, but it continues to pop up: Fortunately, God can help those who were born black overcome their skins of darkness and become “white and delightsome” once again – the curse can be removed! Both Brigham Young and Spencer W. Kimball, among others, spoke of this miracle of miracles. President Kimball even saw this happening among the Lamanites (Native Americans) after they were brought into white foster homes."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355315513087</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 07:31:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355319366134-5</Id><Title>stock market a little expensive right now...take profits</Title><Msg>and come back to fight another day</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1355319366134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 08:36:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355319582469-6</Id><Topic><Title>$21++ this month</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1355228897493</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 07:28:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i actually sold yesterday at $20.04 because I didn't like the action.

When it comes to the so-called “fiscal cliff,” the public supports the president by margins even larger than those by which he won re-election in November. Beginning in 2013, the automatic ending of the Bush tax cuts and automatic spending cuts would most likely send the economy into a recession. The president has made a proposal calling for what he calls a “balanced approach” of spending cuts with the ending of tax breaks for the rich, while the GOP’s counteroffer demanded larger cuts and much less in revenues. Here are five reasons the Republicans have little to no leverage on the “fiscal cliff” other than a threat that the president will begin his second term cleaning up another Republican-sparked economic crisis. In almost every poll you’ll find 6 out of 10 Americans support higher taxes on the rich. Independents agree at about that same percentage. The question that isn’t clear from the polling is if the public wants higher tax rates or if ending deductions would be good enough. It’s also clear from polls that the so-called “entitleOn the night of President Obama’s first inauguration, a small group of Republican leaders, including Paul Ryan, met with messaging guru Frank Luntz and former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich to plot their strategy to counter the new president. It came down to one word: No. This recalcitrance and commitment to slow the recovery to a financial crisis that started when Bush was in office is finally having some blowback. Wall Street nemesis Elizabeth Warren is now on the Senate Banking Committee and the public simply doesn’t trust the GOP to negotiate in good faith. A recent poll from The Hill found that 50 percent of voters believe that President Obama and the Democrats are being “more reasonable” in the “fiscal cliff” negotiations than House Speaker John Boehner and the Republicans, compared to 38 percent who believe that Boehner and the GOP are being more reasonable. And the fact that nearly all the Republicans in Congress have signed a pledge to never, ever compromise on taxes certainly isn’t helping this image.ment reforms” the GOP wants are extremely unpopular (probably because they’re designed to eventually kill the program). What was amazing about the stunt to hold the debt limit hostage for cuts was the solidarity from House Republicans as they vowed to stand together in threatening the global economy by defaulting on America’s debts. This time around a few congressman have made it clear that they should extend tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans. Tom Cole (R-OK) has called for a vote. Brian Bilbray (R-CA), who is retiring at the end of his term, and Mary Bono Mack (R-CA), who lost in November, also have joined the list of those willing to vote for higher rates in the right deal. Democrats like to say the GOP is holding middle-class tax cuts hostage. But their real hostage is the Dow. If they hold off on passing tax cuts for 98 percent of America until 2013, the only people who will feel the blunt impact of that choice at first is those people who are invested in the stock market. Of course, that will kill jobs and spike unemployment, making our jobs crisis worse, but those who have the most invested in the market, the rich, will likely see a loss that could easily equal the small tax increase the president is asking for on income over $250,000. This is the number one reason why corporate America is suddenly done with the Tea Party.Republicans got through most of 2012 without acknowledging reality. Then came the election. President Obama is the first president to be elected twice with 51 percent of the popular vote since Dwight Eisenhower. His popularity is hovering around it was around the time bin Laden was killed. He won by laying out the exact proposals he said he’s given to Republicans. If this battle lingers on, he’ll have the world’s greatest platform — his inauguration — to make his case to the people. And he never has to be elected again. If you’re negotiating, this is the position you want to be in.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355322750596</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 09:32:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355323130393-10</Id><Topic><Title>REPUKES WANT HSBC NOT TO BE FINED...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1355277323963</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 20:55:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your story is weak,Surf.

Those who reject any part of this plan are not only ignorant, but are also guilty of actively trying to undermine the nation and its government. STEP ONE: Eliminate school breakfast and lunch programs, Medicaid, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, Medicare, PBS, New Mexico, elk, the Coast Guard, and all dams. STEP TWO: Eliminate all nonessential public school programs entirely and offer only three courses: Corn Farming, Nuclear Weaponry, and Print Journalism. STEP THREE: Eliminate federal prison system by converting U.S. territory of Guam into an unsupervised penal colony known as “The Gauntlet.” STEP FOUR: Eliminate a randomly selected 8 percent of the nation’s total population, preferably teenagers or very young children from the Iowa or Minnesota regions. STEP FIVE: Raise taxes on single mothers to encourage them to work harder. The Onion has repeatedly called for a national referendum on how best to punish single mothers, and yet Congress has remained silent. STEP SIX: Cut all foreign aid, with the sole exception of support for Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian government, as they need our help the most. STEP SEVEN: Raise the cost of fishing licenses to $140,000. STEP EIGHT: Increase special interest loopholes and tax deductions for The Onion. If this eight-point plan is followed to the letter, then crisis will be averted. Failure to comply with the Onion’s plan will result in catastrophe on a national scale as well as the faster ascendance of our future Chinese Overlords, whose inevitable rise to power we nonetheless welcome with open arms, for they are America’s cultural and economic superiors. On that note, The Onion would like to offer the following message to Chinese premier Wen Jiabao: Peace be with you, glorious comrade of the Far East! It is now but a matter of time until you take ownership of our slovenly American homeland, and we would like to remind you that esteemed journalistic institutions—especially those like ours, which are more than willing to compromise their claim to objectivity—could prove highly useful to your great nation’s sophisticated propaganda wing. Let us help you reeducate the American pig people and spread word of your magnificence.

It's a new, $63-per-head fee to cushion the cost of covering people with pre-existing conditions under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul. The charge, buried in a recent regulation, works out to tens of millions of dollars for the largest companies, employers say.

No waiting for hours because it ‘isn’t polite to leave yet’ As the season of compulsory family fun approaches, there is increasing jealously towards those who do not have relatives or have managed to ostracise them. Plumber Stephen Malley said: “I was married with three kids but I faked my own death in a hovercraft accident just to avoid Christmas with my wife’s parents. “Probably the kids were upset but I know it’ll be worth it. I shall be watching war films in bed at just about the time my father-in-law usually starts being racist.” Margaret Gerving, a retired headmistress from Guildford, said: “My niece insists on coming over but I make her leave the presents outside. “Usually she says ‘Merry Christmas’ through the letterbox, to which I reply, ‘Go away, I’ve got a harpoon gun’.” However 83-year-old Emma Bradford has found her family unavoidable: “They come and get me, manhandle me into a car. “My son’s wife – I just call her ‘she’ or ‘that woman’ – undercooks the sprouts by an hour. “She then shouts in my face and gives me a box of lavender soap, which I feed to their dog.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355331506563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 11:58:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355331573379-52</Id><Topic><Title>Election behind us -Obama promised to move forward</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355325585172</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 10:19:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obamas trying to pass a bill?

The aggressive antagonism of rude democrats accross the internet must be confronted. It thought it would be productive to confront them logically, but it seems they only understand insults. I recognize that it must have been difficult for them to grow up having everyone call them feg or ni88er. Of course, they might actually grow up someday and realize that this is how children act. The black kids called me "whitey" or "honky" and I took it in stride. I grew up and got over it. Some people on this board need to grow up, or maybe Yahoo needs to restrict children's access? Lots of Americans are incapable of reason and logic. All of us are capable of name-calling and blaming. Our politicians should know better, and that's why I usually argue the Republican side.

Before Tuesday’s about-face, the Business Roundtable had insisted that the White House extend Bush-era tax cuts to taxpayers of all income brackets, but the executives’ resistance crumbled as pressure builds to find a compromise for the fiscal impasse in Washington before the end of the year. “We recognize that part of the solution has to be tax increases,” David M. Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, said on a conference call with reporters. “That’s the only thing that allows a reasonable compromise to be reached.” Even as the Fortune 500 leaders announced their shift, the White House continued to work behind the scenes to woo some of Wall Street’s most powerful financiers — a group that had largely abandoned President Obama in his bid for a second term after supporting him in 2008.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355337899386</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 13:44:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355338026695-81</Id><Topic><Title>teabilly autobigraphy title: THE COURAGE OF MY IGNORANCE!"</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355337775921</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 13:42:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Never get of the wheel chair, never stop wearing a black NRA T-shirt with the eagle, always sport a mullet, never stop yelling, 'those socialists want to take away my social security and medicare'</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1355338026695</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 13:47:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355338098024-82</Id><Topic><Title>now only the lower class tea baggers are not on board</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355337899386</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 13:44:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cut n paste big mouth gfo/Donna, doesn't have an ounce of her own sense so has to paste FAR LEFT garbage NON STOP.

I’m not a betting man, but if I had to guess, I’d say that after eight years of Hillary there will be eight years of Michelle, then eight years each for Chelsea, Sasha, and Malia.” But “not so fast,” says Democratic strategist Tracy Klugian, who believes such predictions sell Hillary short: “Assuming her current poll numbers hold up in 2024, I think it’s safe to say that Hillary Clinton will be the most popular President in U.S. history. In that event, the Twenty-second Amendment, which limits the President to two terms, will be repealed and Hillary will run again.” Mr. Logsdon, however, scoffs at that scenario: “If the Twenty-second Amendment is repealed, Bill will run again.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355340688874</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 14:31:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355340728454-119</Id><Topic><Title>fed the pain maker</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355340124435</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 14:22:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know this is true.

Maybe not, I sure hope not. I do believe the main reason we don't see enormous inflation now is the recent financial disruption, sub prime mortgage, which was the straw that broke the camels' back, and subsequent restraint on capital....still not sure why we don't see some inflation.

We won't need so much Ethanol, and eventually we'll get a crop that doesn't flood or drought to fill up the silos. Then they can start feeding animals again.

By 2060, non-whites will make up 57 percent of the U.S. population, more than doubling from 116.2 million in 2012 to 241.3 million, according to projections by the U.S. Census Bureau released on Wednesday. Racial minorities are now 37 percent of the population, it said. The shift will largely be fueled by minority births that continue to outpace those of whites, the agency said, based on data from the 2010 Census.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355351035321</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 17:23:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355351041109-227</Id><Topic><Title>Surfandski the neighborhood white gay boy, I take it ?</Title><Username>orenthal_james_obama</Username><Timestamp>1355350262359</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 17:11:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did yahoo censor my reply?

Rates will go up the top 2%. No way around it. It won't hurt that much. For the record, when employment goes up and stabilizes, I think tax rates should go up on everybody until debt is under control. Then, when under control, surprise surpise, the verk believes a balanced budget should be required...unless war...unless recession. Once the budget balanced....medicare for all...universal healthcare on the way. Will happen under the Hillary Clinton admin. See your future..be your future.
