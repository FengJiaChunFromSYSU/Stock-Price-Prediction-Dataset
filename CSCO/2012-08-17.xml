I. Forget ballot box irregularities. There's a virtual dust-up under way over how Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney amassed more than 100,000 new Twitter followers in just one weekend. It may seem trivial, but not to social networking junkies or campaigns mindful of the need to project a digital image of popularity and power. An analysis by the technology firm Barracuda Labs found most of the Twitter users who followed Romney over that July weekend were probably fake, although it's impossible to know who's behind the spike: Romney's campaign, a supporter or an opponent. Romney went from 673,000 to 814,000 followers during that time, though that number has since risen to more than 861,000.

He would also repeal the estate and alternative minimum taxes. Tax rates on capital gains and dividends would remain at 15 percent and the corporate tax rate would be cut to 25 percent from 35 percent. “The whole thing is a disingenuous exercise because it’s politically absolutely impossible,” said Martin Sullivan, an economist and contributing editor at Tax Notes. “All of the tax benefits for the rich are very explicit. All of the offsetting tax increases on the rich are entirely vague.” ‘Wealthiest Folk’ Obama has been using the center’s study as a weapon against Romney since it was released Aug. 1. “Governor Romney’s tax plan would actually raise taxes on middle-class families with children by an average of $2,000 to pay for this big tax break that’s going mostly to the wealthiest folk,” Obama said Aug. 14 in Oskaloosa, Iowa. The Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution in Washington, tried to test whether Romney could meet his objectives on rates, revenue and progressivity all at once. The center estimated that in 2015, the rate cuts would provide a $360 billion tax break for taxpayers making more than $200,000 a year. Then the researchers tried to figure out whether there were enough tax breaks flowing to high-income people that could be eliminated, assuming that breaks for savings and investment remained.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345210829369</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345210992071-44</Id><Topic><Title>We will settle for 5 years Mitt</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345209461348</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:17:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mitt says he doesn't want to spend time talking about his taxes, LOL it's easy Mitt just release your tax returns, if you're not a felon the issue goes away, but of course you can't release those years because they are the years that show you took the tax amnesty</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345210992071</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:43:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345211142215-45</Id><Topic><Title>YEP GREG IS ON THE POPOFF AGAIN...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345185279263</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 02:34:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like last night Greg kept drinking into the morning.

Ever since John Kennedy, Democrats have had a weakness for dashing younger men like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and, I suppose, Jimmy Carter. They balance their tickets with senior statesmen--Lyndon Johnson, Joe Biden, Walter Mondale. (Al Gore was young but played ancient.) Republicans do the opposite: with the exception of Bush-Cheney, they select a senior statesman as their presidential candidate and a dynamic, young and often ideological type for No. 2. Richard Nixon was a ripe old 39 when Dwight Eisenhower chose him, Dan Quayle was 41, Sarah Palin was 44--and now Paul Ryan, 42, is the perfect picture of a traditional Republican Vice President. (PHOTOS: Paul Ryan's Life and Career) But there is something radically different about the Ryan pick, something I've never seen before. This presidential campaign is now, substantively, all about him. That was sort of true of Palin, but her disastrous insubstantial, not her beliefs, was the issue. This time, the maddeningly vague Mitt Romney has effectively outsourced his job as intellectual leader of the ticket to his occasionally specific junior partner. Romney seems to have mixed feelings about that, flipping another flop on the Ryan budget, which he once called "marvelous" and now has walked away from, saying he's going to come up with a budget of his own one of these days. Romney also had a fair amount of trouble describing his view of Ryan's plan to voucherize Medicare. The Ryan pick may have energized the Republican base, but Romney remains the same old awkward, evasive Romney. And so we seem to be headed for a campaign of ideas--Ryan's ideas--and that may or may not be a good thing. Yes, it's important to have a ground-zero discussion about the sort and size of government we want to have. The trouble with Ryan's deep thinking on so many of these issues, though, is that it's not very deep at all. He lives in a libertarian Disneyland where freedom is never abused, where the government is an alien entity whose only function is to flummox the creative intelligence of übermensches like Ayn Rand's hero, the architect Howard Roark. It is remarkable and, frankly, a bit terrifying that this puerile vision has become the operating philosophy of the Republican Party.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo8</Username><Timestamp>1345217698949</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:34:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345217728879-81</Id><Topic><Title>OBVIOUSLY MITT ROMNEY not a serious candidate !</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo8</Username><Timestamp>1345214530022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:42:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no platform either - just opaque slop - as for the ryan budget - he is for it - of course there might be some differences - and there will be parts where they agree - but mostly he is for it - except where he is not - they are closely looking at everything now - the Pinocchio twins romney and ryan</Msg><Username>hulksweider2000</Username><Timestamp>1345217728879</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:35:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345218316157-82</Id><Topic><Title>Name ONE Demographic Which Ryan HELPS Mitt Romney Win</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo8</Username><Timestamp>1345216311336</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:11:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obummer running against Mitt Demoncraps want us to care more about Romneys money and what he does with it than they want us to care about OUR money and what Obummer does with it !</Msg><Username>signalmn</Username><Timestamp>1345218316157</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:45:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345218453001-83</Id><Title>Europe already priced into CSCO</Title><Msg>Why all this talk about bad news from Europe?

The September 23, 2009, deadline for certain FBAR filers and certain offshore-related information returns who have no unreported income is also extended to Oct. 15, 2009.. All other guidance included on the page may still be relied upon. January 8, 2010 - added Q&amp;As 53-54 August 25, 2009 - added Q&amp;A 52 July 31, 2009 — modified A6, A21 and A22 June 24, 2009 — modified A26 and added Q&amp;A 31-51 May 6, 2009 — posted Q&amp;A 1-30 Q1. Why did the IRS issue internal guidance regarding offshore activities now? A1. The IRS has had a voluntary disclosure practice in its Criminal Manual for many years. Once IRS Criminal Investigation has determined preliminary acceptance into the voluntary disclosure program, the case is referred to the civil side of IRS for examination and resolution of taxes and penalties. Recent IRS enforcement efforts in the offshore area have led to an increased number of voluntary disclosures. Additional taxpayers are considering making voluntary disclosures but are reportedly reluctant to come forward because of uncertainty about the amount of their liability for potentially onerous civil penalties. In order to resolve these cases in an organized, coordinated manner and to make exposure to civil penalties more predictable, the IRS has decided to centralize the civil processing of offshore voluntary disclosures and to offer a uniform penalty structure for taxpayers who voluntarily come forward. These steps were taken to ensure that taxpayers are treated consistently and predictably. Q2. What is the objective of these steps? A2. The objective is to bring taxpayers that have used undisclosed foreign accounts and undisclosed foreign entities to avoid or evade tax into compliance with United States tax laws. Additionally, the information gathered from taxpayers making voluntary disclosures under this practice will be used to further the IRS’s understanding of how foreign accounts and foreign entities are promoted to United States taxpayers as ways to avoid or evade tax. Data gathered will be used in developing additional strategies to inhibit promoters and facilitators from soliciting new clients. Q3. Why should I make a voluntary disclosure? A3. Taxpayers with undisclosed foreign accounts or entities should make a voluntary disclosure because it enables them to become compliant, avoid substantial civil penalties and generally eliminate the risk of criminal prosecution. Making a voluntary disclosure also provides the opportunity to calculate, with a reasonable degree of certainty, the total cost of resolving all offshore tax issues. Taxpayers who do not submit a voluntary disclosure run the risk of detection by the IRS and the imposition of substantial penalties, including the fraud penalty and foreign information return penalties, and an increased risk of criminal prosecution.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345224325259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 13:25:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345224455911-110</Id><Topic><Title>I'M REPUBLICAN....NOT TEA PARTY!</Title><Username>rhonda_evilstein</Username><Timestamp>1345218453164</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:47:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Republicans had two excellent presidents last century Roosevelt and Eisenhower</Msg><Username>hulksweider2000</Username><Timestamp>1345224455911</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 13:27:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345224460353-111</Id><Topic><Title>Romney, Corruption and the End of USA Democracy</Title><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1345223789796</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 13:16:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Romney were in Cuba, he would be facing the firing squard as the leader of the fascist right.

"Thirteen percent. The last time I paid taxes at that rate, I believe I might still have been in college. If not, it was my first couple years as a newspaper reporter." Democrats have repeatedly called on the presumptive GOP presidential nominee to disclose more than the two years of tax records he's pledged to release. Romney has released his 2010 forms and has promised to release his 2011 forms when they are ready. Simon called Romney's refusal to release more of his tax records absurd. "I can’t get over the absurdity of this moment, honestly: Hey, I never paid less than thirteen percent. I swear. And no, you can’t examine my tax returns in any more detail," Simon wrote, in Romney's voice. "But I promise you all, my fellow American citizens, I never once slipped to single digits.

ROMNEY'S jobs FAILURE in Massachusetts Stagnant job growth: During Governor Romney’s term, Massachusetts fell from 36th to 47th out of 50 states in job creation, while the overall U.S. economy was growing. Of the jobs that were created in Massachusetts, state government jobs grew at - six times the rate of private sector jobs under Romney. The U.S. economy was growing in 2001 and creating jobs by July 2003. Romney served during a nationwide economic expansion, and when he took office Massachusetts’ unemployment rate had been below the national average for nearly a decade. But the recovery was slower in Massachusetts: Under Romney, the economy was not at the top or even in the middle, but close to the bottom of all the states. The state lost jobs through the end of 2003, lagging behind the rest of the country by six months. And by the time he left office, the state’s unemployment rate was above the national average. Mitt Romney record as Massachusetts governor will come under scrutiny, including how the state’ economy performed during his administration. Analysis reveals a weak comparative economic performance of the state over the Romney years, one of the worst in the country at the time. Higher taxes: Governor Romney raised taxes and fees on the middle class while cutting taxes for millionaires like himself and 278 of the wealthiest individuals in Massachusetts. Highest debt in the nation: Under Mitt Romney, Massachusetts’ debt burden grew to the highest per person in the nation. Increased government spending: State spending increased every year while Romney was in office, and he left behind a $1 billion deficit for the next governor. Mitt Romney left office without seeking a re-election to Governor of Massachusetts.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1345225941409</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 13:52:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345226121847-122</Id><Topic><Title>63% say release your returns Mitt</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345222649356</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 12:57:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Answer my questions on the looting of Medicare, and the murders of over 200 people.

The Internal Revenue Service said Monday it will extend the deadline, originally set for Wednesday, until Oct. 15. More than 3,000 Americans have applied for the program, which promises no jail time and reduced penalties for tax dodgers who come forward, said a government official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the agency has not publicly released the size of the program. The IRS is extending the deadline to give a rush of applicants more time to prepare their paperwork. The agency said there will be no additional extensions. Tax advisers said the program, combined with a high-profile case against Swiss banking giant UBS AG, has generated a lot of calls from nervous tax dodgers. "They're sitting in disbelief that this is going on," said Richard Boggs, chief executive of Nationwide Tax Relief, a Los-Angeles-based tax firm that specializes in clients with tax debts exceeding $100,000.

Now they’re very upset that the results came back Stupid. ACT, the state’s testing company, interviews professors to figure out the things most important to student readiness for college, which sounds like a smart thing to do. Unfortunately, those professors have bad news: If you want students to do well in biology classes, they have to know about evolution. Rather predictably, the Kentucky GOP is madder than a plumber in a Chipotle. “I think we are very committed to being able to take Kentucky students and put them on a report card beside students across the nation,” said Republican Sen. David Givens. “We’re simply saying to the ACT people we don’t want what is a theory to be taught as a fact in such a way it may damage students’ ability to do critical thinking.” Yes! Let’s teach students about how Chuck E. Cheese made the Earth out of popsicle sticks three years ago. We don’t want to damage them. It gets even better. From the Lexington Herald-Leader: Givens said he asked the ACT representatives about possibly returning to a test personalized for Kentucky, but he was told that option was very expensive and time-consuming. Aw, come on, Smart People. Is that so unreasonable? All Kentucky wants is national guidelines that exempt the state from knowing science, because the best way to prepare students for college classes is obviously to ignore the advice of the people teaching them. Don’t worry, they have a totally real and responsible argument: “The theory of evolution is a theory, and essentially the theory of evolution is not science — Darwin made it up,” [Rep. Ben] Waide said. “My objection is they should ensure whatever scientific material is being put forth as a standard should at least stand up to scientific method. Under the most rudimentary, basic scientific examination, the theory of evolution has never stood up to scientific scrutiny.” See? It’s simple — evolution isn’t real. Not like Jesus! Have you even HEARD of the scientific method, biologists? It’s a little thing where you get evidence for a thing, and continue testing that thing, except in cases where an invisible man made the heavens and the earth, then you have to believe it and definitely teach it as science and DON’T YOU BE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT IT, HEATHEN.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345234933874</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:22:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345235125000-199</Id><Title>CSCO A VALUE BUY I SUPPOSE</Title><Msg>This asked the question, CSCO a value buy or value trap. http://seekingalpha.com/article/795061-cisco-a-value-buy-or-trap</Msg><Username>mnk2012</Username><Timestamp>1345235125000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:25:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345235194000-200</Id><Title>Romney</Title><Msg>Mitt Lotteryticket said "Blind Trusts are an age-old ruse".

On the other hand, the vix is in a downtrend and keeps on hitting new lows (just look at the graph). Two, the vix can go up and the market go up as the correlation (vix up, market down) is not 100%. Now if you are going to be buying stocks in a market with this kind of environment, buying a stock that has been under-appreciated and undervalued, like CSCO makes sense. If the market pulls back, CSCO's relative strength should be stronger and when the market goes for a run up, CSCO should appreciate faster. Even though CSCO ended up going up 0.04, to me it looks like the graph of a stock being sold off. The buyer's basically backed off after the first 5 min. and the profit takers moved in for most of the day. I don't know where the stock is headed next week but today it held up pretty well.</Msg><Username>ahsdn</Username><Timestamp>1345236559912</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:49:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345237009306-206</Id><Topic><Title>I know it is an election year</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1345234472847</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:14:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it hovered at $19 because of options expiration.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1345237009306</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:56:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345237196337-207</Id><Title>Mitt at least release a full years return</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON -- Presidential candidate Mitt Romney's tax returns may be more incomplete in their public release than was previously thought. Filings related to Romney's individual retirement account, already subject to press scrutiny, indicate that the presumptive GOP nominee should have filed a form accounting for unrelated business income taxes. The unrelated business income tax is set up for tax-exempts like nonprofits and IRAs that engage in commercial activity. Not filing the form, known as a 990-T, may indicate that Romney's IRA funds are held by an offshore account in order to shield them from taxation. Romney campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul did not return multiple requests for the 990-T form, nor did she answer repeated questions related to the matter. From what Romney has disclosed, there is mounting circumstantial evidence that the IRA may hold offshore investments through what are known as "blocker corporations," which help him avoid paying taxes. Senator Max Baucus (D-Mont.) told The New York Times, "From what I have read about Governor Romney's tax returns, I think it raises very serious questions." "We know Romney's IRA has Bain funds in it," explained Rebecca J. Wilkins, senior counsel for federal tax policy with the nonpartisan Citizens for Tax Justice. "Bain private equity funds are listed in those assets and those funds are located in the Cayman Islands."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345237196337</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:59:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345237673325-208</Id><Topic><Title>GOP hates science, just to funny</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345234933874</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:22:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I used to own a business in TN let me tell you it's scary how stupid those people are</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345237673325</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:07:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345237708738-209</Id><Topic><Title>See you at $15....again.</Title><Username>jkohl2003</Username><Timestamp>1345234391060</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:13:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well, I didn't expect shorts to start getting desperate till CSCO makes it's next run, but maybe I'm wrong... CSCO was temporarily in a range between 15.90 and 17.55, then it did drop to 15 and looked like the new top of the range would be 16.11 which was broken and a new resistance at 17.79 was going to be made (I might have just expanded the range to 15.90 - 17.79 if I was going to trade within the range) but good news came out and a new range is going to be formed; possibly between 18.48 and 20.10 but it could also go to a range of around 19.27 to 21.10.

George Romney, in his unsuccessful presidential bid. "All the questions you are asking could be answered before the end of the day today, but that will require Governor Romney to live up to a standard that's been met by every other major-party presidential candidate since his father ran for president in 1968," Earnest said. Some Republicans also have called on Romney to release more of his returns, saying the political headache could be easily ended by simply putting out additional information. Romney and his campaign have consistently rebuffed such calls, saying the two years released so far go beyond the legal requirement and offer voters a good perspective into the candidate's financial background. They also say Democrats will launch unfair attacks on any further tax information released by Romney, who is a multimillionaire. Questioned again Thursday about his tax returns, Romney revealed more details than he had previously, telling reporters that he paid no less that 13% of his income in taxes for the past decade while reiterating his refusal to make those returns public. That did not satisfy Obama's senior campaign adviser, David Axelrod. "I don't accept his word on what his taxes say," Axelrod told CNN on Thursday night. "Let the public see it. Let them understand what's in those tax returns. They say, 'well, we don't want to do it because the opposition may make issues about it.' Well, that doesn't give me much confidence about what's in those tax returns."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345237847332</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:10:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345237949918-211</Id><Title>mitt makes Spiro Agnew</Title><Msg>look like a honest man</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345237949918</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:12:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345238160267-212</Id><Title>rage against the Ryan</Title><Msg>Politics makes strange bedfellows, as the saying goes. The latest unlikely couple: GOP congressman and Mitt Romney VP pick Paul Ryan, who says the hardcore rock band Rage Against the Machine is one of his favorites. Rage Against the Machine founder and guitarist Tom Morello is making it clear: that love isn’t mutual. “Paul Ryan’s love of Rage Against the Machine is amusing, because he is the embodiment of the machine that our music has been raging against for two decades,” Morello declares in an op-ed piece for Rolling Stone. Morello continues, “He can like whatever bands he wants, but his guiding vision of shifting revenue more radically to the one percent is antithetical to the message of Rage … Don’t mistake me, I clearly see that Ryan has a whole lotta ‘rage’ in him: A rage against women, a rage against immigrants, a rage against workers, a rage against gays, a rage against the poor, a rage against the environment. Basically the only thing he’s not raging against is the privileged elite he’s groveling in front of for campaign contributions.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345238160267</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:16:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345238617439-213</Id><Topic><Title>an issue that won't go away now will it?</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345237847332</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:10:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could you provide a complete list of every single President over the last 20 years and how many years of tax returns each provided.

We can either continue to support them with unemployment insurance and welfare or we can let them starve, I think throw them out of the life boat, don't let them kill the elderly by taking away their medicare just because they are to lazy to go pick tomatoes.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345251645445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 21:00:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345251831502-243</Id><Topic><Title>We need to be pragmatic</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1345251645445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 21:00:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must have gotten your welfare check today, you're drunk as a skunk already.
