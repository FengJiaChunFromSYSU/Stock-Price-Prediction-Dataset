Any valid question posted to the repuke ticket is ignored. Repukes voting on fairy tales. ROCHESTER, Mich. - Paul Ryan abruptly ended an interview with an ABC affiliate in Flint after the reporter tried to grill the vice presidential candidate on gun violence and tax cuts. "Does the country have a gun problem?" WJRT's Terry Camp asked in a one-on-one interview. "This country has a crime problem," Ryan responded. After the anchor pressed him on whether he thinks the country has a "gun problem," the self-described deer hunter elaborated, "If you take a look at the gun laws we have, I don't even think President Obama is proposing more gun laws. We have good, strong gun laws." Camp challenged him again, and Ryan said, "We have to make sure we enforce our laws. We have lots of laws that aren't being properly enforced. We need to make sure we enforce these laws. But the best thing to help prevent violent crime in the inner cities is to bring opportunity to the inner cities." He credited the work of charities, civic groups, and churches with helping to instill "good discipline, good character" in civil society. In an unlikely turn, the WJRT reporter followed up by asking, "And you can do all that by cutting taxes? With a big tax cut?" "Those are your words, not mine," Ryan responded curtly. His press secretary Michael Steel interrupted from off-camera, "Thank you very much, sir." As Ryan began taking off his mic, he commented, "That was kind of strange, you're trying to stuff words in people's mouths?" Camp replied, "Well, I don't know if it's strange." Ryan disagreed, "Sounds like you're trying to put answers to questions," after which the camera lens is covered in a video that was posted on the affiliate's website but was later removed. Campaign spokesman Brendan Buck characterized Camp's question "weird" and a "strange situation" in which the anchor "embarrassed" himself.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1349758860642</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 01:01:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349760185571-5</Id><Topic><Title>1+ Trillion deficit the year Obama took office. 800,000 jobs lost the month Obama took office</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349746812689</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:40:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey guys if we vote libertarian we can all get along.

From Tom Selkis (Latham Ford) Facebook... True story at the dealership..... "I'll try to make this as short and to the point as I can. One of my salesmen here had a women in his office yesterday wanting to lease a brand new Focus. As he was reviewing her credit app with her he noticed she was on social security disability. He said to her, you don't look like you're disabled and unable to work. She said well I'm really not, I could work if I wanted to but I make more now than I did when I was working and got hurt.(non-disabling injury) She said the gov't sends her 1,500.00 a month in 1 check, she gets 700.00 a month on an EBT card (food stamps), and 800.00 a month for rent. Oh yeah and 250 minutes free on her FREE phone. That is just south of 3,500.00 a month. When she was working she was taking home about 330.00 per week. Do the math and then ask yourself why should she go back to work. If you multiply that by millions of people you start to realize the scope of the problem we face as a country. Once the socialist have 51% of the population in that same scenario we are finished!!!!!!! The question is when do we cross that threshold if we haven't already? She didn't lease the Focus here because the dealer down the road beat our deal by 10.00/month. Glad to know she is so frugal with OUR hard earned money.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1349787552620</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 08:59:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349787662941-24</Id><Title>Hows that $4.89 to over $6 Obama Gas working out for you Obama lovers?</Title><Msg>Hows that $4.89 to over $6 Obama Gas working out for you Obama lovers?

The fact that we are here today to debate raising America 's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government's reckless fiscal policies. Increasing America 's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better.

From "The Blaze" news website: Obama administration bragged about green energy and gave a company named Compact Power $150,000,000 of taxpayer money. "The company, Compact Power, was the recipient of $150 million taxpayer dollars and millions more in tax deferments and credits. Compact Power was supposed to be building thousands of batteries for the Chevy Volt here in America. Instead, they are furloughing workers before producing a single battery, Fox News reports. Not one. It was in 2010 that the Obama administration announced that the government would be awarding $150 million of the $300 million needed to construct the 650,000 square foot plant. Over two years ago, President Obama spoke at the ground breaking ceremony in Holland, Michigan. During his speech to the crowd gathered to declare Michigan to be the “North American Battery Capitol” President Obama told the crowd: “The workers at this plant are already slated to produce batteries for the new Chevy Volt, learned the other day that they’re also going to be supplying batteries for the new electric Ford Focus as soon as this operation gears up. And that means, by 2012, the batteries that will be manufactured here in Holland, Michigan. So when you buy one of these vehicles, the battery could be stamped — made in America.” Initial estimates projected that the facility would be cranking out 15,000 of those “Made In America” Volt batteries each year. Contrary to Mr. Obama’s statement, and despite a $150 million dollar injection of taxpayer dollars, plus millions in tax credits to the company, not one battery for the Chevy Volt has come from the Michigan plant. Currently, all of the Volt batteries are being built in South Korea and shipped to America."</Msg><Username>super_samoann</Username><Timestamp>1349812161428</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 15:49:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349812204733-142</Id><Title>A loving mommy</Title><Msg>As the Obama presidency implodes, Juniors mommy is keeping him away from all sharp instruments.

According to Randolph McTavish, Deputy Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, border patrols are on alert due to an “increase in chatter” indicating that a threat to Canada’s border might be imminent. “We’ve been intercepting troubling comments from some very freaked-out people,” he said. “Most of it has been on NPR call-in shows.” Stating that the R.C.M.P. is patrolling every kilometre of the Canadian border, he issued this warning to Americans who might try to cross into Canada illegally: “If you drive a Prius, you will be stopped.” He also warned Americans against trying to slip across the border in the hopes of passing as Canadians: “It is very difficult, if not impossible, to pretend to like hockey.” Mr. McTavish said that he was sympathetic with those who might flee across the border in search of a new life and socialized medicine, but added, “At the end of the day, forty-seven per cent of Americans is more than Canada can handle.” .</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1349813543646</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:12:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349813563810-153</Id><Title>How many of neocon Mitt's kids serve in Iran and Syria?</Title><Msg>'Nuff said.</Msg><Username>ursofulofkrap</Username><Timestamp>1349813563810</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 16:12:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349813650917-154</Id><Topic><Title>When Bush left DOW = 6K.

If the issue lingers too long Obama will find some lowly scapegoat to pin the blame on and let the guilty shot callers get away with it scott free, just like he and all the democrat operatives in the Dept of Justice let Holder escape justice.</Msg><Username>george_wallace_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1349819633168</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 17:53:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349819697631-181</Id><Topic><Title>HOW MANY CHEVY VOLT BATTERIES DID $150 MILLION IN TAXPAYER MONEY MAKE IN USA</Title><Username>super_samoann</Username><Timestamp>1349812161428</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 15:49:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama admin quietly outsources all the jobs to Asia while at the same time accusing Romney of doing this.</Msg><Username>george_wallace_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1349819697631</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 17:54:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349820303438-182</Id><Topic><Title>SUSPENSE MOUNTS FOR PELOSI, BILL CLINTON, MICHALEL MOORE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE NOMINEES</Title><Username>republicans_rnot_people_persons</Username><Timestamp>1349711740852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 11:55:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody believes that anglo blond hair blue eyed Elizabeth Warren is a native American.

"We're going to crack down on China," he said at a recent event in Ohio. "They've stolen our jobs; that's gotta stop." But according to Romney's recent tax returns, between 2008 and 2011 Romney invested more than a half million dollars in the stocks of 10 Chinese companies—including firms that embezzled, partnered with Iran, and stole US intellectual property. Through Romney's individual and family "blind" trusts—managed by his personal lawyer, R. Bradford Malt—the Romneys traded more than 25,000 shares in Chinese firms, including some based in Hong Kong. Some of these investments have previously been reported in the media and raised by the Obama campaign, but others have gone unnoticed. Overall, the stock investments netted the Romneys a profit of more than $90,000 in 2010 and 2011. (Some of the individual investments were losers.) While that sum is a pittance in light of the candidate's vast personal wealth, it represents a significant amount for ordinary working Americans.
