While the state dropped the charges, the fact remains that Romney was put into handcuffs and taken in. While on a family summer vacation in 1981 Mitt Romney at was Lake Cochituate, an hour or so outside of Boston. He was just about to launch his boat when a park officer told him not to. The reason? His license looked painted over. The officer told Mr Romney that if he launched the boat, he’d receive a fifty dollar fine. Romney waited until the officer left and launched the boat anyway. The officer returned just as Mitt Romney was launching the boat, and was visibly angry and placed Mitt–still in a bathing suit–in cuffs and took him in to be booked. The charges were dropped several days later because of Romney’s argument that it wasn’t a valid arrest because he “wasn’t being disorderly.” Directly disobeying the law is orderly as long as you’re entitled to be above the law, I suppose.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345956045530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 00:40:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345956067750-3</Id><Topic><Title>WILL THE ALMIGHTY SEND AN EARTHQUAKE TO DESTROY THE DEM</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1345916056144</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 13:34:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>either that or they will just infect each other with AIDS or other STDS and do it themselves...thankfully the demented sick perverts are self-destructive, "maintenance free" if you will.</Msg><Username>rationalthoughtll</Username><Timestamp>1345956067750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 00:41:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345956776584-4</Id><Title>WHAT HAS OBAMA ACCOMPLISHED OTHER THAN 9% UNEMPLOYMENT, A FAILED</Title><Msg>RECOVERY, MULTIPLE TRILLIONS OF NEW DEBT---ALL IN 3 1/2 YEARS!

You have already rated this item,Thank you for your support. Topics: Smoking, Dorking, Zoo, performance enhancing drugs, baboons Wednesday, 23 May 2012 Baboon fur: Smoke it if you got it. Dorking Zoo Keeper, Stavros Jones, improved his brainpower three-fold by smoking the malted fur from various primates at the zoo he is employed at an un-named conservation park in Surrey. Stavros, a keen botanist when not tending to primates, boasts an already increased knowledge of exotic herbs, noted one of his captive chimpanzees savouring the aroma of its pelt during one of his frequent shifts and decided to take some action for himself. Rolling some spent fur in his token tool of choice, Rizza(TM), he then spent the next several weeks participating in the heady delights of primate fuzz under the watchful eye of his furry counterparts. Initially only partaking the inhalation as way to get back to nature after years of searching for the all time high as he refers to it, Mr. Jones then became privy to the complex computations of quantum-physics and string theory. According to Jones, he doesn't remember much of the fur high, but he stated that after an eighteen hour bender on suffused cercopithecidea fur he felt more intelligent. Since then he has gone on to write several papers that reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, introduced the entire monkey population at the reserve to the intricacy of hair-dressing instead of self grooming, and is now dating famous party girl/super model Kate Moss who is trying to formulate a powdered fur for medicinal purposes only. "It's not continuous effort that unlocks our potential. It's smoking baboon fur. Churchill had it wrong all along," said Jones as he lit up his Rizza</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1345987675433</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 09:27:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345994893357-10</Id><Title>CRYPTKeeper Jan Brewer at Tampa GOP Clown Circus</Title><Msg>CRYPTKeeper gonna speak about how to keep a clean CRYPT for GOP clowns.</Msg><Username>gop_clown_circus</Username><Timestamp>1345994893357</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 11:28:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345995100565-11</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY ARRESTED...ENTITLED LITTLE BRAT !!!</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345956045530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 00:40:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOP clowns are ABOVE the laws for little people just like the GOP clowns do not pay taxes like the little people do.</Msg><Username>gop_clown_circus</Username><Timestamp>1345995100565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 11:31:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345995261415-12</Id><Title>If You Are NOT a Rich Billionaire, then You Are a Clown to Vote GOP</Title><Msg>Everybody loves the GOP Clown Circus.</Msg><Username>gop_clown_circus</Username><Timestamp>1345995261415</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 11:34:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345996048508-13</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY ARRESTED...ENTITLED LITTLE BRAT !!!</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1345956045530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 00:40:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Congrats, BOYsurfer, you just made #1 who fuggin cares idiot of the day.

They don't get their answers on climate change from climatologists, they get them from the Book of Genesis. Hence Sharia Law in America is a dire threat, and global warming a hoax. Or take the issue that consumes the right these days, our sea of red ink: Republicans are united in their fervent desire to reduce the deficit, but they want to do it in some magical fashion that doesn't involve raising taxes or cutting any spending. When given a choice in polls between these two options, a majority of Republicans check "none of the above" as a way to reduce the deficit. That's like deciding to pay off your student loans by daydreaming. Or as it's known on Capitol Hill, supply-side economics. Remember that magic beans theory? That you actually bring in more revenue by bringing in less? Ronald Reagan believed it. But at least back in the '80s it was new. The thing is, we tried it, and it doesn't work. Yet, Paul Ryan, who every #$%$for-brains pundit in America keeps telling us is a "serious" guy, still believes in the supply-side theory. All the Republicans do.

LOL FMR GOV. JEB BUSH: I think it's time for him to move on. I mean, he-- look, the guy was dealt a difficult hand. No question about it. But he's had three years. His policies have failed. And rather than blame others which-- I know we were taught that that was kind of unbecoming overtime, you just can't keep doing that. Maybe offer some fresh, new solutions to the problems that we face. Obama does not always mention Bush by name, but a frequent theme of his campaign strategy is to say that a Republican administration under Mitt Romney will emulate the "same failed policies" of the "past decade," much of the time Bush was in office. Despite Jeb Bush's insistence, though, it's likely that Obama will continue the strategy through the election. That's because, despite frequent Republican complaints, polls show that voters still put more blame on Bush than they do Obama. A recent Pew Research Center report found that 44 percent of those surveyed blamed Bush "a lot" for the middle class' economic woes over the past decade, compared to 34 percent who said the same about Obama.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346027417441</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:30:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346027476490-63</Id><Topic><Title>hello McFly</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346027417441</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:30:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it's good Jeb keeps his brothers fault in the press, it helps Obama</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346027476490</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:31:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346027492032-64</Id><Topic><Title>did W do more cocaine then Obama</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346025156908</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 19:52:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's not expensive if you are selling to the other kids like Obama did.

Rhonda must be so proud!! MORE THAN 30 former Israeli soldiers have disclosed their experiences of the treatment of Palestinian children during military operations and arrests, pointing to a pattern of abuse. A booklet of testimonies, published by Breaking the Silence, an organisation of former Israeli soldiers dedicated to publicising the day-to-day actions of the army in the occupied territories, contains descriptions of beatings, intimidation, humiliation, verbal abuse, night-time arrests and injury. Most of the children are suspected of stone-throwing. The witness statements were gathered to show the “common reality” of acts of violence by soldiers towards Palestinians, including children, in the West Bank, said Yehuda Shaul of Breaking the Silence. “Sadly enough this is the moral consequence of prolonged occupation of the Palestinian people,” he said. One of the ex-soldiers describes serving in Hebron in 2010: “You never know their names, you never talk with them, they always cry, #$%$ in their pants. There are those annoying moments when you’re on an arrest mission, and there’s no room in the police station, so you just take the kid back with you, blindfold him, put him in a room and wait for the police to come and pick him up in the morning. He sits there like a dog.” Children frequently soiled themselves, according to the testimonies. “I remember hearing him #$%$ting his pants. I also remember some other time when someone #$%$ in his pants. I just became so indifferent to it, I couldn’t care less. I heard him do it, I witnessed his embarrassment. I also smelled it. But I didn’t care,” said another.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346028983222</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:56:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346029027528-81</Id><Topic><Title>Romney didn't pay taxes on the Swiss Bank accounts</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346027042058</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:24:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I only pay as much as I'm required, but I don't think that is the point!

By Joseph E. Stiglitz and Linda J. Bilmes Sunday, September 5, 2010 Writing in these pages in early 2008, we put the total cost to the United States of the Iraq war at $3 trillion. This price tag dwarfed previous estimates, including the Bush administration's 2003 projections of a $50 billion to $60 billion war. But today, as the United States ends combat in Iraq, it appears that our $3 trillion estimate (which accounted for both government expenses and the war's broader impact on the U.S. economy) was, if anything, too low. For example, the cost of diagnosing, treating and compensating disabled veterans has proved higher than we expected.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346030635686</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 21:23:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346030796605-100</Id><Topic><Title>Romney was learning French instead of going to Vietnam</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346029277295</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 21:01:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes, ALL phonies and cowards! and these are the people representing us!</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346030796605</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 21:26:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346030826760-101</Id><Topic><Title>remember when Trump told us</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346030170681</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 21:16:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe the big surprise was that he was going to switch the rag he passes for hair.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346030826760</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 21:27:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346031009577-102</Id><Topic><Title>Did Obama really do COCAINE</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1346004337879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 14:05:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dear BOYsurfer, Don't know what my wife has to do with anything but she was killed in a car accident 12 years ago.

I spoke out against Bush when the war criminals were calling me unpatriotic. I also spoke out against the trillions Bush wasted during his 8 years in office. did you? When Bush took office, we were 4 trillion in debt. when he left, 11 trillion. do you realize that? Moreover, I ALSO have a big problem with Obama spending money that we don't have. I sent him e-mails telling him to stop putting our country in more debt. He needs to raise the taxes on the rich and cut the spending. He needs to do that next year, and he will do that next year. There were 40,000+ soldiers injured in Iraq. These people will get medical help for decades. Do you know how much a doctor's visit costs? When all is said and done, the Iraq war will cost more than 2 trillion dollars! The Afghanistan war was justified, our involvement in Libya was smart. The Russians could not win in Afghanistan and neither will Obama. Remember, I'm an Independent. I could care less about the democratic party. In 2016, I would like to see a viable Independent party run and win. Romney has no chance in 2012. Any American voting for someone with Swiss Bank accounts, businesses in Bermuda, and in charge of companies that have outsourced our jobs overseas, should have their head examined.</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346032660749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 21:57:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346032995255-110</Id><Topic><Title>23 MILLION unemployed Americans</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1346031189989</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 21:33:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes, the hole Bush put us in was THAT LARGE! and, if you think McCain could have done better than you probably did a line with Obama</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346032995255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:03:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346033458448-111</Id><Topic><Title>Romney didn't pay taxes on the Swiss Bank accounts</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346027042058</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 20:24:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You should learn how to research FACTS.

I can tell you are narrow minded and full of Hatred for Bush, History will show him as one of the greatest Presidents we ever had.
