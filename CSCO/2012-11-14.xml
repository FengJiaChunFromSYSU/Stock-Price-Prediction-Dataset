Though none has come even close to Texas' number, many petitions -- including those of Georgia, Florida, Alabama and Tennessee -- have attracted more than 20,000 supporters. Louisiana's petition has garnered more than 30,000 signatures. “As the economy worsened, people began to ask, ‘What if? Why do we need the middle man? Do we believe that we should have more layers of government than we absolutely need? Could Texas govern itself?’ I think really that self-determination is kind of the underpinning to all of this -- the ability to provide Texas solutions to Texas problems,” Miller told Politico of the state's aspirations for independence.</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1352891288769</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 06:08:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352891667873-15</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like Wash DC will be a state after all, maybe even the only ONE, or CA can be part of MexiHole afterall.</Title><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1352891288769</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 06:08:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's soon OVER for the LIB-A-Nazzi's</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1352891667873</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 06:14:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352891908089-16</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like Wash DC will be a state after all, maybe even the only ONE, or CA can be part of MexiHole afterall.</Title><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1352891288769</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 06:08:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While your SCAMMER POTUS tries to create massive govt dependence, it turns out to be MASSIVE independence.

If you still have a wife, you must got her hoodwinked or she has a low self-esteem.</Msg><Username>bananas500</Username><Timestamp>1352904306332</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 09:45:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352904887831-80</Id><Topic><Title>Remember the polls are skewed, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1352902462317</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 09:14:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney to win with a 53-47 landslide, LOL (oh yeah and there is no global warming either). Polling firms continue to oversample Democrats by preposterous margins to deliver polls reflecting President Obama ahead of Governor Romney in battleground states. Therefore, when his complicit media lapdogs gleefully report the top-line result, it can be quite demoralizing to voters wanting a better path for America. But when you dig into the poll numbers themselves, the president really is in dire straits -- even within his own party. Therefore, the polling institutions wanting a positive Obama-result have no choice but to find a few more Democrats willing to vote for the guy. So if they can prevent just a handful of Romney voters from turning out on Election Day, maybe Obama's would-be losses in these various states will be less embarrassing. Take the latest poll coming out of Iowa, for example. It was conducted by the Des Moines Register and now sits atop the other Iowa polls over at Real Clear Politics. It claims Obama is now leading Romney by 47-42. This means that 11 percent are undecided. If you follow the logic of Dick Morris -- that undecided voters always vote against the embattled incumbent -- the actual result is 53-47 for Romney thereby giving the Governor the state's electoral votes. But it doesn't stop there. In fact, if you read the findings within the poll, coupled with the average turnout of Iowa voters from 2000, 2004, and 2008 of 1,426,021 voters, you come to numbers which are very close to the 53-47.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1352904887831</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 09:54:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352905161074-81</Id><Title>Will close red..closing all positions...</Title><Msg>CSCO never carried the market.</Msg><Username>checking_here</Username><Timestamp>1352905161074</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 09:59:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352905243834-82</Id><Title>GOP Clown Circus Polls Said to Heavily Short CSCO at $16.78</Title><Msg>Wrong AGAIN.</Msg><Username>gop_clown_circus</Username><Timestamp>1352905243834</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 10:00:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352905304846-83</Id><Title>The Sell orders are massive!</Title><Msg>The writing of calls are massive.

Hundreds of flights were cancelled, schools were shut, factories were at a standstill and trains barely ran in Spain and Portugal where unions held their first joint general strike. Stoppages in Belgium interrupted international rail services.

Workers also protested in Greece and France against austerity policies that have taken a heavy economic toll and aggravated mass unemployment. But the demonstrations organized by the European Trade Union Confederation seemed unlikely to force hard-pressed governments to change their cost-cutting strategies. Wealthier nations like Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark saw only small, sedate demonstrations. Governments backing the line of stringent austerity were not impressed by the show of force. The European Trade Union Confederation’s website features a Google map showing all the different locations where protests were taking place across Europe Wednesday. Click on this image to visit the site. “We must nevertheless do what is necessary: break open encrusted labour markets, give more people a chance to work, become more flexible in many areas,” German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. “We will of course make this clear, again and again, in talks with the unions.” Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos spoke of “a long crisis that has meant sacrifice and uncertainty,” but said: “The government is convinced that the path we have taken is the only possible way out.” In Spain, 110 people were arrested – including two allegedly with material to make explosives – after confrontations at picket lines and damage to storefronts. Riot police fired rubber bullets at protesters in central Madrid in one brief clash. Even non-union workers jointed protests and marches. “This isn’t about politics or unions. This is social and economic. If we have to shut down the country we’ll shut it down,” said 24-year-old Mariluz Gordillo, a non-unionized phone operator at El Corte Ingles department store. In Rome scuffles broke out between police in riot gear and demonstrators who threw stones, bottles and fireworks at police. About 60 demonstrators were detained. Protesters occupied Pisa’s mediaeval leaning tower for an hour, hanging a banner reading “Rise up. We are not paying for your crisis.” AP Photo/Matt DunhamPolice officers try to push protesters back onto the pavement after they blocked traffic on Oxford Street, London, in a protest held to coincide with planned European strikes on Wednesday in Spain, Italy, Greece, Portugal, France and Belgium against austerity measures and economic reforms. DEEPENING RECESSION In Portugal and Greece – both rescued with European funds and under strict austerity programs – the economic downturn sharpened in the third quarter, data showed in Wednesday. Things have to change… Money has ended up with all the power and people none. How could this happen? Portuguese unemployment jumped to a record 15.8% while in neighbouring Spain, one in four of the workforce is jobless. Greece’s economic output shrank 7.2% on an annual basis in the third quarter as the debt-laden country staggers towards its sixth year of depression. Close to 26 million people are unemployed in the European Union while governments take aim at spending on treasured universal health care and public schools. “Things have to change… Money has ended up with all the power and people none. How could this happen?” said Esteban Quesada, 58, a hardware store owner in Barcelona who closed his shop to join the protests in Spain’s second city. Throughout southern Europe governments are trying to put public finances back on track after years of overspending. Portugal and Greece have cut pensions and, with Spain, have slashed public sector wages as well as spending on hospitals and schools. Italy and France are also under pressure to control their budget deficits. EU Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn praised Spain on Wednesday for making progress in trimming its budget but acknowledged many Spaniards are struggling.

In Spain, most of the savings have been gobbled up by higher interest payments on the national debt, swollen by the cost of rescuing banks after a real estate bubble burst in 2008. Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank, said in a report on Wednesday that the eurozone debt crisis is still the number one risk to German banks and insurers, and the situation had not improved from last year. Promises from the European Central Bank to support sovereign bond prices for countries that seek aid have brought some relief to Spain and Italy in the capital markets. On Wednesday Italy sold 3-year bonds at the lowest borrowing cost in two years. SPAIN TO STAY THE COURSE While several southern European countries have seen bursts of violence, a coordinated and effective regional protest against austerity has yet to force a significant policy shift. Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told reporters on Wednesday the government would stay the course with spending cuts to meet ambitious deficit cutting targets, despite the strike. “We’re on strike to stop these suicidal policies,” said Candido Mendez, head of Spain’s second-biggest labor federation, the General Workers’ Union, or UGT. Union leaders in Spain said more than 9 million workers joined the strike – the second this year. The government said participation was much lower and played down the impact, saying many services were functioning normally. Stores opened normally in many parts of the country, though some had protesters outside. About 5 million people, or 22% of the workforce, are union members in Spain. In Portugal about a quarter of the 5.5 million strong workforce is unionized. Passions were inflamed when a Spanish woman jumped to her death last week as bailiffs tried to evict her from her home. Spaniards are furious at banks being rescued with public money while ordinary people suffer. In Portugal, which took an EU bailout last year, public and political opposition to austerity is growing, threatening to derail measures sought by Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho.

David Ramos/Getty ImagesA demonstrator throws a stone at a convoy of trucks as they leave Mercabarna, the biggest wholesale market in the city, late Tuesday in Barcelona, Spain during a 24-hour general strike. Passos Coelho’s policies were held up this week as a model by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is despised in much of southern Europe for taking a hard line on the conditions attached to EU aid. Inspectors from the “troika” of the International Monetary Fund, ECB and European Commission – who monitor implementation of the conditions – also drew the protesters’ anger. In Lisbon, thousands filled a square in front of the Portuguese parliament shouting “This debt is not ours” and “Out IMF, out troika”. Police were guarding the building. “I’m on strike because those who work are basically being blackmailed into sacrificing more and more in the name of debt reduction, which is a big lie,” said Daniel Santos de Jesus, 43, who teaches architecture at the Lisbon Technical University. Major demonstrations were planned for the evening in Madrid, Lisbon, Barcelona and other cities. GLUED UP Protesters jammed cash machines with glue and coins, and plastered anti-government stickers on shop windows around Spain. Power consumption dropped 16% with factories idled. More than 600 flights were cancelled in Spain alone, mainly by Iberia and budget carrier Vueling. Portugal’s flag carrier TAP cancelled roughly 45% of flights. In Greece, which saw a big two-day strike last week as parliament voted to approve new cuts, hundreds of strikers rallied peacefully in central Athens, holding aloft giant Italian, Portuguese and Spanish flags and banners proclaiming “Enough is enough.” In France, five trade unions organized marches in more than 100 cities but did not call for a strike. Left-wing critics of Socialist President Francois Hollande said he has failed to address the concerns of French workers who have the same fears as their counterparts in southern Europe. “It’s an unconditional surrender,” hard left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said on France 2 television.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352922740159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 14:52:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352922879123-209</Id><Topic><Title>Riots, strikes, and protests across Eurozone, Obama wants lead us like Europe God Help US.</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352922740159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 14:52:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Blue Parasites don't have time to work, but they can usually fit a little rioting, looting and pillaging in between heavy malt liquor intake and bong hits.....</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1352922879123</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 14:54:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352922912765-210</Id><Topic><Title>BFG cuts CSCO to SELL.

And it’s been happening for, like, 11 years.” Sources confirmed that after reading a few paragraphs about the brutal war, the nation quickly became distracted by a headline about Elmo puppeteer Kevin Clash’s alleged sexual abuse of a 16-year-old boy.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1352923014427</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 14:56:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352923130278-212</Id><Topic><Title>Riots, strikes, and protests across Eurozone, Obama wants lead us like Europe God Help US.</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352922740159</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 14:52:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>liberals dont want you to eat trans fats and drink to much soda but pot is ok.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1352923130278</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 14:58:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352923139580-213</Id><Topic><Title>IN NOT TOO MANY YEARS, DEMOCRATS MAY NO LONGER SMILE, OR EVEN BE SEEN IN PUBLIC</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1352918810864</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 13:46:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In this last election, the American electorate dumped Walter out of his big 'ol Texas wheelchair, stomped on his framed picture of Mitch McTurtle, and doodooed on his precious Donald Trump wig.

It’s more about memories and moments ... and lots of home renovations. A new study from Spectrem Group, the Lake Forest, Ill.-based research group, shows that people with a net worth of $25 million spend far more on vacations and home renovations than they do on clothing, cars, and jewelry. The survey showed that nearly half of the respondents spent more than $25,000 a year on vacations or leisure travel. More than a third spent more than $25,000 on home improvements. Vacations and home improvement were among the top categories for the spending of the ultra-wealthy. Lower on the list was jewelry (58 percent spent less than $10,000 a year), autos (44 percent spent less than $10,000), and clothing (53 percent spent less than $10,000). Robert Frank CNBC Reporter &amp; Editor “The data tells us that there are very few people in this group who are really flamboyant in how they spend their money,” said George Walper, president of Spectrem. Of course, just because a couple spends $30,000 for luxury tents and chef-prepared meals in the Okavango Delta doesn’t mean they are not extravagant. It’s just that they’re “experience extravagant,” rather than “material extravagant.” (Read More: 5 Top Trophy Properties in Europe.) Still, the spending of the wealthy has taken on a slightly different character since the bling-filled years of 2005-2007. Aside from spending more on vacations and home improvements, they're also spending more on entertainment and the arts. Today, a third of the ultra-rich are spending $25,000 or more a year on the arts.

Bush started torturing people, including American citizens and surrendered America's moral superiority. He destroyed the U.S. banking system throwing millions of people out of their homes.

In Lisbon, protesters tore down the barricades surrounding the Portuguese parliament, as a day of peaceful protests turned violent as night fell. Riot police stepped in to make a human barrier outside the parliament as they faced off against the advancing demonstrators. Allegedly pelted with rocks and bottles by some of the protesters the police later charged forward from the parliament steps lashing out with their batons. At least five people were injured and one arrested. The police charge dispersed the protesters who fled into narrow side-streets and set fire to rubbish bins. There were also fresh clashes in Barcelona, Spain, late on Wednesday with police using batons and reportedly rubber bullets to disperse the huge numbers of protesters that had thronged the streets. While in Madrid, tension was high as a march drew tens of thousands of people into the centre of the Spanish capital and a huge crowd gathered outside the parliament building. Riot police stood guard behind a series of barriers protecting the parliament. Earlier clashes in Madrid had seen 118 people arrested on Wednesday and 74 people, including 43 police, injured.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352939730973</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 19:35:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352939829734-333</Id><Topic><Title>Euro violence continues into the night</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352939730973</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 19:35:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama want us to have Euro socialist policies, your looking at our future in 2 to 3 years</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352939829734</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 19:37:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352939837251-334</Id><Title>Boehner Rejects Obama’s Request to Extend Middle Class Tax Cut</Title><Msg>great John raise taxes on the 98% to defend the 2%, see how many votes that gets for you baggers</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1352939837251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 19:37:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352939906836-335</Id><Topic><Title>all the buyers last night $18+ got skunked today</Title><Username>bigfatty_guns</Username><Timestamp>1352935827884</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 18:30:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good point</Msg><Username>christmasfern</Username><Timestamp>1352939906836</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 19:38:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352939963916-336</Id><Title>proof Darwin was right</Title><Msg>Florida man who warned he wouldn't 'be around' if Barack Obama was reelected kills himself after the election</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1352939963916</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 19:39:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352940265449-337</Id><Topic><Title>Remember when Bush refused to testify in front of the 9-11 commission if he had to do it under oath?</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1352937245810</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 18:54:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most of your post was a lie,dum dum.

Women now have majorities in law schools, and medical schools. They also form the majority of the electorate, and many believe are smarter than men. Questions of marital affairs, and sexual issues in general dominate the news. The lost of Petraeus is a major blow to the intelligence community, and to military morale.
