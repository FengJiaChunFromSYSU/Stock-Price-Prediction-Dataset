Ford, a Chicago Democrat, allegedly fraudulently netted a $500,000 increase and a two-year extension on a line of credit from ShoreBank, reports the Sun-Times. The bank, which according to the Tribune primarily lent to South and West Side residents in Chicago, failed in 2010.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1354251795653</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 00:03:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354252719216-2</Id><Topic><Title>Great day in history!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354227045757</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 17:10:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed- Great editorial in the Toronto Sun regarding this.

Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg, a member of the governing Socialist party, caused controversy last week when he said that the Indian company, which employs close to 20,000 people in France, should leave after it said it would have to close down a factory. The French government announced on Thursday that it could nationalize the factory in question, with backing from an unnamed businessman. The news raised the specter of the nationalizations of the early 1980s, which were instigated by Hollande’s predecessor Francois Mitterrand. Montebourg told CNBC after a meeting with trade unions in Paris: “Barack Obama's nationalized. The Germans are nationalizing. All countries are nationalizing. I've also noticed the British nationalized 6 banks.” Americans don't study geography. Obama is a Keynesian not a Kenyan.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1354284538615</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 09:08:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354286053567-18</Id><Topic><Title>$19 could now be SUPPORT</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1354282081876</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 08:28:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As a long term bag holder, I think there is good upside to hit 23-25 sometime next year, where I will dump all of it.</Msg><Username>smathan75</Username><Timestamp>1354286053567</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 09:34:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354286106811-19</Id><Topic><Title>332 - 206 --- THAT's what America said.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1354284868348</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 09:14:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bush staked his claim to a broad mandate and announced his top priorities at a post-election news conference, saying his 3.5 million vote victory had won him political capital that he would spend enacting his conservative agenda.

Here’s an analysis from one senior Republican aide, as relayed to ABC News’ Jonathan Karl: The White House keeps saying it wants a ‘balanced approach’ but this offer is completely unbalanced and unrealistic. It calls for $1.6 trillion in tax hikes – all of that upfront – in exchange for only $400 billion in spending cuts that come later. Plus, the only entitlement changes they proposed come from the exact proposals in the President’s budget. The trouble with this analysis is that it ignores history: As part of the 2011 Budget Control Act, Obama agreed to spending reductions of about $1.5 trillion over the next ten years. If you count the interest, the savings is actually $1.7 trillion. Boehner should have no problem remembering the details of that deal: As Greg Sargent points out, Boehner at the time actually gloated about the fact that the deal was "all spending cuts." And now, with this latest offer, Obama is proposing yet more spending reductions, to the tune of several hundred billion dollars. Add it up and it’s more than $2 trillion in spending cuts Obama has either signed into law or is endorsing now.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354287165209</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 09:52:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354287301779-27</Id><Topic><Title>$19 could now be SUPPORT</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1354282081876</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 08:28:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You missed the boat.

To date, it is believed that ice-sheet melt has only added about half an inch to rising sea levels. But the quicker pace of melting, particularly in Greenland, now has ice scientists worried. New research published in the journal Science concludes that Antarctica is melting, but points to the smaller ice sheet in Greenland, which covers most of the island, as the more critical issue. Its melt rate has grown from about 55 billion tons a year in the 1990s to almost 290 billion tons a year recently, according to the study. "Greenland is really taking off," said the study's co-author Ted Scambos, lead scientist at Boulder's National Snow and Ice Data Center, which is part of the University of Colorado. "In Greenland, the melt was so severe that it took away the very instruments we used to measure the ice sheet," Scambos added. "Many instruments were melted out and toppled over because melt proceeded to a level we have never seen before." The work of the NSIDC also made waves Thursday on the other side of the world. It was reported at the U.N. climate talks in the Qatari capital of Doha that, based on data supplied by Boulder researchers, an area of Arctic sea ice larger than the United States melted this year. The dramatic record-low reading of Arctic sea ice documented in the U.N. report prompted the World Meteorological Organization to declare climate change is happening "before our eyes."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354290626663</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 10:50:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354290729758-38</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO take a clutch of all to go onward on - rudely active takings</Title><Username>marjorie.carrillo45</Username><Timestamp>1353606548797</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-22 12:49:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for this awesome report!</Msg><Username>ralphsolo409</Username><Timestamp>1354290729758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 10:52:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354290796131-39</Id><Topic><Title>inconvenient truth</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354290626663</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 10:50:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WRONG WRONG WRONG......The antarctic ice is EXPANDING while the artic ice is melting.

'Father', he confessed, 'it has been one month since my last confession. I had sex with Nookie Green twice last month.' The priest told the sinner, 'You are forgiven. Go out and say three Hail Mary's.' Soon thereafter, another Irish man entered the confessional. 'Father, it has been two months since my last confession. I've had sex with Nookie Green twice a week for the past two months.' This time, the priest questioned, 'Who is this Nookie Green?' 'A new woman in the neighborhood,' the sinner replied. 'Very well,' sighed the priest. Go and say ten Hail Mary's.; At mass the next morning, as the priest prepared to deliver the sermon, a tall, voluptuous, drop-dead gorgeous redheaded woman entered the sanctuary. The eyes of every man in the church fell upon her as she slowly sashayed up the aisle and sat down right in front of the priest. Her dress was green and very short, and she wore matching, shiny emerald-green shoes. The priest and the altar boy gasped as the woman in the green dress and matching green shoes sat with her legs spread slightly apart, but just enough to realize she wasn't wearing any underwear. The priest turned to the altar boy and whispered, 'Is that Nookie Green?' The bug-eyed altar boy couldn't believe his ears but managed to calmly reply, 'No Father, I think it's just a reflection from her shoes'..</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1354291855440</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 11:10:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354292167765-45</Id><Title>fiscal cliff is a lot of #$%$</Title><Msg>If spending cuts and tax increases kick in due to so-called "fiscal cliff" happening, the only party that will suffer is China, as USA runs deficits year in and year out to fund consumption of goods made in China.

It seems to pile up in new places, as if the snow was falling from the sky. The most rational arguments against "Global Warming" is that it might not be "Man caused" and that the earth can mitigate the consequences and rejuvenate. Tons of space dust hits the planet every year, but you don't hear a lot about the problems of a growing planet, which goes further away from the sun due to centripital force. You don't hear about all of the Carbon which escapes the atmosphere annually due to creation of methane gas. These idiots think that methan reamains on the planet when it gasses off. They want us to believe that the methane on the moons of saturn was created by some yet unknown process, while tons of methane gasses off the earth naturally, every year, and becomes frozen space dust until it is attracted to a warmer planet.

"This improved certainty allows us to say definitively that both Antarctica and Greenland have been losing ice," lead author Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds in Britain, told reporters. Not only that, but the pace has tripled from the 1990s, the data indicate. Combining satellite data from dozens of earlier studies, the study "shows that the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets have contributed just over 11 millimeters (0.4 inches) to global sea levels since 1992," he added. Two-thirds was from Greenland, a third from Antarctica. NASA Earth Observatory This 20-mile-long rift on Antarctica's Pine Island Glacier, seen from a satellite on Oct. 26, will eventually calve off, possibly in the next few months, creating an iceberg the size of New York City. While that won't raise sea levels since the glacial tongue sits on water, the loss could speed up the flow of ice from Antarctica's mainland into the sea. That's 20 percent of all sea level rise over the last two decades, with the rest mostly from thermal expansion of waters due to warming sea temperatures, the authors noted. In recent years, however, the percentage "has gone up significantly" to nearly 40 percent, added co-author Michiel van den Broeke from Utrecht University in the Netherlands.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354293444723</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 11:37:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354293485486-56</Id><Topic><Title>Karl Marx said "Before you become a Communist, you begin as a socialist".

Education figures prominently in the report's ranking of states, which also looks at fiscal stability, debt levels, economic opportunity and health and wellness. The five states that ranked highest -- Virginia (#1), Minnesota (#2), New Hampshire (#3), Utah (#4), and Massachusetts (#5) -- all stressed education, says Bagby. The states that scored the lowest -- Mississippi (#50), Nevada (#49), Louisiana (#48), West Virginia (#47), and Alabama (#46) -- did not. This study fails to account for the fact that those states that scored the lowest are full of bagger #$%$ that are not intelligent enough to educate.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354295029031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 12:03:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354295048845-70</Id><Title>The DISHONESTY of leftists...I mean "Democrats" For example..You mention a FACT that they cannot explain</Title><Msg>so, they say nothing (Or try the old low grade insult).....like when Obama stated that "..I want to fundamentally change America..."

Rising seas would increase the risk of catastrophic flooding like that caused by Hurricane Sandy last month in New York and New Jersey. Environmental damage may include widespread erosion, contamination of aquifers and crops, and harm to marine life. And in the long term, rising seas may force hundreds of millions of people who live along the coast to abandon their homes. By reconciling nearly two decades of often conflicting satellite data into one format—in other words, comparing apples to apples—the new study, published in the journal Science, made a more confident estimate of what's called ice sheet mass balance. That refers to how much snow is deposited on an ice sheet versus how much is lost, either due to surface melting or ice breaking off glaciers. Between 1992—when polar satellite measurements began—and 2011, the results show that all of the polar regions except for East Antarctica are losing ice, said study leader Andrew Shepherd, a professor of earth observation at the University of Leeds in the U.K. In that 20-year span, Greenland lost 152 billion tons a year of ice, West Antarctica lost 65 billion tons a year, the Antarctic Peninsula lost 20 billion tons a year, and East Antarctica gained 14 billion tons a year.

So POTUS should be aware: "Unlawful combatants are likewise subject to capture and detention, but in addition they are subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals for acts which render their belligerency unlawful. The spy who secretly and without uniform passes the military lines of a belligerent in time of war, seeking to gather military information and communicate it to the enemy, or an enemy combatant who without uniform comes secretly through the lines for the purpose of waging war by destruction of life or property, are familiar examples of belligerents who are generally deemed not to be entitled to the status of prisoners of war, but to be offenders against the law of war subject to trial and punishment by military tribunals" The default position of the GC, is that all prisoners are to be accorded the benefit of the laws of the captor. The laws of the United States allow, but do not require, a military court. Note that the offenders are violators of the "law of war," so it only makes sense that military justice prevail.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354304308636</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 14:38:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354304684337-128</Id><Topic><Title>Facts are facts.

To offset that lost revenue, Ryan also has proposed spending $5.3 trillion less over the same time period, but has not specified exact cuts. Ryan's budget would slash all federal spending -- outside of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security -- by 70 percent by 2050, perhaps an unrealistic assumption considering that Romney has promised to keep defense spending above those levels, according to Washington Post columnist Ezra Klein.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354305596168</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 14:59:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354305638557-134</Id><Topic><Title>I trust Obama the same way that I would trust Hitler.

Neither side has offered up a plan that comes close to what could realistically pass both houses of Congress. Boehner, in fact, has offered no plan at all: When he is pressed by reporters on his position, he says to look to the House Republican budgets to understand what his side is seeking. When Rep. Tiberi, R-Ohio, was asked about the apparent lack of a GOP "fiscal cliff" offer on Medicare, he responded, "we passed a Medicare plan in our budget." Republicans are thus arguing that the controversial budgets spearheaded by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisc., are effectively their proposal. And the Ryan budget, with its deep cuts to entitlements and other spending, has the same chance of getting through the Senate as the Obama proposal has getting through the House: Zero. If the Obama proposal is a "joke," then the Republican proposal is the exact same joke.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1354311519098</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 16:38:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354311531880-190</Id><Title>There is no point in pretending that Obama is a decent, honest human being. 1/2 of the nation knows that he's not.</Title><Msg>You can't compromise with a criminal..</Msg><Username>bilious_barack</Username><Timestamp>1354311531880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 16:38:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354311598827-191</Id><Title>Compromising with Obama = compromising with Hitler.</Title><Msg>Period............................................</Msg><Username>bilious_barack</Username><Timestamp>1354311598827</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 16:39:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354311733828-192</Id><Title>Not one Democrat in the country is worth one's trust.

As soon as they realize that they are destroying it. It's actually hard to explain. You have to look up what FDR said about public service unions. When Unions take over public service, the country suffers. When they work for private industry, the country thrives. Maybe one of the private unions will defect from the Democrat party? States cannot declare bankrupcy. Corporations don't want to. If a Corporation goes bankrupt, the union loses their job. If a State goes broke, the same thing will probably happen and the Feds will probably have to bail them out. It will probably get worse before it gets better. Democracies fade to Dictatorships after the treasury is looted. No true democracy has ever existed for more than 200 years. We are a Republic, or "representative democracy." We were supposed to be able to vote for an intelligent representative. Instead we failed and got a "lesser of two evils" scenario. One of two evils won.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354315189837</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 17:39:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354315368223-221</Id><Topic><Title>Dumb Dumb on the STUPID sauce again</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1354314639981</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 17:30:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are brothers, their parents were brother and sister.
