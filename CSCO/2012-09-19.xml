How much will it gap down in the morning. By all means no matter what news happens Cisco will indeed close the week at best only slightly down. Today, Wednesday, is a new product announcement which will likely encourage further those who are shorting Cisco to make it gap even further down but by how much, 4% gap down in the morning? 5%? more?

Even Peggy Noonan is declaring Mitt incompetent, LOL I think there is a broad and growing feeling now, among Republicans, that this thing is slipping out of Romney’s hands. Today at a speech in New York with what seemed like many conservatives and Republicans in the audience, I said more or less the above. I wondered if anyone would say, in the Q&amp;A, “I think you’ve got it wrong, you’re too pessimistic.” No one did. A woman asked me to talk about why in a year the Republicans couldn’t lose, the Republican candidate seems to be losing. I said pre-mortems won’t help, if you want to help the more conservative candidate, it’s a better use of your time to pitch in with ideas. There’s seven weeks to go. This isn’t over, it’s possible to make things better. Republicans are going to have to right this thing. They have to stabilize it. It’s time to admit the Romney campaign is an incompetent one. It’s not big, it’s not brave, it’s not thoughtfully tackling great issues. It’s always been too small for the moment. All the activists, party supporters and big donors should be pushing for change. People want to focus on who at the top is least constructive and most responsible. Fine, but Mitt Romney is no puppet: He chooses who to listen to. An intervention is in order. “Mitt, this isn’t working.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348064473691</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:21:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348066958993-12</Id><Title>Only way oil price can drop is recession</Title><Msg>Recession is only cure for commodity inflation.

In the twilight of President Barack Obama's first term, many polls, including a new Quinnipiac University tri-state survey of likely voters, show that most Americans say they are not better off than they were four years ago. But in those same polls, the president retains his edge over challenger Mitt Romney. That's not normal, says Quinnipiac University pollster Peter A. Brown. According to a poll released on Wednesday by Quinnipiac University, CBS News and the New York Times, Romney still has not overtaken Obama among the likely voters in the battleground states of Colorado, Virginia and Wisconsin. While Virginians are split on whether they're better off than they were four years ago, voters in the other states say they're worse off. What gives? Two words: "Likability" and "relatability"—areas, according to the data, in which Romney continues to struggle. In those three states, Romney's favorability rating among likely voters hovers around 45 percent. Obama's numbers are slightly better, with favorability ratings of 49 percent in Colorado, 53 percent in Virginia and 52 percent in Wisconsin. (Meanwhile, former President Bill Clinton's favorability rating in all three states remains above 60 percent, which may explain why Obama has been running ads online showing him with Clinton and not Vice President Joe Biden, who's favorability tops out at 42 percent in those states, according to the poll.) Perhaps even more telling is the poll's question about whether likely voters think Obama or Romney care more "about the needs and problems of people like you." In all three states, Obama leads by at least 10 percentage points. In Wisconsin, he has a 17 percentage-point edge on that question over Romney. "Most times if voters think things haven't gone well, they say, 'Let's think of somebody else.' But at this point they're not saying that," Brown said. "Clearly they think [Obama] is more in tune with their lives." The poll does show, however, that Obama has lost ground in two of the three states' polls. His five percentage-point lead in Colorado last month has evaporated to a dead heat with Romney and his lead in Wisconsin has trimmed from 51-45 percent to 49-47 percent. "Obviously, if you're Mr. Obama, you're happier than if you're in Mr. Romney's shoes," Brown said of the poll. But he added a word of caution: The numbers "are not overwhelming."</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo6</Username><Timestamp>1348073513565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:51:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348074194965-25</Id><Topic><Title>WILLARD IS A USED CAR SALESMAN, HE'll SAY ANYTHING TO GET YOU TO BUY A LEMON</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1348072163916</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:29:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>President Willard , oh hell no ,don't even jingle this one !</Msg><Username>settegast_scholar</Username><Timestamp>1348074194965</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 13:03:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348074321278-26</Id><Title>THE FED IS INSOLVENT</Title><Msg>4 TRILLION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO TAX PAYERS AND THE BANKERS DID LIKE BANDITS AGAIN.

It means they GET money from the IRS rather than pay. 3) There is a child credit tax relief thingy too. Many lower income families with children are eligible for this. 4) Most people still pay FICA &amp; similar taxes which are fixed %s of income, like a flat tax, up to some maximum income. 5) Depending on your state, some people still pay state income taxes and local city/county income taxes. (Not all states, cities or counties have income taxes.) But this is a write off against federal income taxes (if you itemize.) The result is that around 47% of Americans are not required to pay federal INCOME taxes because that is how our tax system works. (They still pay FICA and similar.) This is how the current rules work. Get over it! This is really no more "awful" than that Mitt Romney pays (was it?) 13% federal income tax rate (and around $3 million.) But he has lots of different income streams, subject to different tax rules, and lots of deductions and credits for each stream. AND he pays out about 16% of his income in charity, which REDUCES his federal taxes and tax rate. This is also how our current rules work. Get over it. Some people think we should change it and simplify it with a much simpler system. Like a "Flat Rate" tax or "Fair Tax." I agree. Libs complain that "Flat Rate" taxes are "Regressive" rather than "Progressive." Also that "Fair Taxes" are "Unfair!" But then that is Lib thinking.</Msg><Username>travisthechimp.obama</Username><Timestamp>1348108495153</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 22:34:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348108555303-92</Id><Topic><Title>Everyone in the Army</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348108420332</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 22:33:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ is the matter with our army?
