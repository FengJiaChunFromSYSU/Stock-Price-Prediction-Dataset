Piers, if your Queens family had their way we would be eating crumpets and have no bill of rights. What if we went to UK and told you to get rid of the Royals? This is what the petition on the White House petition website says WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO: Deport British Citizen Piers Morgan for Attacking 2nd Amendment British Citizen and CNN television host Piers Morgan is engaged in a hostile attack against the U.S. Constitution by targeting the Second Amendment. We demand that Mr. Morgan be deported immediately for his effort to undermine the Bill of Rights and for exploiting his position as a national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of American citizens Go to that website and sign this petition. Its not a freedom of speech issue, its our rights and Gen. Washington fought Piers forefathers for the right to give us our rights and freedom. We dishonor our forefathers if we let this Brit tell us we don't deserve our constitution.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1356469192148</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 15:59:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356469529480-18</Id><Title>WOW DEM BLUE STATE DEVILS DIDN'T SHOOT ANYONE TODAY?</Title><Msg>#$%$?
