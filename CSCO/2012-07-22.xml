Bloomberg: Bank of America, which self-reported the illegal activity, has been cooperating for more than four years with Justice Department prosecutors who say that bankers paid kickbacks to CDR Financial Products to rig bids on investment contracts sold to local governments. Municipalities bought the contracts with money raised through bond sales, which allowed them to earn a return until the funds were needed for schools, roads, and other public works. Hopefully, this is just the beginning.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1342971186311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 11:33:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342971832183-4</Id><Title>It's all about the "other America" isn't it?</Title><Msg>If there was any lingering doubt about whether Mitt Romney intended to run a campaign that resorted to all the usual right-wing racial dog whistles -- almost fully settled, really, by the way he handled his NAACP speech and afterward, nattering on about how you black people Obama voters just want "free stuff" -- then his most recent attack should lay any doubts to rest. It's kind of peculiar, because it actually shows the president to some advantage: Not only can he sing pretty well, but the song he's singing is an old-fashioned soul homage to monogamy, Al Green's "Let's Stay Together." (Full disclosure: "Let's Stay Together" is "our song" for my wife and I, performed on demand by the band at our wedding in 1989. It worked!) But that's not how the Romney people see it. Gary Silverman at Financial Times thought it was all very peculiar too, so he sniffed around a little to find out what they were thinking: One of the better answers I have found comes from a well-known supporter of Mr Romney – Suzy Welch, former editor in chief of the Harvard Business Review, and wife of Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric. In an appearance on CNN with her husband, Mrs Welch suggested that Mr Obama’s personal style and choice of musical material define him as a member of a “different America”. I would imagine this is why Mr Romney’s campaign included the snippet of Mr Obama singing “Let’s Stay Together” at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. They hoped it would convey his otherness. “It’s the difference between the songs that they’re singing,” Mrs Welch said. “Mitt Romney didn’t exactly do a beautiful job on that song, but think about what he’s singing, OK? I mean it’s that patriotic song and he goes all the way through it. Then you’ve got the very cool Barack Obama singing Al Green. That is the two different Americas. Isn’t it?” Yeah, evidently, there are two Americas: Cloistered white people who are so fearful of all things nonwhite that they find something ominous and threatening and Other-ly in an old R&amp;B song. And the rest of us. As Paul Krugman suggests, who'd have ever thought Al Green would be viewed as a threat to the American way of life?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1342971832183</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 11:43:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342978041673-5</Id><Topic><Title>Barry's photo op</Title><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1342923495451</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 22:18:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hear Obama has a black baby, just like McCain.

This undated photo provided by the Romney campaign shows Ann Romney with Rafalca, a mare she co-owns. Rafalca won a spot on the Olympic dressage team, along with trainer Jan Ebeling. Rafalca, the 15-year-old Oldenburg mare co-owned by Mrs. Romney, won a spot on the Olympic dressage team, along with trainer Jan Ebeling. The U.S. Equestrian Federation made the official announcement naming the Olympic competitors over the weekend. While Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney continued a swing-state bus tour this weekend, his wife was in Gladstone, N.J., on Saturday to cheer on Rafalca. “It’s great to be part of the Olympics again,” Mrs. Romney said on Twitter. “We are so proud of Jan and Team USA. Now let’s bring home the gold!” Mrs. Romney’s involvement in dressage has trained a spotlight on the little-known sport. Horses and riders are scored on a sequence of precise movements in a competition that has been likened to “horse ballet.” Mrs. Romney has credited dressage with relieving many of the symptoms she suffered after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. While the Romneys have introduced dressage to a new audience, this endeavor also has become a punchline in recent weeks. Comedian Stephen Colbert declared dressage the official sport of summer, saying, “This is exactly what Mitt needs. He’s had a little trouble relating to Joe Sixpack.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343000731101</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 19:45:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343003009811-27</Id><Title>WOW, HOW MUCH BETTER WAS BUSH THAN OBIMBO!!!

Every other observation falters when this one reality is ignored. Humans are created for community. Genuine, caring, involved, community. That is our deepest longing. Yes, that guy was weird, but at the root of failure, at the base of the damage done to the fabric of Aurora, is the failure of anyone in his 'community' to genuinely, and caringly, engage that goober. Sure he was weird, and perhaps, beyond help, or hope, but at least in the effort to engage him, that might have been seen, and someone actually walk into his apartment, someone realize how weird he was and contact someone with the keys. Sad, and painful. Not a Democratic failure, not a Republican failure, not a Tea Party failure, not a gun control failure.... but the failure of community.
