Alas, it's really not working out that way, is it... The problem is that instead of forthcoming, good-faith disclosure -and perhaps some smidgen of accountability- the habitually-dishonest Obama Administration has been lying about Benghazi from the start: the cause, the circumstances on the ground, the perpetrators, what they knew and when they knew it, who's to blame for dismissal of security concerns at our consulate, Obama's initial reaction to the attack, etc. Dear Leader has also run the bus right over Hillary, Petraeus, and two top commanders in a shameful attempt to deflect blame for his own total and complete FAIL at Benghazi on 9/11/12, while orchestrating a cover-up so massive it makes Watergate look like some college prank. It all started with a cockamamie story re. Benghazi having something to do with a YouTube video and a protest that never happened. UN Ambassador Susan Rice was pushed out on the stage to promote this for four days straight, yet Gen. Petraeus recently made it clear the CIA knew it was AQ right away... and that they never bought into the 'protest' bit. Now that Obama himself, his Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the State Dept have all distanced themselves from the 'video' fairy-tale as well -adding they 'don't know' who edited-out mention of Al Qaeda from the Benghazi talking-points- you have to wonder why Susan Rice was out hard-selling us a fictional, fatherless version of events nobody seems to have ever believed for a minute. Subsequent spray-painting of the turd has proved largely ineffectual. and now that Obama is attempting elevate that same toady Susan Rice to Secretary of State, her previous willingness to stand up and lie for this vile administration has brought the wrath of GOP lawmakers- it's about damn time they got #$%$ about something. An increasingly cornered Obama has slipped-into his standard default setting of 'only the Republicans care about this', but that's not fooling most thinking people anymore- including some on the other side of the pond: Daily Telegraph (UK): President Obama hasn’t even begun his second term yet, but his administration is already struggling with a huge credibility problem on the Benghazi front... Jay Carney told the assembled White House press corps: "...the president ... is not particularly concerned about whether the ambassador or I went out and talked about the fact that we believed extremists might have been responsible. And whether we named them as al Qaeda or not does not–no, it certainly doesn't have any bearing on what happened and who was responsible as that investigation was continuing on Benghazi." Carney’s response, as the president’s official spokesman is extraordinarily dismissive of the concerns of the American people as well as the United States Congress, and is representative of the administration’s shambolic handling of the Benghazi attack. Susan Rice is the US Ambassador to the United Nations and Obama’s likely choice to replace Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State. What she misleadingly told millions of Americans on national television regarding the circumstances surrounding the first assassination of a US Ambassador since 1979 is of great public interest, and the nation deserves clear answers about what exactly the president and his top advisers knew before, during and after the Benghazi atrocity, and how they responded... Already there's political observers thinking that an arrogant, damn-the-torpedoes nomination of Susan Rice for Secretary of State could be Barack Obama's political undoing... and this one's a Democrat. Plenty of questions left to answer about Benghazi and the (ongoing) Obama Administration cover-up, too- oh yeah.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1354187043052</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 06:04:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354187543927-8</Id><Topic><Title>Where is the special dividend by year end???</Title><Username>yourdaddy3980</Username><Timestamp>1354179096344</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 03:51:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you voted for Obama you prevented John Chambers from repatriating tens of billions of dollars.

Bush took over in 2001 there were budget surpluses that were projected to last till 2019</Title><Msg>When Bill Clinton left office and George W. Bush took over in 2001 there were budget surpluses that were projected to last till 2019, seven years from now! Clinton had cut domestic spending and increased military spending and had a booming economy to go along with his 2003 tax increase. There was no “excessive government spending” unless you want to count our bloated military budget. George W. Bush changed all of that by cutting taxes, mostly for the benefit of the top 5% of Americans and their companies, starting two costly wars, and running around the country raising campaign cash while the economy was manipulated and brought to its knees by the super wealthy to their limited advantage! Now here we are, but this is what the Neo-Conservatives have wanted all along – budget deficits large enough to force Congress, including Red State Congressmen who depend on federal spending programs, to cut domestic spending. Grover Norquist said in late 2000, after Bush was selected as President, that he wanted to shrink the federal government to the point it would fit into a bath tub, and then drown it! “Mission Accomplished,” even though it is not small enough to fit into a bath tub, it is drowning in red ink! However, the budget deficits during WW2, as a percentage of GDP, were over twice as high as current deficits and we did not collapse, even with a 91% top marginal income tax bracket on ALL income over $200,000 for individuals. We became the manufacturing champions of the world and we ran trade surpluses and became the world’s chief lender! Now, thanks to ‘free trade’, we run huge trade deficits which contribute to the budget deficits, and makes us a debtor nation instead of a lender. Bush and the rest of the Neo-Cons did not count on collapsing the economy in the process. The best way to get the deficit reduced is to put millions of Americans back to work in good paying jobs so that they are once again paying federal and state income taxes, and are buying things, but this won’t happen as long as the “job creators” (who most benefitted from Bush’s tax cuts) are still using ‘free trade’ to eliminate American jobs and the wages, health insurance premiums, retirement benefits, and Social Security matching they are required to pay in favor of Asian slave labor! Plus, we must raise the top tax brackets at least back to the 50% rate that existed at the end of Reagan’s first term! Apply that rate to all income over $10 million to compensate for inflation since WW2. Until Reagan, and then Bush Jr., cut the tax rates for the wealthiest Americans, business owners put company profits back into their companies or paid dividends to common stock holders to avoid paying high personal income taxes. With Bush’s tax cuts that is no longer a problem, so owners and CEOs now pay themselves a king’s ransom no matter how poorly their company is doing, because they pay no tax penalty for their extreme greed! We should cut corporate taxes to zero, since they lie, cheat, and steal to avoid their taxes anyway, and bring back the 70% top personal income tax bracket that existed when Reagan took office in 1981. Apply that bracket to all income over $100 million annual income and with no distinction between earned income from wages, and unearned income from capital gains, dividends, and rents! If the most greedy want to avoid paying taxes they could pay themselves less, pay their common stock holders and workers more. The rich would pay less income tax, the workers would pay more income taxes, and everyone plus our country would be better off! The penalty for tax evasion should then be prison or permanent deportation to wherever your money is stashed overseas!</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1354194592716</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 08:09:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354195512303-13</Id><Topic><Title>When Bill Clinton left office and George W.

By the way, anyone with a brain knows you can NEVER use the 90's as a guide to normalcy, that time was one of the biggest technological booms in our time with the internet. That had NOTHING to do with tax policy or domestic policy. More millionairs and billionaires were made in that time because of the internet and THAT IS WHY so much revenue came into the government.

Claims missed expectations and prior data was revised higher leaving the four-week-average at its highest since October 2011 jumping back over 400k. More critically, when we dig into the details on the DoL site, we find some rather disturbing trends that totally dismiss Sandy effects. For instance, according to the DoL, there were 30.6k fewer initial claims in New York Last week - when this higher aggregate data point is supposed to be due to 'Sandy'. FL, MI, and MA saw the largest increases in claims. It seems blaming this trend-break on Sandy is now a non-starter - fiscal cliff front-running perhaps?

Take his legislative agenda. No Child Left Behind is now widely unpopular among both liberals and conservatives—so unpopular that Congress has spent the past five years assiduously avoiding a vote to reauthorize it. His tax cuts expired in 2010 and are now little more than a political football. His own party wants to repeal key provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley. The Supreme Court has effectively gutted campaign finance reform. On the foreign policy front, his wars are widely viewed as expensive failures. And he was never able to get so much as a vote on Social Security privatization or immigration reform. That doesn't leave much. Pretty much all that's left is the PATRIOT Act and the Medicare prescription drug bill. That's not much for eight years. Beyond that, neither party wants anything to do with him. It's not surprising that Democrats still think of him as the Frat Boy President, one of the worst of all time, but what is surprising is that Republicans largely agree. But there's a bonus for the taxpayers children and grandchildren, he lwft them with a $3Trillion bill for his two precious wars and they are still counting, imagine paying all health bennies for 60-80 years for all these vets.

Obama has outlined his proposal to raise the individual rates on the top 2% of Americans in order to raise $1 trillion in revenue over the next decade. Democrats counter that the onus is on Republicans to put forward a plan outlining spending cuts. "You can't start if (Republicans) aren't putting anything on the table.

The tax cuts are one issue. The debt ceiling is another. Republicans can approve the tax hike without giving a dime on the automatic spending cuts. Obama will have to figure out what to cut, or it is automatic. You can spend what your tax hike takes in, and a raise in capital gains won't affect the balance until estimated taxes are paid.

You don't like Walmart, don't shop there. Isn't that your own position on so many other things? You don't want to drink whiskey, fine, don't drink it, but don't deny it to everyone else. You smoke marijuana heavily, but you don't insist that everyone else smokes, eh? You drive an electric car, but hey!, not everyone HAS to drive an electric car...all good. Costco pays their people more money, good for Costco. If they take business away from Walmart, then likely Walmart will emulate their model and fight back. It's America....we love that about America! Why are you upset at Walmart? Are you the same guy that's all upset about the Papa John pizza guy's big house? Liberals are so much like that.....who cares how big the well to do pizza guy's house is. If that makes you mad, don't buy Papa Johns. I like that pizza and I eat that, not Pizza Hut!

Nothing wrong with that tactic, but you'd be a fool to think he needed to fly the family, press, staff and all out to Texas 77 times on our dime to "work." There's only so much brush that needs cutting. Out of respect for the man- I voted for him- I won't go into that whole August-before-9/11 thing either. Bottom line: Presidents travel. GET OVER IT. You want a President who flies coach, move to Kazakhstan.</Msg><Username>belongsinamuseum</Username><Timestamp>1354240701595</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 20:58:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354241106154-234</Id><Topic><Title>WHY IS OBAMA PUSHING AMERICANS OFF THE FISCAL CLIFF?</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1354216456578</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:14:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not Junior.

Bush responded to a bunch of flakes who flew planes into US buildings THUS declaring war. Bush had our army do their job and some die, regrettably so, but that is there "job". They know it. The four State Deprtment/CIA people were ATTACKED and it wasn't their job to fight anyone. They were victims. I beleive Bush gave Iraq the option to "surrender" but their crazied leader didn't want to. OBAMA, unlike Bush, just stood around and did NOTHING!!!!! to protect Americans. I'll take a person willing to defend Americans to one who doesn't give a whit about anyone but himself.</Msg><Username>casmiata</Username><Timestamp>1354242122211</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 21:22:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354242563366-236</Id><Topic><Title>Deomocrats are in charge so just sitting back,</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1354239721211</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 20:42:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He would still not get any blame if things go badly.

They are already talking about a three state solution involving Israel, Gaza, and West Bank. Apparently, If Israel wasn't between the West Bank and Gaza, Hamas would be fighting against Fatah. Should be interesting to see the fistfight when both Hamas and Fatah send people to sit as observers.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1354242864669</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 21:34:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354248144475-238</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats latest fiscal cliff plan</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1354230550737</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 18:09:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The kommies want to raise the fed gas tax and steal IRA's/ 401k's.
