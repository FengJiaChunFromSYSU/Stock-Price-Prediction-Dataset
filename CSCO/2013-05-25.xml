Justice Scalia quit his post in a terse resignation letter that read, in part: “Some of the happiest memories of my adult life have been as a scoutmaster. Huddling under blankets around the campfire, and so forth. But now, all of that has been ruined. Ruined.” Shortly after sending the letter, Justice Scalia destroyed his scoutmaster uniform in the blazing fireplace of his Supreme Court office. Later, he went across the hall to share his decision with his close confidant on the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas, telling him, “There’s nowhere I feel safe anymore, Clarence. The military? The N.B.A.? Nowhere. I guess the only place I still feel safe is the Supreme Court. This is still a safe place, isn’t it?” Justice Thomas said nothing in reply.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1369490950470</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 10:09:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369492341686-34</Id><Topic><Title>deapainting" 'OBAMA USED HIS TORNADO MACHINE' on republicans</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_7</Username><Timestamp>1369487729973</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 09:15:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He is the Drone Ranger, bombing everything</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1369492341686</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 10:32:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369492426426-35</Id><Title>"I'm not a big fan of contraception" Reaching out to women program.</Title><Msg>VA GOP Treasurer: 'I'm Not A Big Fan Of Contraception' Posted: 24 May 2013 03:00 PM PDT You have to see this. Bob Fitzsimmonds is the treasurer of the Republican Party of Virginia who served as Ken Cuccinelli's legislative aide in the Senate, and is a close adviser to the man who very well may be Virginia's next governor: 1. Starting at 7:45, Fitzsimmonds starts ranting about sex education and "the spread of STDs." He claims that "HIV's kind of hard to catch, abortion happens if you get pregnant, but we're on the trajectory for 50% of the American people to have herpes... and that is a profound not only health but sociological crisis that's facing this country, and it's not even as prevalent as HPV." Fitzsimmonds adds, "we have a disease [HPV] out there that's killing women more than HIV is, and we don't even talk about it." Hmmm...actually we do talk about vaccinating young people against HPV (see this video of Del. Patrick Hope, for instance) but isn't Cuccinelli against that? 2. Starting at 9:10, Fitzsimmonds claims, "We have an entire generation of children who are in their teens, 50% of the ones that are sexually active have an STD...we never lived with this kind of crisis; so I think we absolutely have to address that, and I think Ken will do it." Alrighty then. 3. Starting at 11:50, he talks about his 501c(3) waiting for approval from the IRS; "it doesn't say 'Tea Party" in the name, but it does say 'Christian abstinence.'" Yep, that's apparently Fitzsimmond's big thing: "Christian abstinence." Is that what the people of Virginia want in their governor? I guess we're going to find out. 4. Starting at 13:30 he says, "I'm not a big fan of contraception, frankly...I think there are some issues with giving morning-after pills to 12 year olds, and pretty soon I guess we'll hand them out to babies, I don't know." Giving out morning-after pills to babies - hahahahaha, very funny. That WAS meant as a "joke," right? Wow.

He CAN though, be tried as a spy, because that's exactly what he is. And you're right, the military know's what to do with spies and traitors. The military HATES the Mvslim PieceOS because NO MILITARY MAN gave the order to STAND DOWN because those 4 Americans that the Kenyan killed, WERE THEM! That order came directly from the top because NO ONE ELSE has the authority to give that order. NO ONE. And pox on the military cowards and their families that obeyed the Kenyan's stand down order, they are garbage. No one WOULD give that order unless of course they had something to gain and we all know who stood to make A HUGE gain,… his middle name, is,…….. That was an "act of war" against the United States and there's no way on God's green earth that the Mvslim monkey didn't know about it E-f; u.c/kingmediately and all he did was watch them die from the situation room before jetting off to Vegas to campaign and party with their blood still fresh on his hands. It wasn't negligence, it wasn't ineptitude, it wasn't a mistake, it WAS quite intentional what the Kenyan did, he murdered them for his own arrogant elitist political reasons because Americans are skumm to the Mvslim PieceOS, but not his commmie coolies. Not that he wouldn't sacrifice one or two of them for political reasons and the simple minded glassy eyed socio-sheep would be honored to die for their evil Mvslim Messiah just like their counterparts did for the Chairman,… just listen to how they worship him and glorify him as their demigod Mvslim Messiah on all the message boards.</Msg><Username>ivanhoeofloxxly</Username><Timestamp>1369528817660</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 20:40:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369530190163-104</Id><Topic><Title>LOIS LERNER SHOULD BE SENT TO PRISON, BE FIRED, FORFEIT RETIREMENT BENEFITS, FORFEIT BONUSES</Title><Username>raymooondo</Username><Timestamp>1369513449249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 16:24:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The same goes double for the Mvslim monkey spy in the White House who gave her the order to spy on and target American Patriots in order to disrupt and ruin their lives and suppress their votes.
