Rand Paul (R-Kentucky). “The only way President Obama can remove that cloud is by resigning from office at once.” While many in the media have blamed Beyoncé for the lip-synching controversy, Mr. Paul said, “We must remember that this happened on President Obama’s watch.” Mr. Paul said that the White House’s refusal to comment on the Beyoncé crisis “only serves the argument that this President has something to hide.” “If Beyoncé lip-synched the national anthem, how do we know President Obama didn’t lip-sync his oath of office?” he said. “If that’s the case, he’s not legally President. But just to be on the safe side, he should resign anyway.” Mr. Paul also blasted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her testimony on Benghazi before the Senate today: “Her tactic of answering each and every question we asked her didn’t fool anyone.” .</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359025964651</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 06:12:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359029059955-3</Id><Topic><Title>csco</Title><Username>mmrc_99</Username><Timestamp>1358992817804</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 21:00:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually JP Morgan has been at neutral from $16 to $21 and then they downgraded to underperform.

Oh but I do IDIOT,the Taliban is all bent outa shape right now over comments Prince Harry made about his tour in Afghanistan,a war started by George W Bush by the way.Republicans are all bent outa shape over Beyonce lip-syncing the National anthem at Obama's inauguration.Sounds quite similar to me. Excerpt from rightwing rag The NewYork Post: Lip service: Beyonce faked anthem at Obama inauguration O say can’t she sing? Beyoncé’s dazzling rendition of the National Anthem at President Obama’s inauguration was a total fake — with the megastar lip-syncing as the Marine Corps Band merely pretended to play its instruments, sources said yesterday. The Grammy-award winner’s decision to use a taped version of “The Star-Spangled Banner” stunned the first family, which handpicked her for the occasion. “Oh, my God! You’re best friends with Michelle and you faked it! I am very upset,” said a source close to the Obamas. “I would like my three minutes back.” Beyoncé’s performance was a well-choreographed acting job. She made it appear as if she was belting out the anthem as a crowd of dignitaries and a million other attendees watched in awe from the National Mall. A worldwide television audience was also clueless to the chicanery. As she mouthed the words, Col. Michael J. Colburn emphatically led the United States Marine Band, whose members acted as if they were blowing on wind instruments and horns and banging on drums throughout the song.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359039817966</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:03:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359040541948-24</Id><Title>Looks like that chunk of shares I bought at $20.67</Title><Msg>are looking pretty good right now.

The announcement by the country's top military body came a day after the U.N. Security Council agreed to a U.S.-backed resolution to censure and sanction North Korea for a rocket launch in December that breached U.N. rules. North Korea is not believed to have the technology to deliver a nuclear warhead capable of hitting the continental United States, although its December launch showed it had the capacity to deliver a rocket that could travel 10,000 km (6,200 miles), potentially putting San Francisco in range, according to an intelligence assessment by South Korea. remember this liberals when this hits your town, and how obama was looking out for your "children" .</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1359041013327</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:23:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359041014448-29</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like that chunk of shares I bought at $20.67</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359040541948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 10:15:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>are looking pretty good right now.

Take his legislative agenda. No Child Left Behind is now widely unpopular among both liberals and conservatives—so unpopular that Congress has spent the past five years assiduously avoiding a vote to reauthorize it. His tax cuts expired in 2010 and are now little more than a political football. His own party wants to repeal key provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley. The Supreme Court has effectively gutted campaign finance reform. On the foreign policy front, his wars are widely viewed as expensive failures. And he was never able to get so much as a vote on Social Security privatization or immigration reform. That doesn't leave much. Pretty much all that's left is the PATRIOT Act and the Medicare prescription drug bill. That's not much for eight years. Beyond that, neither party wants anything to do with him. It's not surprising that Democrats still think of him as the Frat Boy President, one of the worst of all time, but what is surprising is that Republicans largely agree. Historians will discuss his legacy and dutifully pee on his grave as they celebrate his demise.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359052304327</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 13:31:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359052370829-70</Id><Title>58k American skilled there</Title><Msg>they weren't that skilled after they were killed, LOL gaggers are a laugh a minute.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359052370829</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 13:32:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359053295849-71</Id><Topic><Title>JOHN KERRY SEC.

Yes, I know, John McCain was shot down, captured, held as a prisoner of war and tortured. For that he's been held out as a hero and he's made a career out of it. Heroic? Maybe so. But at some point, someone has to say that it takes more than just that to be a true "hero," and how you live your life back home also defines you. For so long John McCain has been treated as if anything he's done since returning from Vietnam somehow doesn't count. Things like this: Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joked that he’s going to get the truth out of Sen. John Kerry during confirmation hearings this week, even if he has to resort to enhanced interrogation methods. Kerry has been nominated to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state. “We will look forward to interrogating him at his hearing next week, mercilessly,” McCain joked at a press conference on Tuesday afternoon. “We will bring back for the only time waterboarding to get the truth out of him.” The list of really stupid things that McCain has said and done over the years is indeed a long one, and too many times the traditional media and pundits let him of the hook because he's "hero." He was tortured after all! Some say his idea of a "joke" (recall "Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb Iran....but seriously folks...") has turned him into one. I disagree. He's not a joke. He's pathetic and a coward who hides behind something he once was. His "record" as a Senator proves it. To "joke" as he does is to mock anyone who was tortured. To do so is to mock anyone who has served, along with my father and my husband who both did, the latter in Vietnam. John McCain, of all people knows this. But he does it anyway. Because he's a "hero." Wrong. He's anything but. He ceased to be a long time ago. He selected Simple Sarah, doesn't that count for anything?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359056645892</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 14:44:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359056871004-78</Id><Title>Lucy you got some splaining to do</Title><Msg>Blue Horseshoe loves HZO</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359056871004</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 14:47:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359056934846-79</Id><Title>Hillary Clinton 2016!!!!</Title><Msg>First, I have always liked Hillary, her policies, intellect and toughness.

Second, Barack Obama is successfully helping America out of the corrosive, debillitating Reagan era trickle down BS. Third, with a clear pathway to the white house, Hillary will knock down barriers better than anyone else, by a huge margin. The worst offenders in the American debt problem is the COST per person of health care in the US, AND the absurd expenditure on defense, military bases, and being the world's policeman. ABSURD! Hillary will appoint 2 supreme court judges that will obliterate the Citizen's United government for sale decision. Hillary will help to amend the Affordable Care Act to institute a PUBLIC OPTION that will move us closer to Canadian style healthcare DRAMATICALLY reducing US healthcare expenditure and debt. She will get rid of Medicare part D which is a ridiculous giveaway to pharmaceutical companies. She will MAKE Israel cooperate with people, who are not citizens of Israel yet living under Israeli rule, in Paslestine.

It is not American exceptionalism to ask young people to die in war while asking the most wealthy to bathe in the luxury of tax cuts. It is not American exceptionalism to insult women with talk of legitimate rape, to insult capitalism with excuses for women being paid less than men, or to quote the church in support of cutting programs that help the poor, as the Republican nominee for vice president did before being reprimanded by many who wear the cloth. It is an anomaly of our times that the red meat of extremism thrown to the mob wins so many cheers from the relative few, while being so powerfully rejected by the many, who understand American exceptionalism far better than they do. There are reasons that the champions of this pseudo-American exceptionalism, which warps and distorts the notions of Americanism in the service of greed and extremism and self-interest and fear that our Founders would hold in contempt, keep losing elections. The crybabies of the right, who were so triumphalist in the closing days of the last campaign when they convinced each other that their champion Romney would win, when they chortled with glee about Romney's demeaning of half the nation in his absurd and infamous speech, when they stood tall with some who call rape legitimate, when they misquoted faith in favor of hurting the blessed poor, now, in the valley of their political demise, whine that their opponents want to annihilate them, when in truth they annihilated themselves in the eyes of those who choose our leaders.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359058979415</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:22:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359059111066-86</Id><Title>New gun legislation just political posing...</Title><Msg>... will make NO difference in number of future gun violence incidence.
