Shure ya do....</Title><Msg>Gordon Klingenschmitt This week’s “winner” is Gordon Klingenschmitt, a newly-minted candidate for Colorado’s state legislature whom Right Wing Watch helpfully describes as a “disgraced former Navy Chaplain who brags of having successfully performed an exorcism on a lesbian soldier and who has stated again and again that demonic spirits are behind everything from abortion to gay marriage to ENDA to President Obama to Madonna.” In an email to his supporters, which Right Wing Watch flagged on Thursday, Klingenschmitt explained his opposition to the Employment Nondiscrimination Act. It is, to put it lightly, completely insane. So-called [homosexual] civil “rights” commissions are replacing courts across America, stacked with Democrat appointees, and given unlimited power to punish, intimidate, and threaten Christian business owners. Not on my watch. Not in this America. Let’s end it now. The militant gays essentially demand “let us have sex in your house, or we will kick you out of your house.” Do Christians no longer have control of their own home or business? This is coming to the USA if we allow ENDA to become law. I’ve been warning for two years that ENDA would bankrupt Christian businesses. Now the Oregon government is helping this anti-Christian intimidation. Just imagine if Democrats pass ENDA nationwide, to “investigate” all Christians who refuse to participate in gay ‘weddings? Perhaps sensing your urge to laugh in his face, Klingenschmitt insists that militant gays kicking you out of your house so they can have sex in it is a serious matter. “They’re coming for us, people. This is no joke. This will happen to YOU if we allow ENDA to become law,” he writes. Meanwhile, Klingenschmitt is probably starting to look awfully appealing to a certain subsection of the Colorado electorate.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382879405380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 09:10:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382879461879-10</Id><Topic><Title>Remember this guy?

The former pizza magnate, whose underdog presidential bid imploded in epic fashion amid allegations of sexual harassment and carrying on a 13-year affair, has a new explanation for the failure of his campaign. If you guessed startling incompetence, an economic plan stolen from Sim City, or general creepiness, you’re wrong. As Glenn Beck could have told you, Satan is actually to blame. During an interview with RealClearReligion which was published Wednesday, Cain insisted that the women who accused him of harassment are “liars,” and blamed the media for not scrutinizing their allegations. Then things got weird: Then he speculated as to who may have orchestrated the allegations: the Devil. “It made me realize that there was a force bigger than right,” Cain said. It may sound like Cain is paranoid or making excuses, but maybe he does know of what he speaks. After all, as Michele Bachmann reminded us during the 2012 campaign, “When you take the 9-9-9 plan, and turn it upside down, the devil’s in the details.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382879461879</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 09:11:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382879692047-11</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary and Kerry have degraded America's credibility around the world!</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1382818711538</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-26 16:18:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No other way to spin it, pecker-woods!

The burning cross photo came from The Black Sphere, a site run by a conservative African-American writer named Kevin Jackson, who originally published the picture as a response to comments Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL) made comparing the Tea Party to the KKK. TPM reached out to Wurzelbacher to ask about the tweet and he emailed us statements from both himself and Jackson. “I know the media doesn’t want to talk about it, but racism is/was/always will be part of the Democrat party. I have heard more racist thing out of liberal progressives then I have out of conservatives. I’m tired of the media giving them a pass,” Wurzelbacher wrote. “Myself and a few other conservatives will not allow the left to continue setting the narrative. Racism is wrong on so many levels and when political parties use it as a weapon they aren’t fighting racism they are encouraging it.” …Wurzelbacher and Jackson made headlines earlier this month after Wurzelbacher published an essay written by Jackson on his website. That essay was entitled “America Needs a White Republican President.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382881494007</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 09:44:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382881497772-23</Id><Topic><Title>Incompetent King Should Resign</Title><Username>thehiringsquad12</Username><Timestamp>1382880835210</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 09:33:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really stupid post,Junior.

Those that haven’t been insured now get free market insurance. And finally to do so without raising taxes or having the government take over health care. So what I did has begun a bit of a national revolution relating to health care. Indeed it was a national revolution, Democrats like Van Jones say, as Romney's plan in Massachusetts - which included the individual mandate - served as the blueprint for Obamacare. We have seen the progress of this idea play out on this very site. Fast forward to 2010. Speaking to Big Think on the subject of health care, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said this: We would accept the libertarian argument that if you don’t want to buy health insurance, you could be allowed to post a bond or in some other way to be financially responsible...</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382883101765</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 10:11:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382887159691-28</Id><Title>why the cisco board</Title><Msg>Why has the cisco board been chosen to spew political hatred and garbage talk and not talk about the stock.

The Delta - Democrat - Times reports that Lawrence E. Shine Thornton of Greenville, Miss., died two days after the October 18th mugging, allegedly at the hands of Terrance Morgan, 19; Edward Johnson,19; Leslie Litt, 18; and Geblonski Murray, 18. Thornton was attacked in his own driveway, according to CNS News. The teens allegedly pushed him down on the ground and stole his wallet. CNS News' Eric Scheiner described Thornton's life as "a story of hard work, overcoming adversity, belief in God and finding some success in doing something you love." The Associated Press reports that the four individuals accused in Thornton's death are being held without bond. Each of the four suspects is also charged with robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. ========================== And yes, as usual, the black pieces of anti-American Muslim worshipping siht were all wearing O'Bama tee shirts.</Msg><Username>ivanhoe.ofloxly</Username><Timestamp>1382909837010</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 17:37:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382911609283-46</Id><Topic><Title>CRUZ-PALIN ????</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1382897283713</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 14:08:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>many on this board would support that ticket</Msg><Username>junior_the32</Username><Timestamp>1382911609283</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 18:06:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382912049485-47</Id><Title>Wisconsin man brutally attacks Hebrew speakers for speaking ‘Spanish’</Title><Msg>wetbrains are everywhere</Msg><Username>junior_the32</Username><Timestamp>1382912049485</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-27 18:14:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382915137635-48</Id><Title>That was great when Obama said in July of 2009, ...</Title><Msg>“Let me be exactly clear about what health care reform means to you,...
