EGADS!</Title><Msg>Go ahead. Vet my day. A fistful of incoherence. High slurs rambler. Every which way and loose. Clint Eastwood, the 82-year-old movie star and director, inspired what seemed like enthusiasm inside the Republican National Convention's Tampa Bay Times Forum—and disbelief outside it and on Twitter. He also spawned puns, based on the titles of Eastwood's movies—a filmography that runs from 1955 ("Revenge of the Creature") to the present ("Trouble with the Curve"). But in Tampa tonight he may have hit on the performance that will live on forever, as long (at least) as YouTube bloopers endure. Eastwood took on a role made famous by Jack Palance in 1992: geriatric tough guy freestyles surreally on live TV. At that time—during the Oscars broadcast—Billy Crystal chastened Palance, who was determined to show Crystal up by doing a one-armed pushup on stage, by saying, "Decaf, Jack, Decaf." If Palance needed less caffeine, it wasn't clear what Eastwood needed. A script? A director? Red Bull? Eastwood seemed to speak without notes, without a Tele-Prom-Ter and without a clue of what he wanted to say. He shadow-boxed with Obama in a bizarre piece of stagecraft that involved an empty chair. He rambled about how America needed a businessman in charge. He came very close to using the f-word, making several feints at it. And he ran some ongoing gag about how he'd talk as long as he wanted to. The weirdness seemed to discomfit the audience, but also charged them with adrenaline. Weirdness, maybe, was just what this convention needed—a reminder that, however closely choreographed, the conventions are still live events. When Eastwood finally made it off stage—as Twitter called for a hook or a gong to hasten his exit—it seemed he'd gone over time. That might push Romney past 11 pm, which would be disastrous. (The Republican nominee is on as I type.) Commenters initially called it a catastrophe for Romney. But for decades voters have complained that there's no spontaneity at the conventions. Eastwood brought the spontaneity, with the crazy. Who vetted his speech—or failed to? Who cares? He woke up a flagging crowd just in time for Romney's acceptance speech. He may have been incoherent. But live TV is set up exactly for the Good, the Bad and the Spacey. And Eastwood knows how to win attention Every Which You Can.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1346414944598</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 08:09:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346414947418-13</Id><Title>Clint Eastwood- doddering old senile fool very incoherent !

Chris Christie proudly recalled that having grown up in poverty, his father effectively combined his job earnings with his GI Bill benefits, which enabled him to become the first member of his family to obtain a college degree. Has the governor ever thought what his family’s — and other families’ — fortunes might have been had his father and millions of other veterans not taken advantage of that life-changing government spending program? Did the people on the convention floor — screaming “We built it!” — even realize their keynote speaker was living proof how such government assistance turns lives around and that we really are all in this together? Perhaps the Democrats should invite Christie to speak at their convention next week to remind everyone again that often people actually need help to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346421162765</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:52:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346421301933-39</Id><Topic><Title>White Trash Have Been Conditioned To Love Lies &amp; Racist Hate !</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1346420115998</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:35:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as a white man, I am incapable of being racist against whites (by definition)</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1346421301933</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:55:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346421821226-40</Id><Title>Did Chris Cristie</Title><Msg>accept the 2016 nomination last night?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346421821226</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:03:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346422639868-41</Id><Topic><Title>Clint Eastwood- doddering old senile fool very incoherent !

In the past, Rasmussen has been accused of producing biased results that tend to favor Republican candidates. Rasmussen does not include cell phone users, but attempts to compensate by using an “online survey tool to interview randomly selected participants from a demographically diverse panel. In 2010 a study done by the American Research Group found Rasmussen to be the least accurate of the eleven pollsters they evaluated. Rasmussen uses a sample that has “baseline targets” of 35.8% Republicans, 33.0% Democrats, and 31.2% “unaffiliated” voters, despite other surveys that show Democrats' actually outnumbering Republicans in the general population.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346423726296</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:35:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346423875684-45</Id><Topic><Title>White Trash Have Been Conditioned To Love Lies &amp; Racist Hate !</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1346420115998</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:35:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>but you are very much white trash. crying all day on line about why you are not rich while you should be working (magoo is stealing from tax payers) is no way to get rich son.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1346423875684</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:37:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346424309942-46</Id><Topic><Title>POINT NUMBER ONE MITT...PEEEEEEEEEEEEASE</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346382059476</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 23:00:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And in the end Mitt never told us how he plans to do anything.

The Gov made Mitt rich</Title><Msg>Hey Mitt, you didn't build that!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The Federal Bailout That Saved Bain Capital &amp; Mitt Romney Government documents prove the candidate's mythology is just that by: Tim Dickinson Mitt Romney likes to say he won't "apologize" for his success in business. But what he never says is "thank you" – to the American people – for the federal bailout of Bain &amp; Company that made so much of his outsize wealth possible. In fact, government documents on the bailout obtained by Rolling Stone show that the legend crafted by Romney is basically a lie. The federal records, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal that Romney's initial rescue attempt at Bain &amp; Company was actually a disaster – leaving the firm so financially strapped that it had "no value as a going concern." Even worse, the federal bailout ultimately engineered by Romney screwed the FDIC – the bank insurance system backed by taxpayers – out of at least $10 million. And in an added insult, Romney rewarded top executives at Bain with hefty bonuses at the very moment that he was demanding his handout from the feds. … The FDIC considered finding a buyer to take over its loans to Bain, but analysts concluded that "Bain has no value as a going concern." And the government wasn't likely to get much out of Bain if it allowed the firm to go bankrupt: … How had Romney scored such a favorable deal at the FDIC's expense? It didn't hurt that he had close ties to the agency – the kind of "crony capitalism" he now decries. A month before he closed the 1991 loan agreement, Romney promoted a former FDIC bank examiner to become a senior executive at Bain. He also had pull at the top: FDIC chairman Bill Seidman, who had served as finance chair for Romney's father when he ran for president in 1968. The federal documents also reveal that, contrary to Romney's claim that he returned full time to Bain Capital in 1992, he remained involved in bailout negotiations to the very end….</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346427515851</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 11:38:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346427940287-59</Id><Title>Mitt screwed the taxpayers to get rich</Title><Msg>In the end, the government surrendered. At the time, The Boston Globe cited bankers dismissing the bailout as "relatively routine" – but the federal documents reveal it was anything but. The FDIC agreed to accept nearly $5 million in cash to retire $15 million in Bain's debt – an immediate government bailout of $10 million. All told, the FDIC estimated it would recoup just $14 million of the $30 million that Romney's firm owed the government. It was a raw deal – but Romney's threat to loot his own firm had left the government with no other choice. If the FDIC had pushed Bain into bankruptcy, the records reveal, the agency would have recouped just $3.56 million from the firm.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346427940287</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 11:45:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346427969999-60</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt screwed the taxpayers to get rich</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346427940287</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 11:45:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can't wait to see these commercials</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346427969999</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 11:46:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346428402245-61</Id><Topic><Title>Why i wont vote for Obama</Title><Username>darnmadd7</Username><Timestamp>1346426583683</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 11:23:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you have to pay all your medical charges ,you will be on medical real soon and on welfare.By the way i had spinal injuryand operation 17 month ago i am still mostly numb ,but i can walk somen what</Msg><Username>darnmadd7</Username><Timestamp>1346428402245</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 11:53:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346428487922-62</Id><Title>Kudlow: Mitt didn't make the sale.</Title><Msg>Ouch even the die hard conservatives are panning Mitt.

The last night of the Republican National Convention was, by and large, a perfect marriage of form and message. Romney's pitch to voters since the primary has been, "Hey guys, you experimented with electing the black guy with the foreign-sounding name, but now that you've had your fun, it's time to sober up and return power to its rightful owners, boring white guys who think a wild weekend is buying a new set of golf clubs." In service of this message, Romney rolled out a night of endorsements that got across the message loud and clear: Mitt Romney is a comforting, bland white guy in a suit, but one who gets that this is the 21st century. While his personal preference is for a wife who stays home to manage the servants, he's willing to hire those new-fangled modern women. He's a genial grandfather type, so let him carve the turkey already. Then Clint Eastwood spoke. Suddenly, we were all reminded of the raving, Limbaugh-loving cranks lurking right under so many of those traditional business suits and affable golf jokes. Watching Eastwood act out his fantasy of standing over the President and lecturing him like he was an errant schoolboy in need of correction brought forth all the unsavory aspects of modern conservatism Romney desperately wanted to spend last night minimizing. Romney wanted to paint a picture of a conservative movement that has room at the table for the voices of people of color and women. Eastwood looked out at the crowd and said, to wild applause, "I would just like to say something, ladies and gentlemen. Something that I think is very important.

"Not me," said an exasperated-looking senior adviser, when asked who was responsible for Mr. Eastwood's speech. In late-night interviews, aides variously called the speech "strange" and "weird." One described it as "theater of the absurd." Finger-pointing quickly ensued, suggesting real displeasure and even confusion over the handling of Mr. Eastwood's performance, which was kept secret until the last minute.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346434636884</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 13:37:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346435124741-110</Id><Topic><Title>GOP says Obama has failed</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346433737713</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 13:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(he hasn't invaded even one country!!!)

Federal Debt when Obama entered office in January 2009 = $11.1 trillion Current Federal Debt = $16 trillion Obama added 44% or $4.9 trillion to debt during the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. 44% is hardly a triple. Obama has asked the Keystone Pipeline planners to make extra precautions so that the heavy Canadian tar sand oil that sinks in water does not leak into the largest fresh water aquifer which the Keystone would passes over that would wipe out farmers and ranchers and endanger the US food supply. There was a tar sand oil pipeline leak in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 2010 that is still being cleaned up by shaking the riverbed to make the small oil globs rise so they could be collected by hand. Taking extra precautions to protect the US food supply is being responsible to save 300+ million lives versus the rushed Gulf of Mexico BP oil drill and spill method that endangers millions to save a few million$.</Msg><Username>amazing_aces_wild</Username><Timestamp>1346460342023</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 20:45:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346460407708-175</Id><Topic><Title>"SURF" OBSSESSED WITH EASTWOOD!</Title><Username>juniorclassmate</Username><Timestamp>1346459941376</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 20:39:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surf dislocated his weener while watching Clint last night.</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1346460407708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 20:46:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346460676127-176</Id><Topic><Title>How many Obamanurists on this Board????</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346459217725</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 20:26:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If that means you want to have sex with Barry,we have at least three..

This is not a political bashing of Obama. This film explains in detail Obamas life background and clarifies who he is and why he is doing the things he is doing (middle east and Isreal relations, reduction of military and arms, crushing medium to small business, most outragious spending in history,shutting down American oil drilling but tossing our tax money to Brazil to produce oil) Anyone unsure about where this man plans to take our country next term needs to make the time to see the clips nand personal interviews this film has documented. As Americans we must vote not by party but on the values and ideas of the candidates - take the time to be informed on what happenning and what will happen in the future if the "changes" taking place continue!</Msg><Username>swami.chemist</Username><Timestamp>1346471140675</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 23:45:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
