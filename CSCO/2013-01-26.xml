But he didn’t win. Misty Conrad lived, and the woman, who now goes by her former name of Misty Sellars, was in court yesterday, though watching from a protected and separate room, as Fairfield County Common Pleas Judge Richard E. Berens sentenced her now ex-husband to 33 years in prison. Sellars didn’t want to speak in court yesterday, but an aunt read a statement she had written. “When George pulled the trigger, I was left with scars I cannot hide and that people cannot see,” Sellars wrote. “I knew he would either destroy me or bury me before he would let me go.” The Conrads had separated several months before the shooting, and Sellars said yesterday she had been living in fear for months. Conrad had told her he was going to kill her. He’d told others he was going to kill her. So she stayed at different places after the separation as a way to throw him off the trail. She slept each night fully clothed, a cellphone in one hand and her car keys in the other. She kept a container of Mace, a knife, a baseball bat and a can of wasp spray within reach. Eventually, she bought a gun. She changed her schedules, altered her commuting routes. She rearranged the furniture inside her home so that if he ever broke back in, he’d be disoriented. Maybe, she figured, that would buy her a minute to run. She was granted a civil-protection order, and he was slapped with an anti-stalking order. An electronic tracker was strapped to his ankle so authorities would know where he was.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359212551782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:02:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359212774750-13</Id><Topic><Title>Fox Analyst Says GOP ‘Looked Like Weenies’ During Clinton’s Benghazi Hearings</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1359119626446</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 08:13:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ya, as far as I can make out, this was the firstpresidential debate for 2016, Rand loser, GOP losers, winner Hillary!</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359212774750</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:06:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359212888661-14</Id><Topic><Title>If there were gun control laws than guys like this wouldn't be able to protect themselves from their estranged wives, tea billies, LOL GUNS ARE FUN!!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359212551782</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:02:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why dont you quit the kid games and just use one id to try and get your points across?

Bobby Jindal scolded his fellow Republicans for acting like “the stupid party,” which he said damaged their credibility in the last election: In his remarks to the gathering, he also offered some tough medicine for the GOP, including this piece of advice: “We must stop being the stupid party. It’s time for a new Republican party that talks like adults. It’s time for us to articulate our plans and visions for America in real terms. We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments. We’ve had enough of that.” Whether or not Jindal ultimately emerges as a top presidential contender, look for him to be a major presence, not just in Louisiana, but around the country as well as a key figure in helping the party chart its course forward. Of course, this is the same Bobby Jindal who is literally dumbing down Louisiana’s education system by advocating the teaching of creationism in taxpayer-funded schools. Jindal signed into law and vocally supported the ironically-named Louisiana Science Education Act, which has been described as a “thinly veiled attempt to allow creationism into the science classrooms of his state.” Last year, Jindal established a private school voucher program that will bring taxpayer dollars to schools that explicitly teach creationism: Whatever the merits of this program might be, observers in the state were stunned when they saw some of the schools on the list of those eligible to accept the vouchers. They include a school whose students will be taught to “discern and refute the lies commonly found in textbooks,” including, of course, evolution. Another school prepares students to “defend creationism through evidence presented by the Bible,” and yet another assures students that no instruction is included in its textbooks “that would conflict with young earth creationism.” One of the schools funded by Jindal’s program teaches that the alleged existence of the Loch Ness Monster disproves evolution: This 2012-2013 school year, thanks to a bill pushed through by governor Bobby Jindal, thousands of students in Louisiana will receive state voucher money, transferred from public school funding, to attend private religious schools, some of which teach from a Christian curriculum that suggests the Loch Ness Monster disproves evolution and states that the alleged creature, which has never been demonstrated to even exist, has been tracked by submarine and is probably a plesiosaur. The curriculum also claims that a Japanese fishing boat caught a dinosaur. Since Jindal is trying to portray himself as the intellectual savior of the GOP – and thanks to politicians like Rick Perry and Todd Akin it’s a pretty low bar – maybe he can start by repealing the laws that encourage the teaching of pseudo-science in Louisiana’s schools.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359214318188</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 10:31:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359214454137-24</Id><Topic><Title>The news is not very surprising, but it does highlight, as much as anything, Palin's diminished relevance.

Officials say Gary Lynn Wilson, 36, was having his shotgun checked before entering the show when the incident happened. He was unzipping his 12-gauge shotgun's case when it accidentally fired birdshot pellets, hitting three people, The News &amp; Observer in Raleigh reported. All three of the victims were treated at a local hospital for non-life threatening injuries, and the Wake County Sheriff's Department is investigating the incident. Meanwhile, 600 miles to the north, an exhibitor at a Medina, Ohio, gun show accidentally shot his partner when opening a box holding a gun. The victim was shot in the arm and thigh, but the injuries were also not life threatening. And in Indianapolis the same afternoon, a man attending an event accidentally shot himself in the hand while loading his .45 caliber semi-automatic.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359216412915</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 11:06:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359216669984-36</Id><Title>An Impechable offense?</Title><Msg>President now believed to have lip-synced inaugural speech Written by Lyndon Topics: Barack Obama, Beyonce Knowles, Inauguration, lip-synch Friday, 25 January 2013 WASHINGTON, D.C. - After President Obama and Aretha Franklin each gave respectively a resounding speech and rendition of the National Anthem four years ago, it seems that the designers of the second inaugural ceremony pulled a full-on Milli Vanilli on America. Critics say it wasn't immediately obvious that the president was, in fact, mouthing the words to his inaugural speech.

At point, they say, he was asked to leave, then picked up his handgun and shot his daughter in the face. The girl was rushed to Cooper University Hospital where she is listed in critical but stable condition, according to CBS Philly. Authorities said the girl could suffer paralysis as a result of her injuries.

"I never imagined seeing myself in a situation like this and I want to apologize," Israel Gonzalez told Superior Court Judge Robert Devlin. But the judge, while noting the 26-year-old Gonzalez had no previous criminal record, said a severe penalty was warranted. "This was all because you had a stupid gun available. If you didn't have a gun that night, this man wouldn't be dead," Devlin said. Gonzalez, who pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter with a firearm, broke into tears after police later found the wallet on a shelf where Gonzalez forgot he had put it for safe keeping, State's Attorney John Smriga said. On Christmas Day in 2011, police found 29-year-old Noel Cosme lying in a pool of blood on his kitchen floor on Laurel Avenue. He had been shot once in the head. Cosme and his brother had hosted a Christmas party at their home only a short time earlier. When police arrived, they began questioning the victim's brother and Gonzalez, who was standing on the front porch. Police said Gonzalez initially denied knowing anything about the shooting, claiming he had been at a club in Port Chester, N.Y., at the time. However, during the interview, detectives said they noticed blood spatter on Gonzalez's right shoe. When they confronted him again, police said Gonzalez began to cry and confessed to killing Cosme. Gonzalez said when he couldn't find his wallet at the party, he accused Cosme of taking it. When Cosme denied he had the wallet, police said Gonzalez told them he went to his car and retrieved a handgun from under the seat.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359219656494</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:00:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359219882841-48</Id><Topic><Title>Nothing new:</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359212145670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 09:55:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Totalitarian fascist lib Democrat rule is what America needs now.

Tallahassee police said that the boys were playing with a Glock 9mm handgun on Saturday when the gun went off. The bullet went through the 5-year-old's stomach area and out his back. He had surgery on his colon and lower intestines. The 5-year-old told police that the gun belonged to his brother, 22-year-old Cedric Wallace. The 7-year-old told police he saw the younger boy take the gun from Wallace's bedroom. A police report states that there was no evidence that the gun was locked up. Wallace was charged with a second-degree felony which could bring up to 15 years in prison. He was released from jail Sunday after posting a bond.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359221097652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:24:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359221273898-56</Id><Title>If your 4 year old is bored let him play with your gun!!!

Police on Wednesday took hold of another weapon, this time from the back of a father’s sedan. It was too late for 4-year-old Jamarcus Allen, who was shot to death that morning with his dad’s gun. It was too late, as well, for Akron police Chief James Nice and his campaign to combat gun violence that has taken hold in his city. In an interview Thursday, Nice said the circumstances surrounding the child’s death are symbolic of why he wants everyone in Akron, from citizens to judges to legislators, to place greater emphasis and harsher penalties on illegal firearms possession. Nice and his staff have been working for months tracking every gun that officers seized last year — 652 in all, and more than 1,200 the past two years. “It’s every day. It’s just crazy,” the exasperated chief said Thursday. “How is it that so many people in Akron have an illegal gun?” Police have charged Terrance Allen, 48, with involuntary manslaughter. It appears Jamarcus found his father’s 9 mm pistol and fired a shot through his own head. It happened as they drove in a Ford Taurus on South Arlington Street near Davies Avenue. The boy probably was dead when Allen flagged down a Summit County sheriff’s deputy. The officer yanked Jamarcus from his father’s arms and rushed him to a waiting ambulance.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359221273898</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:27:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359221504637-57</Id><Title>That 2 year old should have been packing and protecting herself!!!!</Title><Msg>Niagara Gazette — The Falls man accused of shooting a 2-year-old child in the face has been indicted by a Niagara County grand jury. During an appearance in Falls City Court on Monday, Willie "Boo" Scott Jr. and his lawyer were advised of the grand jury action. The indictment remains sealed until Scott is arraigned on its charges in Niagara County court. That arraignment is expected to take place later this week. Scott was taken into custody on Wednesday by Falls police detectives who had been hunting for him since shortly after the Nov. 27 shooting incident. “He apparently showed up at his lawyer’s office and they called us and said he was ready to turn himself in," Det. Lt. Michael Trane said at the time Scott, 32, was charged with first-degree assault and second-degree criminal use of a firearm. He is accused of being the triggerman who fired into a car parked in front of the Hometown Market, at 17th Street and Pierce Avenue. The shooting took place just after 1 p.m., at a time when the convenience store was busy and people were out walking in the neighborhood. Scott is believed to have been shooting at a man sitting in the front seat of the car. Instead of hitting his target, Scott's bullets slammed into the rear door of the vehicle, striking the child who was seating in the rear seat.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359221504637</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:31:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359221851017-58</Id><Title>Guns are handy if another 12 year old tries to take your girlfriend away!!!

Fox News, Palin cutting ties Jan 25, 7:20 PM (ET) By DAVID BAUDER NEW YORK (AP) - Fox News Channel is parting ways with former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, ending her three-year tenure as a contributor on the network. While Palin's time at Fox was occasionally rocky, the network's news executive, Bill Shine, said Friday that "we have thoroughly enjoyed our association" with her. "We wish her the best in her future endeavors," said Shine, Fox's executive vice president for programming. A person familiar with discussions between Fox and Palin described the parting as amicable, saying that Fox and Palin had discussed renewing her contract but she decided to do other things. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record. Palin's lawyer in Alaska, John Tiemessen, had no immediate comment on her exit. Palin's last appearance on Fox News was Dec. 19 on Greta Van Susteren's show. Palin signed to deliver commentary on Fox in January 2010, reportedly for $1 million a year. It was a coup for both sides at the time; the former Alaska governor was a little more than a year removed from her attention-getting run for the vice presidency and was considered one of the leading contenders for the 2012 presidential nomination. At Fox, she had a platform on the most popular network for conservative viewers. Fox installed equipment in Palin's Wasilla, Alaska, home to make her regular appearances easier. But there were some indications of tension between her and Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes, who was quoted in a 2011 story by The Associated Press saying, "I hired Sarah Palin because she was hot and got ratings." When Palin announced she would not be a candidate in 2012, she said it on a conservative radio show, which didn't sit well with the company paying her to be a contributor. Palin took to her Facebook page late last summer to complain that Fox had cancelled her appearances one night at the GOP national convention; Fox said it was simply because the GOP had to condense its speaker schedule due to a hurricane. Four years removed from her vice presidential candidacy, Palin's influence had waned and she was somewhat overshadowed as a contributor at Fox by Karl Rove, former President George W. Bush's top political aide. Rove recently renewed his contract at Fox through the 2016 election. With four more years of a Barack Obama administration in power, Fox recently hired former Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich as a contributor.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359224366379</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:19:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359224383592-68</Id><Topic><Title>Ted texas hero, like Lance Armstrong</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359146460290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 15:41:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>texans are mentally deficient</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359224383592</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:19:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359224647203-69</Id><Topic><Title>Even Fox Noise FINALLY realized what a</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359224366379</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:19:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow, who knew the GOP convention was run by FOX news, the fair and balanced network, LOL Palin took to her Facebook page late last summer to complain that Fox had cancelled her appearances one night at the GOP national convention; Fox said it was simply because the GOP had to condense its speaker schedule due to a hurricane.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359224647203</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:24:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359224700349-70</Id><Topic><Title>China may be the biggest benefactor in a war that</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1359224176153</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:16:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now hold on there, what about the billions of dollars #$%$ Cheney and his Halliburton buddies made off of those no bid contracts?

That was something that Congress specifically prevented the CDC from doing. "There is absolutely no question. These are preventable deaths," said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, who used to oversee research into gun violence and prevention at the Centers for Disease Control. In 1996, the NRA successfully lobbied Congress to put this restriction into the CDC's budget: "None of the funds made available ... may be used to advocate or promote gun control." "These were shots fired across the bow," said Rosenberg, "and they the terrorized people at the CDC. And they terrorized researchers who said, 'Whoa, this is scary. I don't want my funding jeopardized.'" 9 in 10 back universal gun background checks NRA president: Gun control measures "feel-good proposals that won't work" NRA: We didn't get a chance to oppose N.Y. law Poll: 6 in 10 favor tougher gun laws The NRA was infuriated with a 1993 study sponsored by the CDC that concluded having a gun at home offered little protection, but it increased almost three-fold the risk of one family member shooting another. CDC funding into gun violence research has plummeted 96 percent since 1996, to just $100,000 of last year's $5.6 billion CDC budget. Asked if gun violence a legitimate public health issue Bob Barr, a former Georgia congressman who sits on the board of the NRA, responded, "Absolutely not." Barr added: "The issue of firearms violence is handled and ought to be handled as a law enforcement matter. We don't need government involved in this. It is all about the big C: control." The next step is up to Congress whether to approve President Obama's request for $10 million to study this issue of gun violence.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359240839146</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 17:53:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359241016909-102</Id><Topic><Title>JUNIOR AND DUMBIVAN BEATEN ON INDIA BUS</Title><Username>wildwoolywabbit</Username><Timestamp>1359231808034</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 15:23:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>in case you haven't noticed Politics DOES affect stocks, our economy, the world economy, our standard of living and our very freedoms *** Of course!

We are calling on members of Congress and state legislators to pass common sense gun safety laws to stop the epidemic of preventable child and adult gun deaths. Others are marching in Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, San Antonio, Jersey City, and in communities across the country. Grassroots groups are coming together in the wake of the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Mothers and fathers, grandparents, pastors, gun violence survivors, law enforcement officers, elected officials, child advocates, and everyone who believes that our children’s right to live, learn and grow up safely must be protected before guns, must not stop marching, calling, writing, and visiting and holding our political leaders accountable. We must vote them out if they do not act to end the preventable and immoral loss of child and human lives and honor what most Americans want and our children need. A new Gallup poll shows that most Americans support universal background checks for gun buyers, a ban on assault weapons, limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds or less, and other proposals in President Obama’s Plan to Reduce Gun Violence. It will be a formidable fight to achieve these essential steps but we can and will succeed if all of us raise an irresistible and unrelenting voice in every state in the weeks and months to come, and for as long as it takes. Don’t let anyone tell you current gun safety regulations are working just fine. They aren’t. The massacre at Sandy Hook woke up many Americans to the epidemic of gun violence, which has snuffed out the lives of 148,000 children since 1968 -- this is the equivalent of 7,400 classrooms of 20 children and teens. Every 30 minutes a child or teen is shot in the United States. Every 3 hours and 15 minutes a child dies from gun violence. It’s time to say “no more.” Epidemic gun violence against children—and its toll on all who live in the United States—is a uniquely American phenomenon. In 2010 the U.S. gun death rate -- homicides, suicides, and accidents -- for children and teens was nearly 65 times higher than the rates in the United Kingdom and Germany and 108 times higher than in Spain. The U.S. gun homicide rate for children and teens was 106 times higher than the rate in Germany and 213 times higher than the rates in Spain and the United Kingdom.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359243069005</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:31:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359243518715-110</Id><Topic><Title>SANDY HOOK LIBS PROTEST LIB KILLER'S ACCESS TO GUNS IN DC</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1359241595917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 18:06:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stephen King -- all the shooters have been found to have the book.

I have no problem with your homosexuality, people are people and I don't judge them, that is God's job, but you would be much happier and have a lot less hatred if you just accepted who you are.

Police said they responded to a possible shooting call around 5:45 p.m. Thursday on Morris Street. Officials found 15-year-old Matthew Daniels with a gunshot wound. His mother was performing CPR but officers immediately took over. Daniels was a freshman at Sweetwater High School, where students and teachers are working to absorb the loss of the beloved student. He was just walking the school's hallways with his classmates on Thursday, a mere couple of hours before he died. As the shock settles in, they're focusing on the memories of who he was. Sweetwater High School Principal David Watts knew Daniels his entire life and said he was one of those kids you never had to worry about. He was just born doing right and was a friend to everyone. "Matthew Daniels was a great kid. I don't think I ever saw Matt without a smile on his face. You never hear another kid say anything about him but fun and how he would tell jokes and laugh," said Watts. Daniels was an honor student, had just been named Student of the Month and was toying with the idea of trying out for the baseball team. It's hard to believe he's really gone, especially for his close friends. "That group that walked home everyday has had that friendship severed by death. It's hard for them. Here everybody hurts so everybody grieves together," said Watts. "I don't think when someone is gone you ever really replace them. The loss is hard but now it's the going on from the loss and how we deal with it." In an effort to help students and teachers deal with the loss they're feeling, the school's faculty is hosting a memorial assembly in the school gym Sunday afternoon. Students and their parents are welcomed to attend. They will also have grief counselors at school next week to help students work through the pain. "We have to encourage our kids to remember Matt in a good light. Not for the fact that he's gone but for the fact of how much joy Matt brought all our lives while he was here," said Watts.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359253367408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 21:22:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359253887848-132</Id><Title>Car kills family of 4</Title><Msg>Nobody cares ESPECIALLY Dumb Dumb that it was a drunk driver, the car killed them.

(WTVR) – The Richmond man shot by a four-year-old child has died, according to Richmond Police. Police identified the man as 58-year-old Casper R. Jones. Police found Jones Sunday morning after they responded to his home in the 2300 hundred block o Whitcomb Street home for a shooting call. Police said a child, a relative who was in the home, shot Jones on accident. Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Mike Herring says the child found the gun on a table inside the home. Herring says investigators are looking into evidence of child neglect but has declined to say if any charges will be filed in the case. The accidental shooting comes on the heels of a recent report by the Children’s Defense Fund that shows an alarming number of children across the country have easy access to guns. According the report, released January 11: 1/3 of all households with children younger than 18 have a gun 40% of gun-owning households with children store guns unlocked 22% of children with gun-owning parents admit to handling guns in home without parents’ permission Gun-control advocate Andrew Goddard says Sunday’s tragedy is proof that gun organizations and groups need to be more proactive in pushing safety education.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359257185147</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 22:26:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359257330300-138</Id><Topic><Title>The news is not very surprising, but it does highlight, as much as anything, Palin's diminished relevance.
