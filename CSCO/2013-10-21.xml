Calcutta, India. Gunmen associated with Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami attack the U.S. Consulate. Five people are killed. June 14, 2002. Karachi, Pakistan. Suicide bomber connected with al Qaeda attacks the U.S. Consulate, killing 12 and injuring 51. October 12, 2002. Denpasar, Indonesia. U.S. diplomatic offices bombed as part of a string of "Bali Bombings." No fatalities. February 28, 2003. Islamabad, Pakistan. Several gunmen fire upon the U.S. Embassy. Two people are killed. May 12, 2003. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Armed al Qaeda terrorists storm the diplomatic compound, killing 36 people including nine Americans. The assailants committed suicide by detonating a truck bomb. July 30, 2004. Tashkent, Uzbekistan. A suicide bomber from the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan attacks the U.S. Embassy, killing two people. December 6, 2004. Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Al Qaeda terrorists storm the U.S. Consulate and occupy the perimeter wall. Nine people are killed. March 2, 2006. Karachi, Pakistan again. Suicide bomber attacks the U.S. Consulate killing four people, including U.S. diplomat David Foy who was directly targeted by the attackers. (I wonder if Lindsey Graham or Fox News would even recognize the name "David Foy." This is the third Karachi terrorist attack in four years on what's considered American soil.) September 12, 2006. Damascus, Syria. Four armed gunmen shouting "Allahu akbar" storm the U.S. Embassy using grenades, automatic weapons, a car bomb and a truck bomb. Four people are killed, 13 are wounded. January 12, 2007. Athens, Greece. Members of a Greek terrorist group called the Revolutionary Struggle fire a rocket-propelled grenade at the U.S. Embassy. No fatalities. March 18, 2008. Sana'a, Yemen. Members of the al-Qaeda-linked Islamic Jihad of Yemen fire a mortar at the U.S. Embassy. The shot misses the embassy, but hits nearby school killing two. July 9, 2008. Istanbul, Turkey. Four armed terrorists attack the U.S. Consulate. Six people are killed. September 17, 2008. Sana'a, Yemen. Terrorists dressed as military officials attack the U.S. Embassy with an arsenal of weapons including RPGs and detonate two car bombs. Sixteen people are killed, including an American student and her husband (they had been married for three weeks when the attack occurred). This is the second attack on this embassy in seven months. A few observations about this timeline. My initial list was quoted from an article on the Daily Kos which actually contained several errors and only 11 attacks (the above timeline contains all 13 attacks). Also, my list above doesn't include the numerous and fatal attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad during the Iraq war -- a war that was vocally supported by Lindsey Graham, John McCain and Fox News Channel. Karl Rove was part of the Bush administration whose lax oversight over our embassies and consulates allowed them to be attacked 13 times while he was part of that office, with 10 of those attacks resulting in fatalities. Those 10 attacks over 8 years resulted in far more than 4 consulate/embassy staff being killed. In those 10 attacks, 70 lives were lost. Of those attacks, the ones that trouble me the most were the three that happened at on one consulate - the consulate in Karachi, Pakistan. The 1st attack on the Karachi consulate occured in 2002 with 12 being killed. The 2nd attack occured in 2003 with 2 more being killed; the final attack occured in 2006 with 4 being killed - this time one of those dying was a diplomat. Three attacks over 4 years with 18 people losing their lives and yet the Bush Administration did nothing after the 1st attack to provide additional security. And yet, Karl Rove has the nerve to appear on Faux News and raise questions about the attack on Benghazi, which was the only deadly overseas attack in 5 years, and try to create some kind of scandal. This comming from a man who has the blood of more than 4,000 Americans on his hands and was part of an administration that allowed 13 attacks on our overseas offices to take place in 8 years while doing nothing, is simply unconscionable.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382352459687</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 06:47:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382354338639-5</Id><Title>Obama should have listened to Ted Cruz!!</Title><Msg>Now we find out that Ted Cruz was much smarter than Obama concerning Obamacide!

But he's truly been on fire lately, cracking some of the best jokes we've come across during the government shutdown madness. Here's a compilation of our 10 favorite Andy Borowitz one-liners so far: 1. "I wasn't happy about the country being controlled by the richest one percent, but I really hate it being controlled by the dumbest one percent." 2. "The party that professes to worry about the deficit just cost the nation billions of dollars for no reason whatsoever: WELL DONE." 3. "It bothers me that our country may be pushed into default by people who cannot spell default." 4. "As the Republicans go from Abraham Lincoln to Teddy Roosevelt to Ted Cruz, it's no wonder they don't believe in evolution." 5. "Just bought health insurance online. For some weird reason, the country was not destroyed. Anyone else have this problem?" 6. "Boehner: 'The President is stubbornly refusing to end this crisis I created.'" 7. "This seems like an awful lot of trouble just to keep poor people from seeing a doctor." 8. "BREAKING: GOP Accuse Obama of Acting Like He Won Election" 9. "Call me an optimist, but I believe our government will come up with a totally unsatisfactory solution to a completely unnecessary crisis." 10. "Say what you will about America, it's a place where any child, if he's stupid enough, can grow up to wreck the world economy."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382355548557</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 07:39:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382356106047-13</Id><Title>If GOP wants to make changes- Present something, Get Elected- "Don't Break it [the gov't]</Title><Msg>YES SIR, PRESIDENT OBAMA!

And the CNN/ORC International survey also indicates that more than six in 10 Americans say that Speaker of the House John Boehner should be replaced. The poll was conducted Friday through Sunday, just after the end of the 16-day partial federal government shutdown that was caused in part by a push by House conservatives to try and dismantle the health care law, which is President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement. According to the survey, 54% say it's a bad thing that the GOP controls the House, up 11 points from last December, soon after the 2012 elections when the Republicans kept control of the chamber. Only 38% say it's a good thing the GOP controls the House, a 13-point dive from the end of last year.</Msg><Username>junior_the32</Username><Timestamp>1382357237085</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 08:07:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382357421788-22</Id><Topic><Title>gop slide</Title><Username>junior_the32</Username><Timestamp>1382357237085</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 08:07:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“Many Republicans searching for something to say in defense of the disastrous shutdown strategy will say President Obama just doesn’t try hard enough to communicate with Republicans.

This is how Greg Collett, a two-time Republican candidate for Idaho's state House, defends himself against charges of hypocrisy for the fact that, while "I don’t think that the government should be involved in health care or health insurance," his 10 kids are on Medicaid: Am I a hypocrite for participating in programs that I oppose? If it was that simple, and if participation demonstrated support, then of course. But, my reason for participation in government programs often is not directly related to that issue in and of itself, and it certainly does not demonstrate support. For instance, I participate in government programs in order to stay out of the courts, or jail, so that I can take care of my family; other things I do to avoid fines or for other financial reasons; and some are simply because it is the only practical choice. With each situation, I have to evaluate the consequences of participating or not participating. Hmm. Okay, the staying out of jail thing makes some sense. But that hardly explains the "taking government health care for your kids" part, which seems to fall under his much broader category of using government services "for other financial reasons." Or "because it is the only practical choice." No discussion of why one might oppose something despite finding it to be the only practical choice. If you're curious what government services Collett uses even though he opposes them, assess how much time you have, because the list, it is long: By way of example, here are a few government programs and policies that I oppose because they do not conform to the proper role of government, yet I participate in them: I am against marriage licenses, but I still got one to get married; I am against the foster care program, but I became a foster parent; I am against property taxes, but I own property and pay the tax; I am against federal ownership of land by the Forest Service and BLM, but I use the land for hiking, backpacking, camping, and fishing; I am against national parks, but I visit them; I am against driver's licenses, vehicle registration, license plates, and mandated liability insurance, but I comply with all of them to drive; I am against public funding of transportation systems, but I still use them; I am against building permits, fees, and inspections, but I get them as needed; I am against public libraries, but my family uses them; I am against public schools, but I occasionally use their facilities; I am against occupational licensing, but I use the services of individuals and companies that comply with those requirements; I am against USDA inspections, but I still use products that carry their label; I am against the Uniform Commercial Code and designated legal business entities such as corporations, but I use the services of such entities and have set up several of them for myself; I am against the current structure of our judicial system and courts, but I still use them; I am against the 17th Amendment, but I still cast my vote for Senators; and the list could go on and on.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382359439970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 08:43:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382359895408-27</Id><Title>Republicans lobby for Terrorist</Title><Msg>They destroy our nation</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1382359895408</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 08:51:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382359965671-28</Id><Title>SOUTH lost the Civil War</Title><Msg>Why don't you accept it</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1382359965671</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 08:52:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382360120155-29</Id><Title>Wow!

He went on to describe studying for a pathology test with friends in the library.

The official Web site of Obamacare, HealthCare.gov, has been plagued by glitches, crashes, and sluggishly loading pages, say millions of angry Americans attempting to log on to the site at exactly the same time. “Look, I know that we had to wait longer for health care than virtually every other industrialized nation on earth,” said Tracy Klugian, a muffler salesman from Akron, Ohio. “But the time I spent on that Web site is thirty-five minutes I’ll never get back.” Sharing what he called his “Obamacare horror story,” Mr. Klugian said, “Being on that Web site slowed down our wi-fi so much that my kids couldn’t stream videos. For a so-called health-care program, it’s causing a lot of stress that’s the opposite of healthy, if you ask me.” Harland Dorrinson, a gym manager from Knoxville, Tennessee, had an Obamacare nightmare of his own, having to log on to the site “two completely different times” before getting health insurance for the first time in his life. “President Obama said he was going to make health care affordable and available to millions of Americans,” he said, bitterly. “He didn’t tell us it would take more than an hour.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382363244889</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 09:47:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382363585934-42</Id><Topic><Title>REPUBS- deny evolution, global warming, and debt ceiling financial disaster</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo3</Username><Timestamp>1382357767715</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 08:16:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump!</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo3</Username><Timestamp>1382363585934</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 09:53:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382363853497-43</Id><Title>There is no alternative</Title><Msg>ACA addresses major cost drivers in an attempt to bend the curve of what appears to be inherent rising costs.

Marco Rubio (R-FL) on Sunday said that President Barack Obama must cave to House Republicans' demands on immigration reform because he had "undermined" the effort by refusing to defund his signature health care reform law. During an interview with Fox News, Rubio reasoned that since the Obama administration had delayed parts of the Affordable Care Act, it could also decide to selectively enforce parts of any new immigration reform law. "Certainly, the president has undermined this effort because the way he's behaved over the last three weeks [during the government shutdown]," he explained to Fox News host Chris Wallace. But even after House Republicans shut the government down in an attempt to defund the Affordable Care Act and took the country to the brink of default by threatening to raise the debt limit, Rubio argued that those same lawmakers might have the best immigration reform solution. "This notion that they're going to get into a room and negotiate a deal with the president on immigration is much more difficult for two reasons," he explained. "Number one, because the way the president has behaved towards his opponents over the last three weeks as well as the White House and the things that they've said and done. And number two, because what I have outlined to you... So, I certainly think that immigration reform is a lot harder to achieve today than it was just three weeks ago because of what's happened here." "Again, I think the House deserves the time and space to have its own ideas on how they want to move forward on this, let's see what they come up with. It could very well be much better than what than the Senate has done so far."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382366427452</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 10:40:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382366642745-50</Id><Topic><Title>Why in the world would Hillary Clinton or Hussein Obama II,</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1382320668142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 21:57:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So gfo99 and Hillary Clinton says "What difference does it make"?

Many people may chalk up that misfortune to overspending or a lavish lifestyle, but a new study suggests that more than 60 percent of people who go bankrupt are actually capsized by medical bills. Expert: "Medical bills ... are an issue that can very easily and in pretty short order overwhelm a lot families." Bankruptcies due to medical bills increased by nearly 50 percent in a six-year period, from 46 percent in 2001 to 62 percent in 2007, and most of those who filed for bankruptcy were middle-class, well-educated homeowners, according to a report that will be published in the August issue of The American Journal of Medicine. "Unless you're a Warren Buffett or Bill Gates, you're one illness away from financial ruin in this country," says lead author Steffie Woolhandler, M.D., of the Harvard Medical School, in Cambridge, Mass. "If an illness is long enough and expensive enough, private insurance offers very little protection against medical bankruptcy, and that's the major finding in our study."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382369804204</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:36:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382369937858-60</Id><Topic><Title>Why in the world would Hillary Clinton or Hussein Obama II,</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1382320668142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 21:57:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior I used to think, all given - a good amount of blacks were smart, you and Obama certainly turned that school of thought around</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1382369937858</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:38:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382370120251-61</Id><Topic><Title>Why in the world would Hillary Clinton or Hussein Obama II,</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1382320668142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 21:57:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>are those your 4 boyfriends?</Msg><Username>pete_king_says_tedcruz_a_fraud</Username><Timestamp>1382370120251</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:42:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382370141036-62</Id><Topic><Title>Why in the world would Hillary Clinton or Hussein Obama II,</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1382320668142</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-20 21:57:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>uhhhh, because they are selfish, myopic pinko dem pigs?</Msg><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1382370141036</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:42:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382370376502-63</Id><Title>HILLARY BENGHAZI CLINTON</Title><Msg>The real event that made her forever unelectable as a president, that, and being a total stumpy, doormat, pig</Msg><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1382370376502</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:46:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382370434270-64</Id><Topic><Title>HILLARY BENGHAZI CLINTON</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1382370376502</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:46:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol your next president goober</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382370434270</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:47:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382370486178-65</Id><Topic><Title>HILLARY BENGHAZI CLINTON</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1382370376502</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:46:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol in your wetdreams dumbo</Msg><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1382370486178</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:48:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382370529794-66</Id><Title>BENGHAZI- ONLY 4 people deceased.</Title><Msg>And none of you hypocrites really ever did care about TYRONE, did you?</Msg><Username>pete_king_says_tedcruz_a_fraud</Username><Timestamp>1382370529794</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:48:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382370602235-67</Id><Topic><Title>BENGHAZI- ONLY 4 people deceased.</Title><Username>pete_king_says_tedcruz_a_fraud</Username><Timestamp>1382370529794</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 11:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Look at Magoo trying to get some attention.

Speaking from an undisclosed location in Russia, Mr. Snowden said he hacked the Web site over the weekend and thinks he is “pretty sure what the problem is.” “Look, this thing was built terribly,” he said. “It’s a government Web site, O.K.?” Mr. Snowden said that if an immunity deal can be worked out, “I can get to work on this thing right away—I don’t need a password.” In addition to full immunity, Mr. Snowden said he is requesting that he be allowed to work from home. At the White House, President Obama offered a muted response to Mr. Snowden’s proposal: “Edward Snowden is a traitor who has compromised our national security. Having said that, if he knows why we keep getting those error messages, that could be a conversation.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382372744638</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 12:25:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1382372904945-91</Id><Title>MAGOO AS USUAL IS LYING BY SAYING PEOPLE ARE SIGNING UP EN MASSE FOR OBAMACARE</Title><Msg>the opposite is true.

The CNN/ ORC International survey — conducted Oct. 18-20, after the end of the partial government shutdown — found that 54 percent of those surveyed think it's a bad thing that the GOP controls the House, up 11 points since the same poll in December. Just 38 percent say Republican control is a good thing, a 13-point decrease from the end of last year. This is the first time since Republicans won back control of the House in 2010 that a majority believes GOP control of the chamber is a bad thing. The survey of 841 adults also found that more than 60 percent of Americans think House Speaker John Boehner, the Ohio Republican, should be replaced. "John Boehner fares just as badly as the GOP," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. "Sixty-three percent of all Americans think that Boehner should be replaced as speaker of the House, a view shared by roughly half of all Republicans." Meanwhile, the survey found that the approval rating for Congress remains near an all-time low. Just 12 percent of respondents said they approve of the job Congress is doing while 86 percent disapprove. This compares to 44 percent who approve of the job President Barack Obama is doing compared to 52 percent who say they disapprove. "Barack Obama's numbers are pretty anemic, but he remains in much better shape than the GOP," Holland said. "Even though Obama's approval rating remains stuck in the mid-40s, it didn't take a hit during the shutdown: 44 percent just before the shutdown began; 44 percent now."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382373311136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 12:35:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382373435947-97</Id><Topic><Title>jayallstar... some low life in Alaska......... follower of Sarah Palin and all other rednecks who do</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo3</Username><Timestamp>1382373347394</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 12:35:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>back to your usual ad hom comments eh magoo?

Tim Griffin (R-Ark.) announced Monday that he will not run for a third term. "We have decided that now is the time for me to focus intently on my top priority, my family, as Elizabeth and I raise our two young children,” he told Talk Business Arkansas. “To that end, I will not seek reelection to a third term. I will complete my second term, but I have made no decision as to my plans after Congress except that I will continue in public service, including as a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve." The announcement comes as something of a surprise, considering that Griffin appeared to have a full-fledged reelection campaign going. He raised over $208,000 in the third quarter of 2013 for his reelection and had over $540,000 in cash on hand, despite having no announced Democratic opponent. The congressman blasted President Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for their "violent rhetoric" in a recent tweet sent while the U.S. Capitol was on lockdown due to shots fired. He later deleted the tweet.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1382374118196</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 12:48:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382374236856-104</Id><Topic><Title>IS IT JUST ME OR DID OBAMA LOOK LIKE ON TV TONIGHT THAT by jaysallstarss • Sep 10, 2013 10:11 PM</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo3</Username><Timestamp>1382373969759</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 12:46:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awww now, a polite "no" would've sufficed.

As well he might have: it had won in a blowout. The extremism of our own age—Tea Party extremism—“contaminates the whole Republican brand,” as David Frum has written. And he’s right. But Tea Party extremism is not, as this implies, a betrayal of the party’s belief system. It is, instead, a crystallization, a highly potent concentrate, of the party’s belief system. The free-market dogmatism, the tax-cut catechism, the abhorrence of nuance and science and government and fact—these did not bubble up during town-hall meetings in 2010 but flow from the same deep well from which establishment Republicans like Mitch McConnell (Goldwaterites, all) have long been drinking. Frum and other sensible conservatives yearn for a Tea Party exit—maybe even an expulsion—from the G.O.P. But it cannot be expelled, because in this case the parasite is a creation—in some ways a perfection—of the host organism itself.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382376427660</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 13:27:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382376551359-110</Id><Topic><Title>NO ONE HAS ENROLLED AT THE STATE WEBSITE OF NEW YORK FOR OBAMACARE</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1382372028274</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 12:13:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought it was 300 trillion, no?

"We believe the suspect has been neutralized," the Sparks Police Department said on its website, without further details. Angela Rambo, spokeswoman for Renown Regional Hospital, said the hospital had received two male patients, both minors, and both were in critical condition. Kyle Nucum, 13, told the Gazette-Journal that he witnessed another student shoot his teacher. Nucum said his teacher saw the student with a gun and ran to the student to tell him to put the gun down. He was then shot.

And belief pretty clearly breaks down along partisan lines: 34 percent of Republicans and 35 percent of Independents believe a global power elite is conspiring to create a New World Order—compared to just 15 percent of Democrats. Fifty-eight percent of Republicans believe global warming is a hoax; 77 percent of Democrats do not. Sixty-two percent of Republicans and 38 percent of Independents believe the Obama administration is “secretly trying to take everyone’s guns away.” Only 14 percent of Democrats agree. Forty-two percent of Republicans believe Shariah law is making its way into U.S. courts, compared to just 12 percent of Democrats. More than twice as many Republican voters (21 percent) as Democrats (9 percent) believe the government is using “false flag incidents” to consolidate its power. Forty-four percent of Republicans and 21 percent of Independents believe that Obama is making plans to stay in office after his second term expires. Only 11 percent of Democrats agree. Most elected officials who traffic in conspiracy theories are too rich and successful themselves to believe in them; they deploy them opportunistically, to push voters’ emotional buttons. As Michael Tomasky wrote in The Daily Beast last week, “The rage kept the base galvanized….The rich didn’t really share the rage, or most of them. Even the Koch Brothers probably don’t….But all of them have used it. And they have tolerated it, the casual racism, the hatred of gay people, and the rest….because they, the elites, remained in charge. Well, they’re not in charge now. The snarling dog they kept in a pen for decades has just escaped and bitten their hand off.” Back in the winter of 2012, a couple of weeks before my book “The New Hate: A History of Fear and Loathing on the Populist Right” was published, I was at a party at my sister’s house, and she introduced me to the husband of a friend of hers, a lawyer active in the Democratic party. I told him how conspiratorial memes about the Illuminati have echoed down to us from the 1790s, and how the influence of fringe groups like the John Birch Society extends beyond marginal figures like Alex Jones and Ron Paul and can even be discerned in the GOP’s campaign rhetoric.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1382401979076</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 20:32:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382402205846-184</Id><Topic><Title>TEA PARTY OPPOSED OBAMA CARE AND SHUT DOWN THE GOVT...but Democrats fought against the people</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1382379885790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 14:24:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>slight error Walter dems shoved it up Americas Arrrss the preferred lib way..</Msg><Username>gelinasalan</Username><Timestamp>1382402205846</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-21 20:36:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1382402465182-185</Id><Topic><Title>THE AFFORDABLE SCAM ACT IS NOT JUST A WEBSITE, it is supposed to be a whole lot more!
