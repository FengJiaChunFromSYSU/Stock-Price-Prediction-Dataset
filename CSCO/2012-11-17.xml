Not only does chronic stress damage tissues in the body through the continual exposure to harmful stress hormones, it also makes you no fun to be around and even interferes with your sleep. This can lead to having fewer friends and a negative outlook (see below). To shorten your life expectancy: avoid relaxation techniques, take everything very personally and try to take on more than is humanly possible.

Paul LePage joined more than a dozen GOP governors who have notified the administration they will not set up state insurance exchanges next year, instead leaving the job to the federal government. Kasich's decision drew quick praise from House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio). "I'm proud of my governor … for taking a stand and resisting the federal takeover of healthcare in Ohio," said Boehner, who just last week seemed ready to soften the GOP campaign against the law, pronouncing, "Obamacare is the law of the land." You gotta love the baggers, LOL only in the rabbit hole. Let's think for a second, the gopper states don't set up state run exchanges and instead turn the job over to the Federal Government and this says Boehner is resisting the federal takeover. Only baggers can understand the logic in turning something over to the Federal Government as a way of not having the Federal Government control it.

The BBC, which has been an enemy of Israel for years, even going so far as to quote as an authority noted Israel hater Richard Falk, who has compared Israelis to Nazis, has now been caught cutting a video showing a “victim” of the Israeli attack on Gaza being carried out, seriously wounded. One problem. In the same video thirty seconds later, the same man is standing on his own two feet. It’s a miracle! The BBC’s hostility to Israel has been evidenced by acts like these: BBC journalist Barbara Plett said she “started to cry” when Yasser Arafat left Israel and traveled to France for medical treatment in 2004. In 2006, reporter Orla Guerin lied that the town of Bint Jbeil, Lebanon, had been “wiped out” by the Israeli air force. It later turned out that the suburbs were left virtually untouched. When the Fogel family of five was butchered in their home, including a baby girl in her bed, in Itamar, the BBC barely mentioned it, saying that it had been a “very busy news period.” On October 5th of this year, Jeremy Bowen, the BBC’s Middle East Editor, retweeted a tweet by one Joseph Dana, who was “curious that Israeli forces can fire tear gas and use stun grenades next to the Al Aqsa mosque and the story doesn’t make international waves.” The chances of this happening are slim and none; the Al Aqsa Mosque is one of the most explosive places on earth. What actually happened was this: several hundred Arab worshippers stoned the Israeli police, an Arab man tried to stab a police officer, and then the Israeli police dispersed the crowd. Of course, Dana lives in Ramallah, and hates Israel so much that, when he spoke in November 2011 at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, he stated that he had managed to extricate himself from a “Zionist indoctrination programme.” No wonder the BBC thinks a Palestinian acting a part is really wounded. The BBC has been acting like an objective news source for years.

Thursday late afternoon a british friend of mine and I decided to revive some of our street fighting years and took to the streets with the Catalans. Choppers flying, people chanting, tear gas launchers booming. Oh the good ol' days when us Americans used to do this things. It all ended up in one big mess at the Gothic district. We got quite a bit of tear gas that later on we washed with some Estrella beer and some tapas in one of the few bars that was left open, as most of Spain had shut down. Friday everything went back to normal. Maybe I am just seeing the big cities but if the Spaniards are hurting they are complaining but they don't seem to be stopping their drinking, eating, and nightly partying. I hadn't been to Spain in quite a while and the spending of the past seems evident in grand new airports, high speed trains (I took the 11AM today) and new highways, and beautiful well kept cities. They might be in debt but they certainly spent it right.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1353190365543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 17:12:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353190886975-102</Id><Topic><Title>REPORT FROM THE BARRICADES, I TAKE SOME TEAR GAS AND IT IS A BLAST...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1353190365543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 17:12:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you in to paint sniffing,Magoo??

As recently as a week ago, a global auto parts manufacturing company in Ohio known as Dana Holding Corp., warned their employees of potential layoffs, citing "$24 million over the next six years in additional U.S. health care expenses". After laying off several white collar staffers, company insiders have hinted at more to come. The company will have to cover the additional $24 million cost somehow, which will likely equate to numerous cuts in their current workforce of 25,500 worldwide. Stryker One of the biggest medical device manufacturers in the world, Stryker will close their facility in Orchard Park, New York, eliminating 96 jobs in December. Worse, they plan on countering the medical device tax in Obamacare by slashing 5% of their global workforce - an estimated 1,170 positions. Boston Scientific In October of 2009, Boston Scientific CEO Ray Elliott, warned that proposed taxes in the health care reform bill could "lead to significant job losses" for his company. Nearly two years later, Elliott announced that the company would be cutting anywhere between 1,200 and 1,400 jobs, while simultaneously shifting investments and workers overseas - to China. Medtronic In March of 2010, medical device maker Medtronic warned that Obamacare taxes could result in a reduction of precisely 1,000 jobs. That plan became reality when the company cut 500 positions over the summer, with another 500 set for the end of 2013. Others A short list of other companies facing future layoffs at the hands of Obamacare: Smith &amp; Nephew - 770 layoffs Abbott Labs - 700 layoffs Covidien - 595 layoffs Kinetic Concepts - 427 layoffs St. Jude Medical - 300 layoffs Hill Rom - 200 layoffs A lot of other businesses are going to reduce the number of employees they have or reduce the average work week in order to avoid the Obamacare insurance coverage mandate that will soon be implemented.</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1353197111308</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 19:05:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353197380286-117</Id><Title>My tin cup is out...</Title><Msg>...Where's all my free stuff Obama?!?!?!?!</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1353197380286</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 19:09:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353197400539-118</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA LAID OFF 35,000 POSTAL WORKERS IN 2012 MORE TO COME</Title><Username>chick_fil_a_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1353189236770</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 16:53:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Obama it is a giant mistake?"
