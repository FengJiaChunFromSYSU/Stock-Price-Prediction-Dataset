Police in several states have already been issued with special knives and anesthetics so they can clamp down on offenders and reduce gun crime immediately. The President, invoking his executive privilege, is also considering ordering that anyone with a mental illness, irrelevant if they own a weapon or not, must also have their trigger fingers removed, in an attempt to prevent crazed people from firing weapons, should they still manage to purchase them. "What a fantastic idea, if we can't ban guns and we are upsetting legitimate gun owners then this is a great compromise" tweeted Piers Morgan to his millions of followers. In a follow up tweet he also added "A fantastic deterrent that could be the basis for further changes in the law. I mean why stop here? I guarantee that we can stop public urination by applying the same logic. Only yesterday I was commenting how badly the CNN parking garage smelled of urine.....I suspected Anderson Cooper was the culprit, but irrelevant of who it is.....if we start amputating offenders then the problem will naturally stop."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358855560283</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 06:52:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358855600281-4</Id><Topic><Title>100% UNEMPLOYMENT IS OK AS LONG AS GOVERMENT PAYS ALL MY BILLS</Title><Username>loretta_sanchez_is_smart</Username><Timestamp>1358828407892</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:20:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obamaUtopia.</Msg><Username>kvbjho234</Username><Timestamp>1358855600281</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 06:53:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358856626999-5</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA = MODERN DAY ROBIN HOOD HE IS A TRUE HERO</Title><Username>pancho_villa_gomez</Username><Timestamp>1358833421877</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 00:43:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not to worry, Mitch McConnel said he is certain that this is Obama's last term in office.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358856626999</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 07:10:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358856791422-6</Id><Title>The VIX is now at 12, keep buying boyz</Title><Msg>they will hit you over the head with a 2x4 when you least expect it.</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1358856791422</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 07:13:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358860141702-7</Id><Topic><Title>The VIX is now at 12, keep buying boyz</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1358856791422</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 07:13:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stock market will surge for Obama.

They all agree that income disparity is at all time highs not seen since the beginning of the last great depression. The problem is the rich have jerrry rigged the system so they get all the winnings and the middle class gets screwed. Even if they mess up and bankrupt the banks they still get giant bonuses and the middle class pays to bail them out. No middle class, no middle class jobs. #$%$ like you have swallowed the bull that Obama wants to take money from the rich and give it to the poor, what he wants to do is level the playing field so everyone gets a fair chance instead of the rich getting to write all the rules.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358863272480</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 09:01:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358863289001-14</Id><Title>SILVER 3X - USLV EASY 100% OF PROFITS IN FEW WEEKS !!!!!!</Title><Msg>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</Msg><Username>radardeldinero</Username><Timestamp>1358863289001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 09:01:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358863982405-15</Id><Title>what the smarter rich are saying</Title><Msg>Inequality risks destabilizing "global society", Klaus Schwab, the German economist who founded and chairs the World Economic Forum, told CNBC on Tuesday.

Lone Star College System issued an alert on its website Tuesday telling students and faculty on its Houston-area campus in north Harris County to take immediate shelter or avoid the campus. College spokesman Jed Young said it had received reports of a shooter. Aerial footage from local television stations showed police cars and ambulances parked on the campus, emergency personnel attending to people on stretchers and at least person being put into an ambulance. Other people could be seen running from a building led by officers. The Harris County Sheriff's Office had no immediate details.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358882738744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 14:25:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358882855627-69</Id><Topic><Title>Texas gun nuts out playing with their guns, GUNS ARE FUN!!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358882738744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 14:25:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>course a Texas community college is about the same level as a New England elementary school.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358882855627</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 14:27:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358882942693-70</Id><Topic><Title>Texas gun nuts out playing with their guns, GUNS ARE FUN!!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358882738744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 14:25:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>course a Texas community college is about the same level as a New England elementary school.

Mixx Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Buzzflash Reddit Delicious Newstrust Technocrati Share: More . . . A A | Email Us | Print | Forward Article 0 inShare inShare0 Public support for legalized abortion is at an all-time high, despite a move by a growing number of states to put more restrictions on it. Tuesday marks the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the first time that a majority of Americans, seven out of 10, oppose overturning the landmark Supreme Court decision, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. The poll of 1,000 adults conducted last week also found 54 percent think abortion should be legal. At the same time, however, more states have acted to make abortion more difficult for a woman to end a pregnancy. Louisiana, for example, has banned the procedure after 20 weeks. Other state measures range from requiring abortion providers to have hospital admitting privileges to mandatory waiting periods and parent notification for minors. The shift in society's attitude has been the most notable in the last decade, the NBC/Journal poll indicates. The number of people who supported the Roe decision hovered around 60 percent until 2002, when it rose to 65 percent. Another jump came between 2005 and 2013. Now, 70 percent of Americans do not want to see the 1973 landmark decision overturned by the Supreme Court. Leading the change, the poll shows, are African Americans, Latinos and women without college degrees. “These are profound changes,” said GOP pollster Bill McInturff, who conducted the poll along with Democratic pollster Peter Hart. McInturff attributed the growing support in part to the emotionally charged comments on rape and abortion made by Republican Senate candidates Todd Akin of Missouri and Indiana's Richard Mourdock. Both lost their races. “The dialogue we have had in the last year has contributed … to inform and shift attitudes,” he said. All of the state action is taking place as the rate of abortions is dropping. The latest available data from the Centers for Disease Control Data show a decline in both the total number and rate of reported abortions and the ratio of abortions to live births. In 2009, the government recorded 784,507 legal induced abortions. The rate was 15.1 abortions per 1,000 women and the ratio was 227 abortions per 1,000 live births. From 2000, the number, rate, and ratio of reported abortions decreased 6 percent, 7 percent, and 8 percent, respectively. Since the 2011 legislative sessions, however, states have put 135 restrictions in place, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a think tank on sexual and reproductive health. Last year, 19 states put 43 restrictions in place — the second highest number since 1985, the institute's website said. Virginia passed a measure that requires a woman to have an ultrasound before she can get an abortion and Mississippi decided doctors at its sole abortion clinic must have hospital admitting privileges. So far, the clinic has not complied with the new law and could be shut down, which would make the state the first where a woman could not get an abortion. "The laws that have been passed, in the last couple of years especially, really make women walk through a gauntlet to get abortions, throughout the country," Planned Parenthood spokesman Eric Ferrero told NBC News. Federal law prohibits taxpayer dollars from paying for abortions except in rare circumstances, but anti-abortion activists point out that government funding of Planned Parenthood for other reproductive health services, such as gynecological exams, frees up the non-profit's private monies for abortions. "A majority of Americans do not want their tax dollars being used to fund abortions," Mallory Quigley, a spokeswoman for the Susan B. Anthony List, told NBC. An effort is underway by the Susan B. Anthony List to get the federal government to cut public support to the women's health group and nine states — Arizona, Indiana, Kansas, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin ­— have already slashed their Planned Parenthood budgets. Planned Parenthood is fighting back, both in the courts and through lobbying. "What we've seen over the last two years is the public doesn’t want these preventive health services to be defunded and the courts won’t allow it," Ferrero said.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358884588305</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 14:56:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358884671079-80</Id><Topic><Title>Oblamo couldn't care less about average Americans...</Title><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1358884330785</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 14:52:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Juniorboy, I can see you respond to my messages but FYI, you and your other dozen IDs are completely on iggy.

Nominee No. 2: [Kalamazoo Gazette]: James Burns, 34, (a mechanic) of Alamo, MI, was killed in March as he was trying to repair what police describe as a "farm-type truck." Burns got a friend to drive the truck on a highway while Burns hung underneath so that he could ascertain the source of a troubling noise. Burns' clothes caught on the drive shaft, however, and when the other man stopped he found Burns "wrapped in the drive shaft." Nominee No. 3: [Hickory Daily Record]: Ken Charles Barger, 47, accidentally shot himself to death in December in Newton, NC. Awakening to the sound of a ringing telephone beside his bed, he reached for the phone but grabbed instead a Smith &amp; Wesson 38 Special, which discharged when he put it to his ear. Nominee No. 4: [UPI, Toronto]: Police said a lawyer demonstrating the safety of windows in a downtown Toronto skyscraper crashed through a pane with his shoulder and plunged 24 floors to his death. A police spokesman said Garry Hoy, 39, fell into the courtyard of the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower early Friday evening as he was explaining the strength of the buildings windows to visiting law students. Hoy previously had conducted his demonstrations of window strength according to police reports. Peter Lawson, managing partner of the firm Holden Day Wilson, told the Toronto Sun newspaper that Hoy was "one of the best and brightest" members of the 200-man association. A person has to wonder what the dimmer members of this law firm are like. Nominee No. 5: [The News of the Weird]: Michael Anderson Godwin made News of the Weird posthumously. He had spent several years awaiting South Carolina’s electric chair on a murder conviction before having his sentence reduced to life in prison. While sitting on a metal toilet in his cell attempting to fix his small TV set, he bit into an electrical wire and was electrocuted. Nominee No. 6: [The Indianapolis Star]: A cigarette lighter may have triggered a fatal explosion in Dunkirk, IN. A Jay County man, using a cigarette lighter to check the barrel of a muzzleloader, was killed Monday night when the weapon discharged in his face, sheriff's investigators said. Gregory David Pryor, 19, died in his parents' rural Dunkirk home at about 11:30 PM. Investigators said Pryor was cleaning a 54-caliber muzzle-loader that had not been firing properly. He was using the lighter to look into the barrel when the gunpowder ignited. Nominee No. 7: [Reuters, Mississauga, Ontario]: A man cleaning a bird feeder on the balcony of his condominium apartment in this Toronto suburb slipped and fell 23 stories to his death. "Stefan Macko, 55, was standing on a wheelchair when the accident occurred," said Inspector Darcy Honer of the Peel Regional Police. "It appears that the chair moved, and he went over the balcony," Honer said.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358886403206</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 15:26:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358886587807-87</Id><Title>The Swearing in of Ophony...</Title><Msg>...

Two relationships (one with his wife and one with “muse” Pele Massa, who was 17 when they started dating) were ended due to Ted’s infidelity while on the road, often with underage women. But Ted justifies his behavior with one of his trademark funny expressions: “alternative flesh management.” Courtney Love phoned into the Howard Stern Show on Monday before eventually coming into the studio where she made the shocking allegation that one of the first times she had oral sex was with Ted Nugent. She said she was young and she didn’t want to say exactly how old she was, but eventually confessed she was 12-year-old — which would have made Nugent approximately 28 years old at the time. The New York Post attempted to contact Nugent for a response but was unsuccessful. Moderators at Nugent’s official forum deleted the only thread asking about the topic as evidenced by the forum’s search giving a file not found error for the matched thread. She added it was a long time ago and she didn’t even have breasts yet. OK. So that's just two sources that say that Ted Nugent not only had sex with underaged girls, but bragged about it, and one of those girls was a 12-year old Courtney Love. In the slideshow section, we have a screencap from the October 2000 edition of Spin Magazine that tells how "Bring 'Em Young" Nugent talked a girl's parents into making him her legal guardian... but that's just another source, isn't it.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358893341706</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 17:22:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358893611599-116</Id><Title>Ted Texas hero, family values guy, LOL</Title><Msg>Ted the Family Guy He has had two wives and has eight children, including three out of wedlock in two liaisons almost 30 years apart.

In 2005 Nugent was involved in a legal battle for not paying enough child support. In 1978, Nugent began a relationship with seventeen-year-old Hawaii native Pele Massa.

Leah Gayle Shipman, 42, married Johnnie Ray Ison two years after she was arrested for having sex with him aged just 15 at Wilmington High School in North Carolina. That means the authorities can't make Ison, who is now 19, give evidence against Shipman, The Wilmington Star-News reports. This is because under North Carolina law a defendant's spouse cannot be made to testify in criminal cases. Brunswick County Assistant District Attorney Gina Essey reportedly said: 'None of the statements made in this case would be admissible without the victim. The defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against them.' Simpson was facing 15 years for statutory rape at the time of the wedding, which came just six days after she divorced her husband of 19 years. Ison's mother gave permission for son, who was still a minor, to marry. The wedding only became public knowledge after Shipman pleaded guilty last month to resisting an officer investigating alleged abuse. She was given a 30-day suspended jail sentence. She was fired by the school.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358895289948</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 17:54:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358896424288-120</Id><Topic><Title>NO REASON FOR PERSONAL ATTACKS ON OBIMBO!!!!</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1358882184167</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 14:16:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Delusional people like to think there's a God.
