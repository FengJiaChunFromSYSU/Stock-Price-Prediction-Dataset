Faced with the prospect of a second term by a president they had endlessly condemned as an enemy of the state (and much, much worse), the right-wing media embraced pure campaign denial and announced that doomsday awaited Obama on Nov. 6: Dick Morris: "Prediction: Romney 325, Obama 213" Glenn Beck: "321-217 victory for Romney in the electoral college." Rush Limbaugh: "Everything -- Except the Polls -- Points to a Romney Landslide" Michael Barone: "Romney Beats Obama, Handily" George Will: Romney 321, Obama 217 Newsmax: "Expect a Mitt Romney Landslide" Larry Kudlow: "I am now predicting a 330 vote electoral landslide." It didn't work out that way. And again, this wasn't simply a case of partisans rooting for their side and letting that enthusiasm color their analysis. What was so unusual was that there was no polling data to support the idea of a Romney landslide. None. Zero. It did not exist. Instead, this was a school of conservative pundits incapable of imaging the president being reelected and incapable of imaging Obama not losing in a humiliating electoral rout. As Taylor Marsh notes today: From Dick Morris pontificating about a "landslide" to Sean Hannity#$%$ squad, the hatred for the President has dripped day after day, crafting a narrative that a Romney win was in hand. No evidence, just malarkey. But in one misguided sense, who could blame them? Anyone who regularly watched Fox News, listened to AM talk radio or read the hot-house conservative media for the last four years must have been convinced that Obama's 2008 victory was a massive mistake and that it was only a matter of time before voters corrected their blunder. That's been the wayward message for nearly 48 months: America was anxious to right the Obama wrong and, when given the opportunity on Nov. 6, there would be a Republican stampede. Turns out viewing politics through the filter of hate severely limits your vision.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1352366893617</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 04:28:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352367092846-4</Id><Topic><Title>Republicans out spent Barrack Obama 40 to 1 and Romney still Lost</Title><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1352343854606</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 22:04:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U proved: $$$$ can't buy everthing.</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1352367092846</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 04:31:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352367933795-5</Id><Title>WHY THE SOUTH HATES OBAMA, THE INBREEDS CAN'T COMPETE IN THE MODERN WORLD</Title><Msg>They thought cleaning guns, stuffing animals, digging ditches and betting on college football was a way of making a good living.

Many investors bought and sold over the past few months under the belief that Romney stood a better chance of striking a bargain with a Democratic Senate than President Barack Obama does with a Republican House to avoid the looming fiscal cliff. Click to Play Red states, blue states and stocksHow did stock-market returns for companies in swing states affect the elections? Harris Private Bank’s Jack Ablin has answers. (Photo: Getty Images) They hoped the former Massachusetts governor would win, but he didn’t. Unlike the climate in Washington, the stock selloff that has kicked off is going to be bipartisan. That’s because the only thing worse for investors than uncertainty (or misplaced hope) is the near certainty that the U.S. economy is about to be hit by government-spending cuts, tax increases or some combination of both. I’ve heard old traders say that gridlock in Washington can be good for business, and thus good for stocks. But that assumes the executive and legislative branches are capable of at least keeping the wheels from falling off the U.S. economy. If the president and Congress could just do that — and not mess with too much else, the thinking goes — companies will invest in their markets. When done right, those investments lead to profits and jobs, both of which are good for the economy and the stock market. After the election results Tuesday night, however, U.S. stock investors have serious doubts about whether the country’s divided government can keep the wheels on economic growth. Tough choices The fact that everything from coal stocks to health-care stocks fell on Wednesday should tell investors that the downward market move is going to be broad, as well as sharp. That in turn will hurt profits in the tech industry, because corporate customers with less money to spend will be bad news for the likes of Cisco Systems Inc. /quotes/zigman/20039/quotes/nls/csco CSCO -1.54% , EMC Corp. /quotes/zigman/225273/quotes/nls/emc EMC -3.12% , Microsoft Corp. /quotes/zigman/20493/quotes/nls/msft MSFT -2.61% and Oracle Corp. /quotes/zigman/76584/quotes/nls/orcl ORCL -2.66% The Dow Jones Coal Index fell 9% the day after the election, in case anyone hadn’t noticed that the industry is no friend of this president, who is forcing it to either clean up or shut down old power plants. That’s good for the environment and for natural-gas companies, which provide an alternative source of relatively low-cost energy for current power markets. Click to Play What does election mean for stocks?Lawrence McDonald, author of "A Colossal Failure of Common Sense," discusses how Wall Street is likely to view a second Obama term. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images) But while pushing investment toward renewable energy and away from coal will be good in the long run — because fossil fuels will run out before the wind and sun — it’s bad for the utility costs paid by businesses in America right now. Those are the kind of tough, long-term choices faced by this country. Those are also the kinds of policies that will depress profits across the economy. That’s bad for the stock market in the near term. The health-care sector had risen sharply this year, before Wednesday, because the industry already was getting plans in place to implement the Affordable Care Act, which is going to be a boon for its business. Or was that rally a “buy-on-the-hope” bet, a hedge that Romney would be elected and help repeal the law?</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1352379755461</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 08:02:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352380083237-16</Id><Topic><Title>small business no longer hiring</Title><Username>mngtscrwdup</Username><Timestamp>1352330618577</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 18:23:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pn, The missing piece and the fallacy of your argument is that the US can indefinitely PRINT MONEY, Greece cannot.

Nearly all of Illinois except Chicago and East St. Louis is Red. Obama won the popular vote by about 2 million votes and got 900,000 of the plurality in Chicago. By leveraging blind lemming voting by blacks (93% for Obama) and Hispanics (71%) who liked Obama's illegal alien program to steal American jobs and citizenship, and blaming Bush for Obama's own failings, Obama won re-election. Unfortunately, Obama has no plan for his second term. 4 more years of misery. There is no reason to expect anything different than the last 4 years. Europe will be in recession for next 2 years. America is already in recession. Obama can blame Sandy and the Republicans for the recession. He's a complete #$%$-er. Romney's 52 point plan was exactly what America needed to restore the economy.

The company told employees about the changes on Wednesday, in a memo obtained by Reuters and confirmed by Boeing. Boeing, the Pentagon's second-largest supplier, said the changes were the latest step in an affordability drive that has already reduced the company's costs by $2.2 billion since 2010, according to the memo. The measures come as U.S. weapons makers are under pressure to cut costs and preserve profit margins amid dwindling defense spending in the U.S. In a message to employees, Dennis Muilenburg, chief executive of Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security, said the company aimed to cut costs by an additional $1.6 billion from 2013 through 2015. "We are raising the bar higher because our market challenges and opportunities require it, and our customers' needs demand it," Muilenburg said. He said the total savings would reach $4 billion, making the company healthier and better able to deal with a tougher marketplace. He said Boeing would cut the number of executive jobs an additional 10 percent by the end of 2012, bringing overall cuts in its executive team to 30 percent for the past two years, a move that would result in a 10 percent cut in management costs. Boeing said the changes were not a response to the threat of additional, across-the-board U.S. budget cuts due to take effect on Jan. 2, or the outcome of U.S. elections, but represented another step in its continuing drive to "be more competitive while investing in technologies and people." Boeing said it could not project exactly how workers would lose their jobs because it would try to place people in its growing commercial business.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352405708531</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:15:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352405890993-100</Id><Topic><Title>Let the Layoffs begin: OFFICIAL LAYOFF THREAD</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352405610331</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:13:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree.

Click the audio tab below to hear even more from this compelling conversation: “I’ve done my share of educating my employees. I never tell them which way to vote. I believe in the free system we have, I believe in the right to choose who they want to be president, but I did explain as a business owner that I have always put my employees first. I always made sure that when I went without a paycheck that [I] made sure they were paid. And I explained that I always put them first and unfortunately I’m at a point where I’m being forced to have to worry about me and my family now and a business that I built from just me to 114 employees. “I explained to them a month ago that if Obama gets in office that the regulations for Obamacare are gonna hurt our business, and I’m gonna have to make provisions to make sure I have enough money to cover the payroll taxes, the additional health care I’m gonna have to do, and I explained that to them and I said you do what you feel like in your heart you need to do, but I’m just letting you know as a warning this is things I have to think of as a business owner.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352405897697</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:18:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352407632240-102</Id><Title>REPUKES FEELING LIKE DEMS in 2004.

Covidien, a N.Y.-based surgical supplies manufacturer, recently announced layoffs of 200 American workers and plans to move some of its plant work to Mexico and Costa Rica, in part because of the coming tax hit. Mass.-based Zoll Medical Corp., which makes defibrillators and employs some 1,800 workers in the U.S. and around the world, says the medical device tax will cost the company between $5 million and $10 million a year. This July, Indiana’s Cook Medical Inc. shelved plans to open five new plants because of the imminent medical device tax hit. They are not alone. The heads of Koch Industries, Westgate Resorts and ASG Software Solutions have all separately informed their employees of prosperity-undermining Obama economic politics. Left-wing groups have lambasted the executives for exercising their political free speech. But they have remained silent while the White House corruptocrats bribed federal defense contractors into delaying federally mandated layoff disclosures before the election. In a memo now being investigated on Capitol Hill, Obama promised to cover the legal fees of Lockheed Martin and other defense contractors if they ignored legal requirements to inform workers in advance about so-called sequestration cuts to the military’s budget scheduled to kick in next year. Robert E. Murray, founder and CEO of Murray Energy Corporation in Ohio, blasted the White House anti-coal agenda for the layoffs and closure of his company’s mine. He told Obama water-carrying CNN anchor Soledad O’Brien that “the many regulations that (Obama) and his radical appointees and the U.S. EPA have put on the use of coal, there are dozens of them and collectively by his own energy administration, have closed 175 power plants.” As O’Brien barked at her guest about purported environmental objections, Murray explained that “we cannot get permits for these mines. They are delaying the issuance of permits. If you can’t get the permit, you can’t have the mine. … I created those jobs, and I put the investment in that mine. And when it came time to lay the people off, I went up personally and talked to every one of them myself to lay them off. It’s a human issue.”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352408741643</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 16:05:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352408923569-109</Id><Topic><Title>wetbrains will always stay wet</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1352405168322</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:06:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump.I noticed you trailing me too,Junior .Leave me alone .Not interested in your silliness.</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1352408923569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 16:08:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352409216773-110</Id><Title>More Obama transparency.</Title><Msg>Iran fired on one of our drones over international waters on Nov. 1st.

Also on the day after the election, the CEO of the Papa John’s pizza restaurant chain, John Schnatter, told a small community college audience in Florida that ObamaCare would likely result in cuts to employee hours by franchise owners seeking to escape the law’s mandates by eliminating full-time positions, a move he described as “common sense” and “lose-lose.” Schnatter also predicted ObamaCare would add between $5 million and $8 million to his business costs (which is fine, because he’s an evil rich guy who supported Mitt Romney for president, and we all know that truly patriotic job creators happily pay for increased business costs out of their own pockets) and that it would add 10 to 14 cents to the cost of his pizzas, which is a bummer, but under Obamanomics theory is totally unrelated to the process of extracting that “fair share” from idle plutocrats. Then he headed off to help out with a telethon for Hurricane Sandy victims and write the Red Cross a million-dollar check, but we all know that private charity is irrelevant, as only Big Government can save us from big storms. The Huffington Post relays the thoughts of Fox Business Network corresponded Charlie Gasparino, who says Wall Street executives are “in mourning” after Obama’s re-election, because “they know that Wall Street is going to lay off a lot more people.” About 10,000 of them by the end of the year, in fact, if the New York state comptroller’s estimate is accurate. It’s not a big deal though, because those people are evil. Everyone knows that investment capital and consumer loans should be redistributed by selfless government agencies, not greedy bankers. According to Gasparino, things could look up if “Republicans and Democrats happen to reach a long-term budget deal similar to Simpson-Bowles,” which could mean “the market is going to go through the roof” to “Dow 20,000, easy.” But he knows perfectly well that’s not going to happen. We’ll more likely get the usual: big tax increases right now, combined with vague promises of largely symbolic spending cuts at some indeterminate point in the future. Once the sequestration cuts and financial industry devastation are done, the real action to watch in the job market next year will be the transition of full-time workers to part-time. That’s a very attractive option for escaping from ObamaCare and reducing payroll costs, without producing headline-grabbing mass layoffs (executives don’t like giving the impression their companies are terminally ill) or depriving operations of needed labor altogether. As a New York Times article noted in October, it’s increasingly easy for service companies (which accounted for the bulk of job creation in the last pre-election employment report) to do, using “sophisticated software that tracks the flow of customers, allowing managers to assign just enough employees to handle the anticipated demand.” It’s a trend that’s been developing for a long time, but there are now powerful incentives accelerating it. The result “has been a bane to many workers, pushing many into poverty and forcing some onto food stamps and Medicaid. And with work schedules that change week to week, workers can find it hard to arrange child care, attend college or hold a second job.” Fortunately, there are lots of food stamps to give away here in the New Normal, and it’s likely that pleas for more extensive government-provided child care to assist America’s part-time workforce would not fall upon deaf ears. Update: An anonymous business owner in Las Vegas told talk-radio host Kevin Wall he fired 22 of his 114 employees on the day after President Obama’s re-election because “elections have consequences” and “at the end of the day, I need to survive.” He said this was necessary to “make sure I have enough money to cover the payroll taxes and the additional health care I’m gonna have to do.” “Well unfortunately, and most of my employees are Hispanic — I’m not gonna go into what kind of company I have, but I have mostly Hispanic employees — well unfortunately we know what happened and I can’t wait around anymore, I have to be proactive,” the businessman continued. ”I had to lay off 22 people today to make sure that my business is gonna thrive and I’m gonna be around for years to come. I have to build up that nest egg now for the taxes and regulations that are coming my way. Elections do have consequences, but so do choices. A choice you make every day has consequences and you know what, I’ve always put my employees first, but unfortunately today I have to put me and my family first, and you watch what’s gonna happen. I’m just one guy with 114 employees — well was 114 employees — watch what happens in the next six months. The Dow alone lost 314 points today. There’s a tsunami coming and if you didn’t think this election had consequences, just wait.” The entire conversation can be heard by clicking this link. Update: FreedomWorks has an extensive list of even more post-election layoffs resulting directly from Obama policies. Among the bigger names: Welch-Allyn, Dana Holding Corporation, Stryker, Boston Scientific, and Medtronic. The confirmed post-election jobs death toll from this list stands at 5,263 jobs, but much more are on the way, including a 5 percent cut in the huge Stryker workforce, a probably comparable reduction of Dana’s even larger staff, and talk of jobs being sent to China. The transition to part-time labor I mentioned above is also discussed.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352413736655</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 17:28:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352414996715-126</Id><Title>You can't beat Santa Claus , Obama bribed the 49% with presents</Title><Msg>Romney was right about nobody caring about tax cuts when they don't pay taxes.

Consider how General Motors decided to take around 3,000 IT experts from Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), increasing its internal information technology efficiency. This transferring of employees is said to be a "cost-neutral solution" for GM to handle IT centers. General Motors is planning to decrease its internal Information Technology dependency on outsourcing which currently meets more than 90 percent of its IT needs. General Motors, the largest U.S automaker, has a joint venture with Hewlett-Packard and already installed HP's Enterprise Security Suite, Vertica and Autonomy Software, IT performance Suite and Detroit-based automakers in its technology centers. All in all, GM will take up to 10,000 IT experts from HP in two new innovation centers located in Austin, Texas and Warren, Michigan.

Dr. Rick D. Schoeling, a primary care physician in Pittsburg, Kansas, tells PJM that if he were in the position of considering medical school today, he would choose to avoid medicine entirely: Oh no, no way. Nine out of 10 physicians right now recommended that their family not become physicians. It used to be families would all be in medicine; not anymore. Schoeling, who graduated in 1986 from the well-regarded University of Kansas School of Medicine, said the effects of Obamacare, if it were to be fully implemented, would be far-reaching and detrimental: We will lose a lot of the patient/physician relationship, in that instead of me recommending to the patient what kind of screening test or things like that, it’ll be much more of a cookbook kind of thing. That fundamentally isn’t the expensive thing, but that’s been the thing that most physicians treasure, most patients treasure — that ability to have that open communication and that control over your patients’ health care. Many critics of the legislation say millions of people will move from private insurance — already expensive for doctors to manage — into the Medicare and Medicaid systems. It’s a move which will put a strain on doctors, who already struggle to break even on the Medicare and Medicaid patients they have. Schoeling said he expects a rise in Medicare and Medicaid patients if Obamacare is fully implemented, and while he currently continues to see the Medicare and Medicaid patients he has, he’s not accepting new ones: If we’re (lucky Medicaid is) 20 to 30 cents on the dollar from what we get from insurance rates. Obamacare cuts $716 billion from Medicare. The way that’s implemented is it will be a 27.1 percent cut in reimbursement in Medicare and Medicaid patients to private physicians and hospitals. Medicare is about 35 percent of my total practice and it affects internists even more because it’s almost 70 percent of their total practice.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1352415728939</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 18:02:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352415843455-130</Id><Topic><Title>Special Dividend ?</Title><Username>grantuphill</Username><Timestamp>1352396037994</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 12:33:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This company needs to preserver cash?

Just how low will they let the sell side take this thing? We all know Chambers REFUSES to comment and THEY know this so they have no short covering rally fears which makes them BOLD and unafraid to short with abandon. For the year we are NOW DOWN 3% while the Nasdaq is UP 11% for the year. The 3% dividend yield is nice but meaningless when the stock itself never goes up or instead FALLS. I don't know how the bigger houses who have millions of shares continue to let Chambers get a free pass on managing shareholder value. Cisco is a powerhouse and SHOULD at least mirror the indexes, WHY isn't it? Why isn't Chambers protecting shareholder value? If you are going to MISS, then WARN us up front. One could easily say " just sell ", but thats a copout and doesn't change mismanagement. People need to stand up and DEMAND change from the board and shareholders. Chambers needs to go, shareholders will NEVER see any appreciation while this man rapes this company personally and through the Option ponzi scheme they have been playing for a decade. IT'S TIME FOR SOME SHAREHOLDER VALUE.. FYI, I voted ALL my shares AGAINST John Chambers.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1352419363807</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 19:02:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352419430523-144</Id><Title>Return of Lonesome Boy</Title><Msg>Junior back!!!
