Don't be fooled into thinking a 0% tax rate is any less dangerous. Under Paul Ryan's proposed tax plan, any American with enough money to live off of his or her investments will have the option to pay no income tax. That's because dividends, interest and capital gains would not be taxed. Estate taxes would also be eliminated, allowing wealthy families to avoid the income tax in perpetuity. This may sound like "living the dream," but the vast majority of Americans won't be fortunate enough to participate, even if they're keeping their nose to the grindstone. Meanwhile, Ryan's plan increases the national debt for roughly the next three decades, according to a "rosy" analysis. Students of history may recall that an increasing national debt combined with a regressive tax system are two of the catalysts that spurred the French Revolution -- a period of terrible violence that unwound centuries of social order in a matter of years. Forget the 99%, It's the 9% Who Matter Let's imagine that Paul Ryan's tax plan was in place in 2010. Mitt Romney would have paid $177,650 in tax on $21,661,344 in income, according to The Atlantic, while possessing a $200,000,000 nest egg (This amounts to a 0.82% tax rate resulting from Romney's author and speaking fees.) Now imagine a first-year heart surgeon with no assets, saddled with $600,000 in medical school debt. The doctor would also pay $177,650 in tax, but on $710,600 in income -- the same amount in taxes even though the doctor made 96% less than Romney (and has a negative net worth). Roger Arnold once explained the 1-9-90 concept as follows, "revolution never comes from the bottom up or the top down. Revolution comes from the 9% becoming disillusioned with the top 1% and identifying more closely with the bottom 90%." With whom do you suppose this imaginary doctor would identify? Is it not a scary concept that an educated, hard-working surgeon may feel economically punished by his or her ambition?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347807471765</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 10:57:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347810812550-13</Id><Topic><Title>SANTORUM TELLS AUDIENCE "WE ARE IDIOTS" #$%$ !!!!</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1347771810210</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 01:03:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There is not one smart person in this room, you are all dummies, that is why you have come to see me"</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1347810812550</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 11:53:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347810966454-14</Id><Topic><Title>"We will never have the media on our side, ever, in this country.

NEW YORK (AP) — Occupy Wall Street began to disintegrate in rapid fashion last winter, when the weekly meetings in New York City devolved into a spectacle of fistfights and vicious arguments. Punches were thrown and objects were hurled at moderators' heads. Protesters accused each other of being patriarchal and racist and domineering. Nobody could agree on anything and nobody was in charge. The moderators went on strike and refused to show up, followed in quick succession by the people who kept meeting minutes. And then the meetings stopped altogether.</Msg><Username>sentry85nm</Username><Timestamp>1347819145218</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:12:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347819397531-28</Id><Topic><Title>"We will never have the media on our side, ever, in this country.

The State of Israel's treatment of the Palestinians has been compared by United Nations investigators, human rights groups and critics of Israeli policy to South Africa's treatment of non-whites during its apartheid era. Israel has also been accused of committing the crime of apartheid.[1][2][3] Critics of Israeli policy say that "a system of control" in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, including Jewish-only settlements, separate roads, military checkpoints, discriminatory marriage law, the West Bank barrier, use of Palestinians as cheap labour, Palestinian West Bank enclaves, inequities in infrastructure, legal rights, and access to land and resources between Palestinians and Israeli residents in the Israeli-occupied territories resembles some aspects of the South African apartheid regime, and that elements of Israel's occupation constitute forms of colonialism and of apartheid, which are contrary to international law.[4] Some commentators extend the analogy, or accusation, to include Arab citizens of Israel, describing their citizenship status as second-class.[12]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347821306675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:48:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347821784488-32</Id><Topic><Title>Israel apartheid</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347821306675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:48:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Market to open in a little over 18 hours,Magoo .Are you going to buy another $2,000,000 of AAPL like you did Friday.????

Such examples include the slaughter of the Jews by the Nazi’s, the massacre of the Armenians by the Turks, and the slaughter by the Russians and Chinese of many of their own people. Other examples of ethnic cleansing have been carried out in the Balkans and Central Africa. In Rwanda, for example, the Hutus mass murdered 80,000 Tutsis and Tutsi sympathizers in 100 days. The Western world became acutely aware of divinely sanctioned genocide, or Jihad, following the tragic events of September 11, 2001. While the existence of genocide in our world is disturbing enough, it is even more unsettling to find it taught in the Bible. In the Old Testament, God commanded the annihilation of the Canaanites (Deut 7:1-2). Biblical genocide has proven to be a source of embarrassment for various theologians and commentators. Regarding the decree of God to destroy the children, Calvin acknowledged, “...the decree is dreadful indeed, I confess...”2 Wink similarly complains, “Against such an image of God the revolt of atheism is an act of pure religion. By contrast, the God whom Jesus reveals refrains from all forms of reprisal and demands no victims. God does not endorse holy wars or just wars or religions of violence”3</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347834817139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 18:33:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347836927643-44</Id><Topic><Title>Joow's invented genocide</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1347834817139</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 18:33:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are 1.2 million Arab citizens of the State of Israel, they have the right to vote, the right to assemble, the right of free religion, free speech, they can hold public office, they have political parties and representation in the 120 seat Israeli Parliament.
