Some of Greene’s associates have purportedly called his views “extreme.” Police made the discoveries and subsequent arrests when they went to the couple’s home over the weekend to look for Gliedman who is wanted for purported credit-card theft. The Post has more about the bizarre alleged findings: A detective discovered a plastic container with seven grams of a white chemical powder called HMTD, which is so powerful, cops evacuated several nearby buildings. Police also found a flare launcher, which is a commercial replica of a grenade launcher; a modified 12 gauge Mossberg 500 shotgun; ammo; and nine high-capacity rifle magazines, the sources said. Cops also allegedly uncovered papers about creating homemade booby traps, improvised submachine guns, and various handwritten notebooks containing chemical formulas. According to the Associated Press, Gliedman is awaiting her court appearance; Greene was held without bail after a court appearance on Sunday. Both were charged with criminal possession of a weapon."

They did not just vote to raise income taxes. They voted to raise the payroll tax on all Americans. This will hurt small businesses. Ironically, this plan generates less revenue than even John Boehner's Plan B option. But both options, as I have long maintained, were only about breaking the will of the GOP and getting the GOP to violate its tax pledge. Well, today the White House is telling Fox New's Ed Henry that this was the game all along. According to Ed Henry, the White House staff is saying that getting the GOP to break their tax pledge is, "One of the most consequential policy achievements of the last couple of decades." The plan cuts $1.00 in spending for every $41.00 in tax increases. Contrary to what Senator Pat Toomey is claiming today, everyone's taxes will also go up - the 99% and the 1%. That will be the headline if the House Republicans vote for this plan. Marco Rubio and Rand Paul were defiant. They know what is at stake. Now, many of you think this is the best deal we can get. I understand that. But consider this — the White House has designed this solely for purposes of getting the GOP to break their tax pledge. Any way we play the game we lose. The only way to even think of winning is to not play this game. House Republicans should reject this deal, go over the cliff, and then from any vantage point they will not be voting to raise taxes. They can shift the argument from tax increases and decreases to tax reform. They should go over the cliff.".......</Msg><Username>bullbear308</Username><Timestamp>1357058984285</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 11:49:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357060989596-30</Id><Topic><Title>$620B in tax hikes and $15B in Spending cuts</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1357053916339</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 10:25:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Never before in the history of human endeavors have so many blustered so long to accomplish so little.

If the limit is not raised by late February or early March, the U.S. would default on its debt. This is just the beginning of the end.

Global growth in advanced economies is too weak to bring down unemployment and what little momentum exists is coming primarily from central banks, the International Monetary Fund said in its World Economic Outlook. "A key issue is whether the global economy is just hitting another bout of turbulence in what was always expected to be a slow and bumpy recovery or whether the current slowdown has a more lasting component," it said. "The answer depends on whether European and U.S. policymakers deal proactively with their major short-term economic challenges."

Well they hold a lot of it on their balance sheets and in order to balance their assets against their rising liabilities one way to achieve this is to allow the price of gold to go up. So inflate away the debts of the world by allowing the price of gold to increase? It is not as mad as it sounds. If you want to reset the global financial system this is one method of achieving it: tie the currencies of the world more closely to gold. It worked before for several hundred years. The central banks of China, Russia and Europe are leading this fight against American currency debasement. It is not so outlandish at all. The Chinese have a stated policy of doubling their gold reserves over the next three years and have supported the IMF’s plan for Special Drawing Rights including gold as a new global currency. Perhaps we should approach this from another direction. How likely is it that the US dollar will continue to remain the reserve currency of global trade with the Fed now committed to QE to infinity and a much lower US dollar? If the present foreign holders of the greenback sign up to this future scenario then they are going to pay off US debts through dollar devaluation. Do they want to do this? Most probably not and that is why so many central banks are again net buyers of gold whereas they were net sellers a few years back. Gold and US debt For gold bugs this is something of an ideal scenario. Both the global central banks down to the small investor are planning for a dollar collapse as the mounting debts over power the once almighty US financial system. By doing so they make it more likely and drive up the price of gold in the process. However, if this thesis is proven correct then the new price of gold will not be a transient one but a permanent feature of the financial system. There is not enough gold, and even less silver to go around and many predict that $5-10,000 an ounce for gold and $200-500 silver will be reached if the precious metals are to take on this role again. It’s a price the world will have to pay for sound money and an end to the financial instability of recent years, not that we have seen the end of that just yet.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1357071992397</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 15:26:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357072097350-88</Id><Topic><Title>2013 the year the whole country goes GUN FREE, imagine a</Title><Username>cdmovado</Username><Timestamp>1357068737628</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 14:32:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you totally deranged?

Sometimes the initial buyer would cooperate with ATF, and agents would arrest the actual buyer when he showed up to take possession of the guns. If the guns went to a stash house, agents would speak with subjects at the stash house or conduct a search of the stash house. This agent told us that ATF interdicted guns as a matter of course and had been “content to make the little cases,” but that Wide Receiver represented a “different direction” from ATF’s typical practice." --Report by the Office of the Inspector General on the Review of ATF's Operation Fast and Furious and Related Matters September 2012[24] ATF "gunwalking" operations were, in part, a response to longstanding criticism of the bureau for focusing on relatively minor gun violations while failing to target high-level gun smuggling figures.[25] U.S. firearms laws currently govern the possession and transfer of firearms and provide penalties for the violation of such laws. “Gun trafficking”, although not defined by statute, essentially includes the movement or diversion of firearms from legal to illegal markets.[26]:Summary A 2009 GAO report on efforts to combat arms trafficking to Mexico notes that straw purchasing is not in itself illegal, although it is illegal to provide false information in connection with a purchase.[27]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357075513538</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 16:25:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357075586660-103</Id><Title>New Senate bill means higher taxes for 77% of Americans</Title><Msg>Congrats on NOT raising taxes on the middle class like you promised, O'Liar.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1357075586660</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 16:26:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357075823434-104</Id><Title>Cantor does not support Senate Bill</Title><Msg>Looks like O'losers " out of the park " political victory is on the ropes.

But for those others following what is going on The elimination of the Bush Tax cuts caused a dramatic increase in taxes, so if we compare the current plan to not passing any tax cuts at all, yes it would increase the deficit by 4 trillion over the next 10 years (assuming tax cuts don't result in increased growth). If you compare this plan to the laws that were in place yesterday this plan cuts the deficit by 650 to 725b (according to the CBO). Frankly I don't have a problem going over the cliff, I don't mind paying more in taxes. Let's go back to the tax rates that existed under Clinton. If the GOP doesn't support Obama's massive Tax Cuts that's fine. The best part is the GOP get's blamed for voting down tax cuts and Obama can focus on gun control and further nationalizing healthcare.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357082435841</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 18:20:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357082550416-137</Id><Topic><Title>Oh boy, Dumb Dumb tongue tied now</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1357081420525</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 18:03:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is funny is the tea baggers were all for Bush's tax cuts but now that they are going to be Obama's tax cuts they are against them.

Join me in dealing with these criminals, and I'll help you with the spending issue immediately after that.</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1357085604117</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 19:13:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357085669352-159</Id><Topic><Title>Emancipation Proclamation 150 days old today</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357085161614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 19:06:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ad hominem is an admission you have no argument.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357085669352</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 19:14:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357085872744-160</Id><Title>GOP amendment is to cut 300 billion from Medicare</Title><Msg>tea baggers say kep ur damn goberment hans off my medicare, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357085872744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 19:17:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357086237659-161</Id><Topic><Title>Remember two days ago when John Boehner said</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357076939254</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 16:48:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ is a coward.</Msg><Username>superdupershortysporty</Username><Timestamp>1357086237659</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 19:23:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357086451392-162</Id><Topic><Title>Emancipation Proclamation 150 days old today</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357085161614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 19:06:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumb Dumb, it's 150 YEARS old not days.

Mr. Obama found himself under withering criticism from some in his liberal base who accused him of caving in to Republicans by not taxing the rich more. Just as Speaker John A. Boehner has been under pressure from his right, Mr. Obama faces a virtual Tea Party of the left that sees his compromise as capitulation.

The investigation began in November when one of his patients complained to police after Escobar allegedly threatened him for nonpayment of a bill. Escobar had cleaned the man’s teeth, injected him with an anesthetic and examined him for extraction of a tooth, the Ventura County Sheriff’s Department said in a news release."

The judgment, among the largest ever awarded in a district molestation case, comes at a time when L.A. Unified faces close to 200 pending molestation and lewd conduct claims arising from another teacher's alleged conduct at Miramonte Elementary School. Tuesday's jury award stems from acts committed by Forrest Stobbe, a veteran teacher at Queen Anne Place Elementary School in the Mid-Wilshire area. In September 2011, Stobbe pleaded no contest to two counts of a lewd act on a child and to continuous sexual abuse of a child younger than 14. He is currently serving a 16-year sentence in prison. The case turned on how much responsibility the school system bore, and whether district employees should have recognized warning signs that Stobbe posed a threat to the boy. Attorneys for the school system insisted that district staff acted in a professional and appropriate manner and could not have known what Stobbe was doing."

Today marks the first day of the week-long celebration of African-American history and culture through the seven principles of Kwanzaa: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. To many, Kwanzaa serves as a time of reflection–taking lessons learned from our past and looking forward to a more promising tomorrow. It reminds us that though there is much to be thankful for we must recommit ourselves to building a country where all Americans have the opportunity to achieve their dreams. As families across America light the Kinara today in the spirit of unity, our family extends our prayers and well wishes during this season. Kwanzaa recognizes seven principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity, and faith. Kwanzaa was first celebrated in 1966 and is observed by an estimated 2 million Americans. *** Kwanzaa is a made up holiday for non-Christian savages. This message is at least three times as long as Obama's Christmas message.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1357094352258</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 21:39:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357094503971-199</Id><Topic><Title>Dumb Ivan went to a church on the 24th.</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1356929658084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-30 23:54:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The word "savage" means wild, untamed, or barbaric, and as a result is often associated with viciousness or cruelty.
