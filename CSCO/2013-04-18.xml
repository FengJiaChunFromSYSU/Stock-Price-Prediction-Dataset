CORINTH, Miss. (AP) — A Mississippi man was arrested Wednesday, accused of sending letters to President Barack Obama and a senator that tested positive for poisonous ricin and set the nation's capital on edge a day after the Boston Marathon bombings. Paul Kevin Curtis, 45, was arrested at 5:15 p.m. at his apartment in Corinth, near the Tennessee state line about 100 miles east of Memphis, said FBI Special Agent in Charge Daniel McMullen. It wasn't immediately known where he was being held.</Msg><Username>philrimms</Username><Timestamp>1366286798568</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 08:06:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366288593119-10</Id><Topic><Title>rightwing red state nutcase sends 'ricin' letter signed: "I am KC and I approve this message."</Title><Username>philrimms</Username><Timestamp>1366286798568</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 08:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tea partiers /NRA members are very dangerous to this society !</Msg><Username>philrimms</Username><Timestamp>1366288593119</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 08:36:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366289642723-11</Id><Topic><Title>rightwing red state nutcase sends 'ricin' letter signed: "I am KC and I approve this message."</Title><Username>philrimms</Username><Timestamp>1366286798568</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 08:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>condoning these vicious RICIN terrorist acts? reported!</Msg><Username>philvimms</Username><Timestamp>1366289642723</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 08:54:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366291741352-12</Id><Title>AWWW, LAMEDUCK OBAMA LOSES GUN BATTLE IN CONGRESS</Title><Msg>AWWWWWWWW..but then again, he IS a lamelamelame duck!</Msg><Username>lameduck0bama</Username><Timestamp>1366291741352</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:29:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366292008628-13</Id><Topic><Title>AWWW, LAMEDUCK OBAMA LOSES GUN BATTLE IN CONGRESS</Title><Username>lameduck0bama</Username><Timestamp>1366291741352</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:29:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gun control is moving ahead and gaining momentum.

Let's start with the lax zoning requirements, which allowed such a high-risk enterprise smack dab in the middle of a residential neighborhood. And the Chemical Safety Board, which was deployed to the West TX site last night, is chronically understaffed and inadequate because... you guessed it, it's underfunded by a Big Oil-friendly Congress! They get $10.5 million to regulate an industry with 170 major companies making 70,000 different chemicals, totaling $750 billion revenue. Thanks, Congress! Then there's OSHA, which is supposed to protect workers in the workplace but is really more of a fig leaf. Do you know how many OSHA inspectors we have for the entire country -- more accurately, how many we don't? Six fertilizer plants were inspected by OSHA in the past five years. West Fertilizer was not one of them. (When West Texas was cited for OSHA violations in 1985, their fine was $30.) Experts say for a country the size of the United States, we should have 12,000 OSHA inspectors. We have 2,220. And the fines are laughable. So remember: This tragedy was completely preventable. We just didn't bother. Because Grover Norquist fights to keep that money out of government agencies and in the pockets of the 1%.

Just because a bad thing happened to you doesn’t mean that you get to put a king in charge of my life. I’m sorry that you suffered a tragedy, but you know what? Deal with it, and don’t force me to lose my liberty, which is a greater tragedy than your loss. I’m sick and tired of seeing these victims trotted o ut, given rides on Air Force One, hauled into the Senate well, and everyone is just afraid — they’re terrified of these victims.” “I would stand in front of them and tell them, ‘g o to hell,’” he added.</Msg><Username>philsinns</Username><Timestamp>1366299751127</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:42:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366300729148-41</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Radio host: Families of Newtown shooting victims can ‘go to hell’</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1366298546823</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:22:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Davis should be fired for saying something that stupid and insensitive.

Almost.</Title><Msg>Bill O’Reilly makes my case that conservatives are bullies, dishonest and crybabies. We almost get the hat trick in this episode with liberals who refuse to roll over and play dead in the face of O’Reilly’s misrepresentation and mis-characterization. O’Reilly is particularly odious to me. He is just a year or so younger than me, which means he was eligible for the draft. In addition, he is a Navy brat, which means he understood the obligation better than, say, Rush Limbaugh, who grew up as a Country Club Republican and never entertained military service, ever. O’Reilly went to college to become a teacher. Teaching was a draft refuge during the 60’s: if you were a teacher, you were exempt from the draft. O’Reilly graduated and went into teaching the year the draft ended. He quit teaching the following year. He makes a big deal about his dad saying the war was wrong and that he, the son, was acting out of conscious. That’s #$%$. Like most of the boys at the time, he was scared shiftless of going to Vietnam and he would have had a gender change if it kept him out of the Army. It’s like Newt Gingrich marrying a proxy for his mother so that he wouldn’t have to serve with his father. It is just total #$%$. In addition, it is pretty clear to me from the content and method of his analysis that he was eyeball deep in the anti-war movement, the SDS or some fellow traveler sort of enterprise. His deployment of the dialectic is right out of the Ann Arbor play book.

L. Lin Wood was the lead attorney in all of Jewell's libel cases.[1][2][9][10] In 2006, Jewell said the lawsuits were not about money, and that the vast majority of the settlements went to lawyers or taxes. He said the lawsuits were about clearing his name.[2] [edit]Richard Jewell v. Piedmont College Jewell filed suit against his former employer Piedmont College, Piedmont College President Raymond Cleere and college spokesman Scott Rawles.[9] Jewell's attorneys contended that Cleere called the FBI and spoke to the Atlanta newspapers, providing them with false information on Jewell and his employment there as a security guard. Jewell's lawsuit accused Cleere of describing Jewell as a "badge-wearing zealot" who "would write epic police reports for minor infractions."[1] Piedmont College settled for an undisclosed amount.[11] [edit]Richard Jewell v. NBC Jewell sued NBC News for this statement, made by Tom Brokaw: "The speculation is that the FBI is close to making the case. They probably have enough to arrest him right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always want to have enough to convict him as well. There are still some holes in this case".[12] Even though NBC stood by its story, the network agreed to pay Jewell $500,000.[9] [edit]Richard Jewell v. New York Post On July 23, 1997, Jewell sued The New York Post for $15 million in damages and settled with the newspaper for an undisclosed amount.[13]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366331187451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 20:26:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366331733174-133</Id><Topic><Title>pretty funny the racist Murdock papers</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366328972263</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 19:49:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't remember you using "too" properly but I remember you using this "I thing I has a constriction all right</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366331733174</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 20:35:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366331744615-134</Id><Topic><Title>pretty funny the racist Murdock papers</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366328972263</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 19:49:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Exactly.

(AP) — A teenager said he is scared to go outside after he was portrayed on the Internet and on the front page of the New York Post as connected to the Boston Marathon bombings. Photos of Salah Eddin Barhoum, 17, and friend Yassine Zaime were posted on websites whose users have been scouring marathon finish line photos for suspects. The two were also on the Post's front Thursday with the headline: "Bag men: Feds seek these two pictured at Boston Marathon." The Post reported later Thursday that the men weren't considered suspects, and the FBI has since identified two other men as suspects in the bombings Monday that killed three and injured more than 180. MORE : FBI releases photos of bombing suspects FULL COVERAGE : Boston Marathon bombings But Barhoum, a track runner at Revere High School, said he is convinced some will blame him for the bombings, no matter what. He was so fearful on Thursday that he ran back to the high school after a track meet when he saw a man in a car staring at him, talking into a phone, he said. Barhoum added he received more than 200 messages online Wednesday, with one commenter from Oregon asking: "How could you do that?
