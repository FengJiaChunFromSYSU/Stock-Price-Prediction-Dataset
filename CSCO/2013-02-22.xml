Washington, DC -- The upside of the government's sequester initiative is a $1.2 trillion reduction in the deficit. The downside is that the blunt force action will produce many unanticipated cuts and changes that will adversely affect every American. A recently released report from the Congressional Budget Office provided these examples: Open season will be declared on all wildlife in national parks. Good thing you didn't turn in those 25 shot assault rifle clips. Tuesdays will be eliminated. And if you complain, they'll take away your Saturdays too. The Daytona 500 will become the Daytona 315.2. Race fans will have to chug their Budweisers 36.2% faster. The Vietnam War will be reignited. The General Accounting Office has determined that we have to go back in to retrieve 12,376 assault rifles that were left behind. There seems to be a shortage of them in the states. It would be nice if we could locate John McCain's false teeth as well. He took them out to renounce "those American capitalist pigs" and hasn't had a decent steak since. The price of gold will be linked to New York State's "Pick Four" daily lottery number. The financial system seems ready for another insane gamble. Place your bets. The Navy SEALs will be traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins. This could get interesting when the arena organist tries to play "O Canada!" The U.S. Postal Service will take back all the mail it has delivered for the past three months. That's everything except your bills. Asked to explain why so many quirky provisions were added to the sequester decree, a spokesman for the Congressional Budget Office noted that Republicans in Congress "havn't been sleeping well lately."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1361532198294</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 06:23:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361532981579-2</Id><Title>More problems for the losers</Title><Msg>Polls: Most Americans Side With Obama On Major Issues February 21st, 2013 1:13 pm Henry Decker According to two new polls, President Barack Obama has the upper hand on his Republican opponents on literally every major piece of his second-term agenda. A USA Today/Pew Research poll released Thursday finds that a vast majority of Americans side with President Obama over House Republicans on almost everything the president mentioned in his State of the Union address. On the current budget battle, 76 percent agree with the president that Congress should reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, while just 19 percent agree with the Republican position that tax increases should be completely off the table. If no deficit deal is reached by March 1st, when the first sequestration cuts kick in, 49 percent would blame House Republicans, compared to just 31 percent who would blame President Obama. Americans are behind President Obama’s proposal to raise the minimum wage to $9.00 an hour by an overwhelming 71 to 26 percent margin; even 50 percent of Republicans agree with the plan. On gun control, 53 percent support banning high-capacity magazines, 56 percent want to ban assault weapons, and 83 percent would like to see a stricter background check system. The White House favors all three of these proposals, while Republican leadership has opposed them. On climate change, Americans like the idea of addressing the nation’s energy supply by developing alternative energy sources over increasing production of oil, coal, and natural gas by a 54 to 34 percent margin. Additionally, 62 percent approve of setting stricter emission limits on power plants to address climate change, while just 28 percent oppose the idea. Finally, on immigration, 47 percent agree with the president’s position that better border security and a path to citizenship should be the priority of a new policy, while just 25 percent would like to see an enforcement-only approach. Overall, the poll finds that Obama has the upper hand over House Republicans on each key issue: This finding is confirmed by a new Bloomberg national poll, which finds that “Americans by 49 percent to 44 percent believe Obama’s proposals for government spending on infrastructure, education and alternative energy are more likely to create jobs than Republican calls to cut spending and taxes to build business confidence and spur employment.” On a personal level, President Obama has an even more dominant upper hand over his Republican opponents. The poll finds the president’s approval rating at 55 percent — his highest level of support since September 2009. By contrast, only 35 percent have a favorable view of the Republican Party — a three-year low. Taken together, the polls repudiate the Republican Party’s favored response to the drubbing it received in November. Clearly, the problem here isn’t just the GOP’s messengers — voters also reject the message itself.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1361532981579</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 06:36:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361533238378-3</Id><Title>How would Juan Wayne react to this?</Title><Msg>CHUCK GRASSLEY AFRAID OF NATIVE AMERICAN COURTS - Chuck Grassley, who is already the closest thing Congress has to a crotchety 1860s homesteader, does not trust America's indigenous population. Jen Bendery: "Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) didn't vote for the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization bill when it passed the Senate last week. And on Wednesday, he gave a blunt reason why: he doesn't think tribal courts are capable of giving a fair trial to non-Native Americans. Grassley was holding a town hall meeting in Indianola, Iowa, when a constituent asked him about his VAWA vote. Think Progress reported on the meeting and posted a video of Grassley's response, during which he argued that, since reservations are made up of Native Americans, those jurists wouldn't be fair to a non-Native American. 'If you have a jury, the jury is supposed to be a reflection of society,' Grassley said. 'Under the laws of our land, you've got to have a jury that is a reflection of society as a whole, and on an Indian reservation, it’s going to be made up of Indians, right? So the non-Indian doesn't get a fair trial.'"</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1361533238378</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 06:40:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361533583326-4</Id><Title>CSCO may very well end up being the ticker to observe this quarter.</Title><Msg>If you are searching for details on the subject of the stock market, then you ought to take a look at this.....**xcellonline[dot]biz/-CSCO*</Msg><Username>kwanjose385</Username><Timestamp>1361533583326</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 06:46:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361535232395-5</Id><Title>Sovereign Citizen - REPUB makes terrorist threats against Pelosi, Reid, Shumer</Title><Msg>YOU REPUBS are the party of sickness, disease, hatred, and NOW DOMESTIC TERRORISM!</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1361535232395</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 07:13:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361537032065-6</Id><Title>Obama 4 year record below that liberals voted for.

Eight government scientists were recently fired or reassigned after voicing concerns to their superiors about faulty environmental science used for policy decisions. Which begs the question, "Are some government agencies manipulating science to advance political agendas?" The Department of Interior has been hijacked by a culture of environmentalism. They are engaged in an aggressive crusade to obstruct and undermine the use of natural resources, restrict human access to public lands, and increase its influence over private property. Decisions made by the agency are presumed to be based on sound scientific analysis, but often times policy is driving the science, rather than science driving environmental policy. This has led to harmful decisions and a violation of the public trust. So who told us more lies the past 4 years Obama or Lance Armstrong? Need anyone say more?</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1361537505878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 07:51:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361537664002-9</Id><Title>Obama Gas over $5 bucks in La!

The devil tells them it is for calling back to Earth. Putin asks to call Russia and talks for 5 minutes. When he is finished the devil informs him that the cost is a million dollars, so Putin writes him a check. Next Queen Elizabeth calls England and talks for 30 minutes. When she is finished the devil informs her that the cost is 6 million dollars, so she writes him a check. Finally George Bush gets his turn and talks for 4 hours. When he is finished the devil informs him that the call is free. When Putin hears this he goes ballistic and asks the devil why Bush got to call the USA so cheaply. The devil smiles and replies, "Since Obama took over, the country has gone to hell, so it's a local call."</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1361539155218</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:19:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361539273686-38</Id><Title>Hillary Clinton admit you failed and where incompetent not fit to be in government.</Title><Msg>Hillary Clinton admit you failed and where incompetent.

I think we all agree with the President: America is not a deadbeat nation. We are a nation that has long prided our sense of innovation and entrepreneurship. The vast majority of us lives within our means and pay our bills on time. We pay our taxes on time. We should expect that our government, funded by our tax dollars, would do the same. However, yesterday it was announced the White House will once again miss the legal deadline for sending a budget to Congress. In a letter to House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the White House said it would send the president’s budget “as soon as possible.” Did Obama mention that this is the fourth time the Administration has missed the deadline? In fact, since assuming office in January 2009, the President has delivered only one budget on time. What would happen to your family if you missed the deadline for filing your taxes four out of the last five years? What would happen to your business if you missed filing a financial disclosure form for the Securities and Exchange Commission? Time to do your job Mr. Obama be a leader not a blamer and excuse maker.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1361539789547</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:29:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361539805722-47</Id><Topic><Title>ANYONE CAN BEAT OBAMA - drstone3</Title><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1361538053000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:00:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.........DING!</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1361539805722</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:30:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361539875931-48</Id><Title>ML King was Pro-Life not like Obama who supports Baby Killing Abortion like most democrats.

I hope you enjoy the reading it is all true.</Title><Msg>Joe Biden Every Friday the vice president takes a helicopter designated as Marine Two from the vice president’s residence in northwest Washington to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. He then hops on Air Force Two to fly back to his home in Delaware. At the end of the weekend, he returns on Air Force Two, usually a Boeing C-32. On Saturdays in warm weather, Biden regularly returns to Andrews on the airplane to play golf at the base with President Obama. After the game, he flies back to Delaware. On Sunday evening, he returns on the plane to Washington — all at taxpayer expense. The Boeing C-32 is a specially configured Boeing 757-200 commercial jet. The cost of flying the plane is $22,000 an hour, so each half-hour trip to or from Delaware costs about $10,000. Each golf game costs taxpayers $20,000. At that rate, the annual cost to taxpayers of Biden’s weekend trips is well over $1 million. That does not include so-called deadhead flights when the plane often flies back to Washington empty and then returns empty to pick up Biden. In addition, the Secret Service rents more than 20 condominiums in the Wilmington area for agents who must accompany Biden when he returns to his home state. Rather than try to find hotel space, the Secret Service decided to rent the condos in part because, even when he knows his schedule in advance, Biden rarely tells agents until the last minute when he will be returning to Wilmington beyond his weekend trips. As a result, agents cannot plan their own lives. A Secret Service agent says that since Air Force Two parks at Andrews, Obama is obviously aware that Biden is running up a huge government tab for each game of golf they play. Biden’s press office had no comment. Asked if President Obama thinks these costs are appropriate and why he has not questioned Biden’s flying to play golf with him at a cost of $20,000 per game, the president’s press office had no comment. Biden’s commutes have cost taxpayers at least $4 million so far. After my story ran on Newsmax, a major media outlet obtained Pentagon records confirming the trips and costs. But so far, that outlet has not run the story. The rest of the media have ignored it. In addition to his salary as vice president of $230,700, Biden has free use of the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory. The vice president’s residence is a handsome 9,150-square-foot, three-story mansion overlooking Massachusetts Avenue NW in Washington. Complete with pool, pool house, and indoor gym, the white brick house was built in 1893 as the home of the superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory. Congress turned it into the official residence of the vice president in 1974 and gave it the address One Observatory Circle. During the day, at least five Navy stewards attend to every personal need of the second family, including cleaning, cooking, shopping for food, and doing the laundry. Biden has portrayed himself as a regular Joe, a product of a working-class family who takes on millionaires and Republicans who are said to be out of touch with middle-class Americans. Last June, Obama appointed Biden to root out wasteful government spending. But behind the scenes, it’s a different matter. Biden’s disregard for the cost of constantly shuttling back and forth to his home in Wilmington and his additional trips to golf with the president betray the arrogant, contemptuous attitude we saw him display toward Ryan during the debate. “The White House is a character crucible,” Bertram S. Brown, M.D., a psychiatrist who formerly headed the National Institute of Mental Health, told me for the Secret Service book. “It either creates or distorts character. Few decent people want to subject themselves to the kind of grueling abuse candidates take when they run in the first place,” says Dr. Brown. “Even if an individual is balanced, once someone becomes president, how does one solve the conundrum of staying real and somewhat humble when one is surrounded by the most powerful office in the land, and from becoming overwhelmed by an, at times, pathological environment that treats you every day as an emperor?” The vice president has chosen the emperor approach, revealing his true character.</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1361540601022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:43:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361540703940-58</Id><Topic><Title>ANYONE CAN BEAT OBAMA - drstone3</Title><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1361538053000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:00:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>....DINGALING drstone3</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1361540703940</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:45:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361540717419-59</Id><Title>Very sick Obama please get help for your Narcissistic personality disorder.

Narcissistic personality disorder is a condition in which people have an inflated sense of self-importance and an extreme preoccupation with themselves. Causes, incidence, and risk factors The causes of this disorder are unknown. An overly sensitive personality and parenting problems may affect the development of this disorder. Symptoms A person with narcissistic personality disorder may: • React to criticism with rage, shame, or humiliation • Take advantage of other people to achieve his or her own goals • Have excessive feelings of self-importance • Exaggerate achievements and talents • Be preoccupied with fantasies of success, power, beauty, intelligence, or ideal love • Have unreasonable expectations of favorable treatment • Need constant attention and admiration • Disregard the feelings of others, and have little ability to feel empathy • Have obsessive self-interest • Pursue mainly selfish goals Signs and tests Like other personality disorders, narcissistic personality disorder is diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation and the history and severity of the symptoms. Treatment Psychotherapy (for example, talk therapy) may help the affected person relate to other people in a more positive and compassionate way. Expectations (prognosis) The outcome depends on the severity of the disorder. Complications • Alcohol or other drug dependence • Relationship, work, and family problems</Msg><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1361540717419</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:45:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361540762320-60</Id><Title>The OBAMA’S 2013 State of Union speech in one sentence.

To be watching all of this, to be treated, to have my intelligence, all of us, to have our common sense and intelligence insulted the way it's being, it just makes me ashamed. Seriously man, here we get worked up over $44 billion dollars, that’s the total amount of money that will not be spent that was scheduled to be spent this year. And in truth, we’re going to spend more this year than we spent last year. The thrice-divorced, draft-dodging, drug-addicted college dropout was born in 1951. So he's lived through the Kennedy assassination, the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing along with the rest of the violent death of Jim Crow, the assassinations of MLK and Robert Kennedy, the Vietnam War, My Lai, Cambodia, Watergate, Iran-Contra, Columbine, the Iraq War, Abu Ghraib, Katrina, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook -- just to name a few -- and none of that made him ashamed of his country. But a manufactured budget crisis, engineered by the GOP -- now that's a national disgrace.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1361547776015</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 10:42:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361547792335-105</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see this report yet?

Obama administration economist; CNBC and MSNBC contributor 'Obama's Sequester?' Pure Nonsense Posted: 02/21/2013 5:04 pm Democrats Sequester , Obama's Sequester , Republicans Sequester , Sequester , Sequester Cuts , Sequestration , Politics News For my sanity and yours, I rarely get into the silliest corners of politics, but this conservative talking point that the word "sequester" must actually be called "Obama's sequester," like they had nothing to do with it, is really beyond the pale. I get that both sides are trying to position themselves to not get blamed for this totally preventable, self-inflicted wound, but here are some facts that belie this ridiculous Republican disowning of a policy they supported. -- The sequester was part of the Budget Control Act, passed in 2011 with bipartisan support. In fact, a larger share of House Republicans voted for the bill than Democrats: 174 (73 percent) voted for it and 66 against, while Democrats were split 95-95. In the Senate, 28 Republicans voted for it and 19 against, while Democrats supported it 45-6. -- Voting in support of the bill that contained the sequester were Reps. Boehner, Ryan, Cantor and Sen. McConnell. -- Speaker Boehner said of the bill including the sequester: "I got 98 percent of what I wanted." Given their highly amped up disdain of the sequester now, I find it hard to believe that this was the 2 percent he didn't want. -- On the day of the vote, Rep. Paul Ryan explained the spending cuts in the bill to Sean Hannity, adding the following: "And if they breach that amount across the board, sequester comes in to cut that spending, and you can't turn that off without a supermajority vote. We got that in law. That is here..." -- Then there's the Powerpoint slide that the Daily Beast put up yesterday from Speaker Boehner in July of 2011 advertising the sequester as a selling point to his fellow Republicans: "[The bill] sets up a new sequestration process to cut spending across-the-board..." So, should we be calling this "Ryan's sequester?"..."Boehner's sequester?" No. We -- they -- should stop acting like truculent kids on the playground, get to work, and defuse their latest fiscal time bomb.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1361549312162</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:08:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361549343509-112</Id><Topic><Title>MoMENTum on CSCO</Title><Username>whitleyr23</Username><Timestamp>1361285684753</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 09:54:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Checking it out right now.</Msg><Username>nicole.forgey59</Username><Timestamp>1361549343509</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:09:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361549741539-113</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO Upgraded to STRONG BUY (EXCLUSIVE REPORT)</Title><Username>jake.lees</Username><Timestamp>1361366193772</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:16:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I got it</Msg><Username>charlessizer</Username><Timestamp>1361549741539</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:15:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361549975156-114</Id><Topic><Title>Obama + Reid + Pelosi = 3 stooges in Washington!</Title><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1361539613533</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 08:26:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From the words of Nancy Pepperoni, .we need to pass the health care bill to find out What is in it, a true MORON</Msg><Username>joespada282</Username><Timestamp>1361549975156</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:19:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361550132919-115</Id><Topic><Title>boehners' sequester</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1361549508950</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:11:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bogus notion: being able to cut $1 for spending for each $1 that the deficit ceiling is raised!</Msg><Username>pugsley_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1361550132919</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:22:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361550286541-116</Id><Title>yahoo new home page sucks</Title><Msg>yahoo new home page sucks</Msg><Username>hamrinms</Username><Timestamp>1361550286541</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:24:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361550455801-117</Id><Topic><Title>boehners' sequester</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1361549508950</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 11:11:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>l'ts time to pay for the Bush (the inferior) years.

Fifty-five percent of Americans approve of Obama’s performance in office, his strongest level of support since September 2009, according to a Bloomberg National poll conducted Feb. 15-18.

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg 12:18 Feb. 19 (Bloomberg) -- President Barack Obama speaks about the need for Congress to avert the automatic $1.2 trillion in budget cuts set to kick in March 1. Obama said if lawmakers can’t agree on a broad deal to replace the across-the-board spending reductions, Congress should “at minimum” pass a temporary, smaller package that provides more time for negotiations. (Source: Bloomberg) Chart: Poll Results Attachment: Poll Results Americans by 49 percent to 44 percent believe Obama’s proposals for government spending on infrastructure, education and alternative energy are more likely to create jobs than Republican calls to cut spending and taxes to build business confidence and spur employment. “The Republicans are not offering any new solutions,” said poll respondent Cynthia Synos, 62, a political independent who lives in the St. Louis suburb of Greendale, Missouri. “Their answer is always tax cuts and incentives for business. I’ve never heard them say anything innovative to spark the economy that would help the other 85, 90 percent of people that have to deal with the economy as it is.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1361555793319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 12:56:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361556232263-140</Id><Topic><Title>CSCO may very well end up being the ticker to observe this quarter.</Title><Username>kwanjose385</Username><Timestamp>1361533583326</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 06:46:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yea they are legit</Msg><Username>dennisortiz82</Username><Timestamp>1361556232263</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:03:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361556275899-141</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals spend all day on message board</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1361555017169</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 12:43:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Expending nervous energy as they see Bammy's popularity eroding away before their eyes.</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1361556275899</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:04:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361556389782-142</Id><Title>Obozo's Reign of Error, 1353 Days Remain...</Title><Msg>... and counting</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1361556389782</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:06:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361556447716-143</Id><Topic><Title>Did you see this report yet?

First that isn't at all what the Court ruled. In New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services v. A.L., the court overturned a lower court’s finding that a newborn was abused or neglected based primarily on tests of a stool sample shortly after birth, which was positive for cocaine metabolites. The court’s interpretation of the applicable statute wisely forces the state child protective agency to build a stronger case that a newborn is at risk of future harm before making a finding of abuse and neglect, which might justify temporary or permanent removal of the child and even termination of parental rights. Second it puts the NJ Supreme Court right in line with those liberal courts in Kentucky and South Carolina, so while it might satisfy your need to be outraged it turns out to be good public policy. Concern about prenatal drug exposure has driven states in three different directions. A majority of states have prosecuted at least some women for using illegal drugs while pregnant. Charges have included homicide (when the pregnancy ends in late miscarriage or stillbirth), criminal child endangerment, and drug delivery to a “minor” (the fetus). When appealed, most of the convictions are overturned, on the grounds that the relevant statutes were not intended to include an unborn child as a potential victim. Only the South Carolina Supreme Court has upheld a homicide conviction in a case of prenatal drug exposure; courts in other states have reversed convictions in similar cases. The Kentucky Supreme Court overturned a criminal child endangerment conviction based in part on a state law discouraging punitive actions against pregnant drug and alcohol abusers. Such tactics, the law stated, would “discourage[e] these individuals from seeking the essential prenatal care and substance abuse treatment necessary to deliver a healthy newborn.” The problem of drug abuse during pregnancy should be treated, according to this law, “solely as a public health issue.” In recent years, some legislatures have passed criminal laws explicitly targeting drug abuse by pregnant women. These laws expressly criminalize the targeted behavior, and are thus not vulnerable to the claim that unborn children were not intended as potential victims. And they are almost certainly constitutional. One effort to crack down on pregnant women’s drug use in South Carolina was invalidated by the Supreme Court. In Ferguson v. City of Charleston (2001), the Court held unconstitutional a state hospital’s policy of drug-testing pregnant women without their consent. When a woman tested positive, the hospital would threaten criminal charges unless she agreed to enter a rehabilitation program. Because patients had a reasonable expectation of privacy in their medical tests, and the central purpose of this testing protocol was to gather evidence used to threaten or pursue criminal prosecution, the Court held that the practice violated the Fourth Amendment.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1361559109959</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:51:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361559354457-161</Id><Topic><Title>LIBERAL NJ Supreme Court allows MOMS to Smoke CRACK right before they deliver their child</Title><Username>dumbpainting</Username><Timestamp>1361557480827</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 13:24:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The court’s interpretation of the applicable statute forces the state child protective agency to build a stronger case that a newborn is at risk of future harm before making a finding of abuse and neglect SO being BORN WITH CRACK in your system ain't enough proof of abuse?

Every cigarette you smoke narrows the blood vessels in the umbilical cord, reducing your baby's oxygen supply. Just one or two cigarettes a day can increase the risk of premature delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight, and other complications. And studies suggest that even light smoking during pregnancy can up your baby's odds for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). So you must agree a woman who smokes during pregnancy should be arrested. Of course she might have been exposed to second hand smoke so anyone who smokes around a pregnant woman should be arrested, of course it's impossible to tell for sure if a woman is pregnant or not so smoking itself must be made illegal.

Jose Illegal: $15.00 per hour x 40 hours = $600.00 per week, or $31,200.0 0 per year. Jose Illegal pays no taxes. Jose Illegal now has $31,200.00. Joe Legal pays medical and dental insurance with limited coverage for his family at $600.00 per month, or $7,200.00 per year. Joe Legal now has $24,031.00. Jose Illegal has full medical and dental coverage through the state and local clinics and emergency hospitals at a cost of $0.00 per year. Jose Illegal still has $31,200.00. Joe Legal makes too much money and is not eligible for food stamps or welfare. Joe Legal pays $500.00 per month for food, or $6,000.00 per year. Joe Legal now has $18,031.00.

Joe Legal pays $200.00 per month, or $2,400.00 for car insurance. Some of that is uninsured motorist insurance. Joe Legal now has $7,231.00. Jose Illegal says, "We don't need no stinkin' insurance!" and still has $31,200.00. Joe Legal has to make his $7,231.00 stretch to pay utilities, gasoline, etc.. Jose Illegal has to make his $31,200.00 stretch to pay utilities, gasoline, and what he sends out of the country every month.. Joe Legal now works overtime on Saturdays or gets a part time job after work. Jose Illegal has nights and weekends off to enjoy with his family. Joe Legal's and Jose Illegal's children both attend the same elementary school. Joe Legal pays for his children's lunches, while Jose Illegal's children get a government sponsored lunch. Jose Illegal's children have an after school ESL program. Joe Legal's children go home. Now, when they reach college age, Joe Legal's kids may not get into a State School and may not qualify for scholarships, grants or other tuition help, even though Joe has been paying for State Schools through his taxes, while Jose Illegal's kids "go to the head of the class" because they are a minority. Joe Legal and Jose Illegal both enjoy the same police and fire services, but Joe paid for them and Jose did not pay. Do you get it, now?

If approved, they would be allowed to legally reside in the U.S., work (and pay taxes) and leave the country for short periods of time. They could then apply for legal permanent residence, commonly known as a green card, within eight years if they learn English and "the history and government of the United States" and pay back taxes. That would then clear the path for them to apply for U.S. citizenship.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1361560587557</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:16:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361560606864-174</Id><Topic><Title>Consensus is Obama is Unqualified, Incompetent, Egomaniac, Marxist, and Fraud &amp; Liar.</Title><Username>drstone3</Username><Timestamp>1361560017155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:06:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that wingnutters consensus?

Both families have two parents, two children, and live in California . Joe Legal works in construction, has a Social Security Number and makes $25.00 per hour with taxes deducted. Jose Illegal also works in construction, has NO Social Security Number, and gets paid $15.00 cash "under the table". Ready? Now pay attention.... Joe Legal: $25.00 per hour x 40 hours = $1000.00 per week, or $52,000.00 per year. Now take 30% away for state and federal tax; Joe Legal now has $31,231.00. Jose Illegal: $15.00 per hour x 40 hours = $600.00 per week, or $31,200.0 0 per year. Jose Illegal pays no taxes. Jose Illegal now has $31,200.00. Joe Legal pays medical and dental insurance with limited coverage for his family at $600.00 per month, or $7,200.00 per year. Joe Legal now has $24,031.00. Jose Illegal has full medical and dental coverage through the state and local clinics and emergency hospitals at a cost of $0.00 per year. Jose Illegal still has $31,200.00. Joe Legal makes too much money and is not eligible for food stamps or welfare. Joe Legal pays $500.00 per month for food, or $6,000.00 per year. Joe Legal now has $18,031.00. Jose Illegal has no documented income and is eligible for food stamps, WIC and welfare. Jose Illegal still has $31,200.00. Joe Legal pays rent of $1,200.00 per month, or $14,400.00 per year. Joe Legal now has 9,631 .00. Jose Illegal receives a $500.00 per month Federal Rent Subsidy. Jose Illegal pays out that $500.00 per month, or $6,000.00 per year. Jose Illegal still has $ 31,200.00. Joe Legal pays $200.00 per month, or $2,400.00 for car insurance. Some of that is uninsured motorist insurance. Joe Legal now has $7,231.00. Jose Illegal says, "We don't need no stinkin' insurance!" and still has $31,200.00. Joe Legal has to make his $7,231.00 stretch to pay utilities, gasoline, etc.. Jose Illegal has to make his $31,200.00 stretch to pay utilities, gasoline, and what he sends out of the country every month.. Joe Legal now works overtime on Saturdays or gets a part time job after work. Jose Illegal has nights and weekends off to enjoy with his family. Joe Legal's and Jose Illegal's children both attend the same elementary school. Joe Legal pays for his children's lunches, while Jose Illegal's children get a government sponsored lunch. Jose Illegal's children have an after school ESL program. Joe Legal's children go home. Now, when they reach college age, Joe Legal's kids may not get into a State School and may not qualify for scholarships, grants or other tuition help, even though Joe has been paying for State Schools through his taxes, while Jose Illegal's kids "go to the head of the class" because they are a minority. Joe Legal and Jose Illegal both enjoy the same police and fire services, but Joe paid for them and Jose did not pay. Do you get it, now? Obama *** Good post. Clearly, we need to exterminate the illegals. What a scam! When they sign up to get legalized, you round 'em up and ship 'em out.

Over the weekend, the WWE introduced a new wrestler/manager character, "Zeb Coulter," who used his time at the mic to commemorate President's Day and attack illegal immigrants. This enranged the Internet, as obvious attempts to enrage the Internet seem to do. Alex Jones lept on it first. Then Glenn Beck, who retains a (surprisingly boring) radio show and a subscription-based video channel, got angry about it. The WWE isn't about to bait Jones, or give him airtime, but Beck's another story. His attack warrants an invitation "to appear live this Monday on Raw," and a patronizing explanation. Similar to other television shows and feature films, WWE is in the entertainment business, creating fictional characters that serve as protagonists or antagonists. To create compelling and relevant content for our audience, it is important to incorporate current events into our storylines. WWE is creating a rivalry centered on a topical subject that has varying points of view. This storyline was developed to build the Mexican American character Del Rio into a hero given WWE’s large Latino base, which represents 20% of our audience.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1361573043067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 17:44:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361573228038-270</Id><Topic><Title>now this is funny, even the WWE is making fun of the tea billies, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1361573043067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 17:44:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OMG this is funny One’s a greasy-haired grappler who calls himself “a real American” and fancies the Gadsden flag. The other is a bushy-bearded hype man who praises the Constitution and blames illegal immigrants for, well, just about everything. Together, Jack Swagger and Zeb Colter are World Wrestling Entertainment’s newest villains — proud heirs to the jerkish, loudmouthed, backstabbing tradition of Nikolai Volkoff, the Iron Sheik and Gulf War-era Iraqi sympathizer Sgt. Slaughter. For Tea Party conservatives, the duo also has become a source of unexpected cultural angst, the equivalent of a metal folding chair to the back of the head. “Did George Soros buy the WWE?” said radio host Glenn Beck during his Wednesday broadcast. “Is this a Cass Sunstein presentation? “I’m sick and tired of being miscast. I am sick and tired of it. It is lazy at best … you’re mocking me for standing up for the Constitution of the United States of America? You’re mocking me for standing up for law and order?” Better question: Has professional wrestling — a popular, bipartisan pastime of oiled pecs, punishing piledrivers and I-can’t-belive-what-I-just-saw! plot twists — turned heel on conservatives? Sure seems like it. Introduced to a national television audience less than two weeks ago, Mr. Swagger and Mr. Colter embody every unpalatable Tea Party stereotype. Xenophobic at best, downright racist at worst, possessing truly terrible facial hair all the while, the two want nothing more in the world than to deport Mexican immigrants.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1361573228038</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 17:47:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361573283289-271</Id><Topic><Title>cscotrader not discussing the merits of CISCO - what a freakin' hypocrite he is!</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1361565940889</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 15:45:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cscotrader, i clearly have to give you a thumbs up on your post. eventhough a newby here, you handily put the filthy pervert magoo and his clones in his place...KUDOS!!!

To begin with, the liberal agenda is, in many respects, the same as it was in the thirties. Whether you call it communism, fascism, socialism, liberalism, or progressivism, the only real difference is how much they believe they can get away with, the way they sell it to people, and the latest trendy name for what they believe. So, once the liberals pick a policy from their stale program to push, the next step is to get it implemented. This is where liberals have problems because whether a policy makes sense, is practical, or actually improves people's lives is of secondary importance to them. What is important to liberals is whether supporting or opposing that policy makes them feel good about themselves. This is why liberals continue to support dysfunctional policies that have been failing miserably for decades and why they often oppose common sense programs that have been proven to work time and time again -- because it isn't about whether it works or not, it's about how it makes them feel. In other words, a liberal will almost always prefer a policy that's extremely expensive, is difficult to implement, helps almost no one, but seems "nice" -- to a policy that is cheap, simple to implement, extremely effective, and seems "mean." However, since most Americans make decisions about policies based on whether or not they believe the policy makes people's lives better or worse, liberals have had to become habitually dishonest about what they believe and want to do to get their ideas put into action. This is a point worth stressing because many people who aren't familiar with politics believe that conservatives and liberals are simply flip sides of the same coin and therefore, approach issues the same way. However, conservatives genuinely believe that this is a center-right country. That's why conservatives have no qualms about being publicly labeled as conservatives and it's part of the reason why we're much more honest than the Left -- because we believe that a majority of the American people generally agree with us and share our values.

Because of this, when liberals don't feel that the political winds are blowing in their direction, not only will they generally avoid discussing the things they believe, they will typically deny that they believe them at all. Additionally, liberals go to bizarre lengths to tilt the political playing field in their favor. They move into the mainstream media so that they can tip what are supposed to be "objective" news stories in their favor. They get into positions of power in our educational system so that they can teach kids liberal propaganda before they're old enough to know better. They uniformly support judges who care nothing about the Constitution as long as it moves liberal ideological goals forward. Even the Left's support of illegal immigration is rooted in the desire to bring in millions of poor people from socialist countries who are more likely to vote Democratic. If they can't convince the American voters they're right, then they'll just bring in some new voters. More disturbing is the Left's ever-increasing reliance on what are commonly thought of as fascist tactics. Liberals at college campuses attempt to disrupt conservative speeches and the Democrats want to try to drive conservative talk radio hosts off the air with the Fairness Doctrine. Conservatives like Tom DeLay, Rush Limbaugh, and Ann Coulter have been targeted criminally for political reasons and there's even talk of trying to jail members of the Bush Administration over policy differences after they're out of office. Ideological soulmates of modern liberals -- like Stalin, Lenin, and Mao -- would certainly approve of those tactics. Still, even though this is a center-right country, we do have political cycles and there are times when those cycles favor the Left. When that happens and the Lefties start to get a bit more confident, usually a few liberals at the edges will start talking about what they want to do. At that early point, most other liberals will still vehemently deny their ideological goals to the public out of fear that it will prevent them from getting into power. However, when the Left gains enough strength to be capable of getting one of the policies they favor implemented, all the liberals who previously denied that they supported it will unapologetically shift on a dime and vote for it en masse -- while they rely on their ideological allies in the media and the fact that many Americans are ill informed about politics to cover their tracks. So, if you want to know what liberals want to do, their words mean absolutely nothing because lying about their agenda has become as natural to them as chasing a cat is to a dog. Instead, what you have to do is watch what other liberals have done when they have come into power. Look at Canada, where conservatives are being put on trial for hate crimes because they've dared to criticize Muslims. Look at European countries, where they have socialistic economies, sky high tax rates, rigid speech codes, and overweening nannystates. You can even look at liberal enclaves in the United States like Berkeley and San Francisco, where members of the military are treated like pariahs and they boo the national anthem. If you believe the liberals in Berkeley, France, Canada or for that matter in the bowels of the Daily Kos or Huffington Post, are significantly different than, say Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton, you are kidding yourself. The only differences are in what they think they can get away with and how honest they are willing to be about their agenda.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1361576902109</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 18:48:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361577858273-279</Id><Topic><Title>Why Liberals Lie About What They Believe</Title><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1361576564467</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 18:42:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama had his press secretary, commentators, online bloggers, LaHood, lib professors, stoopid black on the street all saying the sky is falling because of the sequester.

Now they get a free ride for 99 weeks on Obama. Actually, you're kids will pay for their easy life with 90% taxes. Keynesian economics don't work. They lead to world war. The only reason the U.S. became a superpower creditor nation is because the U.S. produced guns and artillery for the combatants. Now, China and Germany are the creditor nations. The U.S. is a fallen power like Great Britain, Italy, Spain and Japan.
