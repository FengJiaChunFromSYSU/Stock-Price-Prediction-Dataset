'I hope that within the next 24 to 36 hours we can get something we agree on. If not, we're going to move forward on what I think needs to be done,' Reid told reporters. 'The caucus will support me on that,' he added. He specified that he has the 51 votes he needs to proceed on a Democratic plan, indicating he's willing to pursue the 'constitutional option' of changing the rules without the usual two-thirds vote. Previously, a number of senior Democrats had professed reluctance to change the rules with a simple majority, saying they feared it would set a dangerous precedent. Opponents have called the tactic the 'nuclear option.' The sudden deadline puts fresh pressure on the GOP to get on board, and Reid said he and his staff have been negotiating with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) as recently as Tuesday. Earlier, Reid had said the Senate would tackle the rules reform after passing Superstorm Sandy aid."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358944629683</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 07:37:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358945233237-8</Id><Topic><Title>Wow Obama sworn in Using Abraham Lincoln's Bible</Title><Username>lameduck0bama</Username><Timestamp>1358793355649</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 13:35:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure NOT worthy ! only to shine his shoes...</Msg><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1358945233237</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 07:47:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358945821019-9</Id><Topic><Title>The day y'all been waiting on is finally coming</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358944629683</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 07:37:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Didn't do-nothing Mitch filibuster one of his OWN bills in the last session?What a waste he is in Congress,spent the past 4 years making sure Obama was a one term President.Wonder how that worked out for him?Just another teabillie POS in Washington.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358945821019</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 07:57:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358946389829-10</Id><Title>Cisco says Asia Pacific growth is 10 - 12%</Title><Msg>ON Asia Bloomberg yesterday, Cisco's Jaime Valles says Cisco will have 10-12% Revenue growth in the Asia Pacific region.

But the “Party of Stupid”—as Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana has described as his Republican Party—seems unwilling or unable to confront the problem. According to one congressman who attended the GOP’s Williamsburg retreat, the issue of gun control did not even come up at the party conclave. “It might as well have been a trip to Mars,” he said. Except that we are actually exploring Mars right now. In the late 1990s, interestingly, the NRA was a vocal proponent of the gun-free school zones it now decries as big-government liberalism run amok. Here’s what the organization said at the time: “First, we believe in absolutely gun-free, zero-tolerance, totally safe schools. That means no guns in America’s schools, period … with the rare exception of law enforcement officers or trained security personnel.” GUNS ARE FUN!!!

Will He? Posted: 23 Jan 2013 06:00 AM PST Will he really do it? He's threatened to do it so many times before, and then he pulled back at the last minute. Stay tuned, because this will really turn up the heat on the Hill if he does use the constitutional option: In a turnaround, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is threatening Senate Republicans with an obscure (and unprecedented) method of enacting filibuster reform. In a statement to reporters on Tuesday afternoon, the Nevada Democrat said that if he does not secure enough Republican votes within the next 36 hours, he will trigger what is known as the "nuclear option" (alternatively, the "constitutional option"), which would override the established precedent of requiring a supermajority of Senators to change the rules of filibuster, which is the especially annoying tactic used by both sides to delay (and often kill) undesirable legislation. The "nuclear option" requires 51 votes instead of 67, and Reid said Tuesday that he has the votes. This means two things. One, that Reid is making good on his word from November that he would seek, in whatever way possible, to reform the filibuster maneuver.r. And two, that his prior stance on the filibuster is no impediment to him seeking reform now. In several statements collected by BuzzFeed in November, Reid inveighed heavily against the "nuclear option" when it was being considered by Senate Republicans in 2005, calling it "un-American." What changed? As far back as May 2012, Reid signaled that, between then and the middle of President Bush's tenure, the filibuster rule had been significantly "abused" and needed to be reformed: "I have been here in Congress 30 years, but this is a new one. Even bills that [Republicans] agree on, they want to mess around with. In years past, this would have gone through here just like this," Reid said, snapping his fingers. Still, the "nuclear option" is risky: It's never been tried before, and would establish a new precedent for how the Senate majority controls the tactical strategy of the Senate minority</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1358960998644</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:09:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358961038007-75</Id><Title>GOP will be so powerless in America's future that they</Title><Msg>are compelled to dwell on the past,just as long as the past DOESN'T mention the corrupt Bush administration and the atrocities that it committed on the WORLD.</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1358961038007</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:10:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358961461083-76</Id><Title>Tweet of the week on "If only Romney were elected"......</Title><Msg>By now President Romney would've repealed Obamacare, scrapped Obama regs, submitted jobs plan, approved Keystone &amp; stuck it to China #dayone 16h Justin Green‏@JGreenDC @sahilkapur also, made gas about a buck fifty and magically made me lose about 20 pounds 6h Irlandia‏@Irlandia @sahilkapur Uh..Keystone oil is "China &amp; Canada's oil" which will use Keystone Oil pipeline to go through US to be sold on World Mkt 16h Drew Joshua‏@TightButtons @sahilkapur all why doing shots of 2% milk every time the contractor calls with problems regarding the car elevator 16h Ken Keenan‏@kjkeenan1950 @sahilkapur thanks for reminding me of things Romney was going to do on day 1.Brought a great smile to my face. really dodged one with him. 1h James Fidlerten‏@fidlerten @sahilkapur I am sure he would also make us all millionaires overnight and then someone else could do all the dirty work, but...who? 8m Alex Peal‏@nuckles87 @sahilkapur Unless president Romney became King Romney, Obamacare still wouldn't be going anywhere ;).

Included are references to FBI concerns about Middle Eastern temporary residents taking flight courses emphasizing their desire to learn how to fly once the plane is airborne. All are ignored. On the day of the attack G.W. B. freezes for 7 minutes on camera, later that day lies about seeing the first plane hit a tower on his way into the classroom (clip didn't air until 24 hours later), endorses a program that expedites entry into and exit from the U.S, of Saudi Nationals despite the fact that 15 of 19 attackers were Saudi Arabian, the Bush. Administrations allows family members of the leaders of the attackers to leave the U.S. without allowing the FBI to interview them at all. During the Bush years there were 15 acts of terrorism on U.S. soil beginning with the Sept-Oct 2001: Anthrax attacks on Congress, NY govt offices, media and ending with July 27, 2008: Jim Adkisson opens fire with a shotgun at a Unitarian Church service because he "hates left-wing liberals," killing 2 and wounding 7. In between we had Rubin, Krugel, Reid, Hadayet, Muhammad, Malvo. Krar, Bruey, Noster, Taheri-azana, Weathford, Haq, Popal, Shareef, Talovic, Addison, Ackbar And then we have 11 attacks on embassies and consultates beginning with June 14, 2002, U.S. consulate in Karachi, Pakistan Suicide bomber kills 12 and injures 51 and ending with September 17, 2008, U.S. embassy in Sana'a, Yemen Militants dressed as policemen attacked the embassy with RPGs, rifles, grenades and car bombs.

Joseph P. Hoar (Ret.) warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the invasion was risky and perhaps unnecessary. Morton Halperin, a foreign policy expert with the Council on Foreign Relations and Center for American Progress warned that an invasion would increase the terrorist threat.[9] In a 2002 book, Scott Ritter, a Nuclear Weapons Inspector in Iraq from 1991–98, argued against an invasion and expressed doubts about the Bush Administration’s claims that Saddam Hussein had a WMD capability.[10] Brent Scowcroft, who served as National Security Adviser to President George H.W. Bush was an early critic. He wrote an August 15, 2002 editorial in The Wall Street Journal entitled "Don't attack Saddam," arguing that the war would distract from the broader fight against terrorism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which should be the U.S.'s highest priority in the Middle East.[11] The next month, Gen. Hugh Shelton, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, agreed that war in Iraq would distract from the War on Terrorism.[12] Retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, former head of Central Command for U.S. forces in the Middle East and State Department's envoy to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, echoed many of Scowcroft's concerns in an October 2002 speech at the Middle East Institute. In a follow-up interview with Salon, Zinni said he was "not convinced we need to do this now," arguing that deposing Saddam Hussein was only the sixth or seventh top priority in the Middle East, behind the Middle East peace process, reforming Iran, our commitments in Afghanistan, and several others.[13] By January 19, 2003, TIME Magazine reported that "as many as 1 in 3 senior officers questions the wisdom of a preemptive war with Iraq."[14] On February 13, 2003 Ambassador Joseph Wilson, former chargé d'affaires in Baghdad, resigned from the Foreign Service and publicly questioned the need for another war in Iraq.[15] After the War started, he wrote an editorial in the New York Times titled What I Didn't Find in Africa that claimed to discredit a Bush Administration claim that Iraq had attempted to procure uranium from Niger.[16] John Brady Kiesling, another career diplomat with similar reservations, resigned in a public letter in the New York Times on February 27.[17] He was followed on March 10 by John H. Brown, a career diplomat with 22 years of service,[18] and on March 19 by Mary Ann Wright, a diplomat with 15 years of service in the State Department following a military career of 29 years.[19] The war started the next day. Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski (Ret.) was political/military desk officer at the Defense Department’s office for Near East South Asia (NESA) in the months before the war. In December 2003 she began to write an anonymous column that described the disrupting influence of the Office of Special Plans on the analysis that led to the decision to go to war.[20] On June 16, 2004 twenty seven former senior U.S. diplomats and military commanders called Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change issued a statement against the war.[21] The group included: William J. Crowe, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Ronald Reagan Joseph Hoar, former Commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East H. Allen Holmes, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations Donald McHenry, former Ambassador to the United Nations Merrill McPeak, former Air Force Chief of Staff Jack F. Matlock, Jr., a member of the National Security Council under Reagan and former Ambassador to the Soviet Union John Reinhardt, former Director of the United States Information Agency Ronald I. Spiers, Under Secretary General of the United Nations for Political Affairs and a former Ambassador Stansfield Turner, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency Richard Clarke, former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the National Security Council for both the latter part of the Clinton Administration and early part of the George W. Bush Administration, criticized the Iraq war along similar lines in his 2004 book Against All Enemies and during his testimony before the 9/11 Commission. In addition to diverting funds from the fight against al-Qaeda, Clarke argued that the invasion of Iraq would actually bolster the efforts of Osama bin Laden and other Islamic radicals, who had long predicted that the U.S. planned to invade an oil-rich Middle Eastern country.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358967161760</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 13:52:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358967309377-100</Id><Topic><Title>NRA opposes guns on campus, well they did before they sold out to the gun manufacturers</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358953092615</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 09:58:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh my what changed the NRA's mind?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358967309377</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 13:55:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358967463810-101</Id><Title>Fillibuster reform, it'sa commin!</Title><Msg>Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has sent an ultimatum to Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, giving McConnell until Thursday to agree to a watered down filibuster reform package. The idea is that Reid and McConnell would jointly pass a few small-bore reforms with overwhelming bipartisan support. However, if McConnell does not agree to the watered down package of reforms, then Sen. Reid has threatened to pass a much stronger filibuster reform package, and to do so with only 51 Democratic votes. Further, according to the Washington Post, this stronger package would include one of our two primary demands—flipping the burden on filibusters to the minority party: Right now, the majority needs to supply the 60 votes to break a filibuster. The minority only needs one vote on the floor. Under Reid’s backup plan, the burden would be reversed: The minority would have to supply the 41 votes required to keep a filibuster going, while the majority wouldn’t have to do much of anything. That means that if the minority only had 38 votes present in the room, the filibuster would end. It also means the minority could be forced to muster all their people to vote at times of the majority leader’s choosing: say, 3 a.m. on a Saturday. It would make filibustering a much more unpleasant experience.

LOL</Title><Msg>In the days since Obama spoke to the nation about gun violence and put forward proposals to address it, lawmakers in both parties have signaled support for stricter background checks -- mostly Democrats, but some key Republicans, too -- and the White House has made the proposal a top priority. Public support for universal background checks is extremely high, possibly even at 92 percent, per a recent CBS News/New York Times poll. The provision would require anyone selling a firearm to run a background check on the prospective buyer. Under current federal law, background checks are only required for guns sold by licensed firearm dealers, whose sales make up an estimated 60 percent of U.S. gun sales. Private dealers sell the remaining 40 percent without checks -- at gun shows, via the Internet or just between individuals. Some Republicans said they don't support universal background checks because they don't think the government should have any more control over people's access to guns. "Probably not," Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) said when asked if he could support the proposal. "I don't want a national list of people selling guns ... My reasoning is that we have too much government as it is, and frankly, I don't believe it's the guns that are the problem. I think there are many other reasons behind the problem." "I don't know how much tighter they could be," Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) said of background checks, brushing off a question specifically about the gun show loophole. "I'm not getting down in the weeds."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358974169880</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:49:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358974313986-134</Id><Title>MASSIVE DEBT AND ABORTION.....</Title><Msg>so...since the inception of Roe v Wade, 50,000,000 US citizens have been destroyed.

Rand Paul (R-Kentucky). “The only way President Obama can remove that cloud is by resigning from office at once.” While many in the media have blamed Beyoncé for the lip-synching controversy, Mr. Paul said, “We must remember that this happened on President Obama’s watch.” Mr. Paul said that the White House’s refusal to comment on the Beyoncé crisis “only serves the argument that this President has something to hide.” “If Beyoncé lip-synched the national anthem, how do we know President Obama didn’t lip-sync his oath of office?” he said. “If that’s the case, he’s not legally President. But just to be on the safe side, he should resign anyway.” Mr. Paul also blasted Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her testimony on Benghazi before the Senate today: “Her tactic of answering each and every question we asked her didn’t fool anyone.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1358985297129</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 18:54:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358985345031-175</Id><Title>OBAMA KILLS 7 MORE WITH HIS FAVORITE TOY...THE DRONE</Title><Msg>do you think maybe Obama will parachute women into the compound to kill his enemies?
