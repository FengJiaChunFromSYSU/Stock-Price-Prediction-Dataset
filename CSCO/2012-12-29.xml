I should get 5%.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1356805669848</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:27:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356805799190-38</Id><Topic><Title>JUNIORSCLASSMATE AND I LOVE TO TOUCH WANGS...HEHEHE</Title><Username>surfnpea</Username><Timestamp>1356800275584</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 11:57:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The life of married gays is so wonderful.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1356805799190</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:29:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356805868049-39</Id><Topic><Title>Wall Street Criminals invented the 401k, the dirty politicians approved it, and</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1356725203371</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 15:06:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of slaves,Surf, I understand Rational bought you a really nice dog collar for your S &amp; M games.

Obama, if The New York Times scoop was right yesterday about the new terms he put on the table, has done plenty of compromising, especially for the guy who won the election. Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi are behind him. So the Democrats are ready to play ball. The only thing the Republicans are ready to play, as usual, is roulette, with the cocked gun against the country’s temple, unfortunately, and not their own. It’s worth taking a moment in this context to consider: Never have the priorities for survival and success of a major party’s Washington politicians been so utterly at odds with the priorities required for the country’s survival and success. These Washington Republicans represent the one-third of the country that hates government, despises Obama, and considers obstruction victory. The rational two-thirds wants compromise, good-faith bargaining, higher taxes on the wealthy, a reasonably strong safety net, and lower defense spending. But the obstructionist one-third wants the opposite. McConnell and Boehner aren’t ideologically committed to that one-third in the way that Jim DeMint and Paul Ryan are, but so far, they have never once stood up to it for the country’s sake. We’ll find out this weekend who they really are.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356806412877</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:40:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356806588381-45</Id><Topic><Title>GOP continues to think destroying the country is good politics</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356806412877</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:40:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You guys are such idiots.

It is often used as a metaphor for an intractable problem (disentangling an "impossible" knot) solved easily by cheating or "thinking outside the box" ("cutting the Gordian knot"): At one time the Phrygians were without a king. An oracle at Telmissus (the ancient capital of Phrygia) decreed that the next man to enter the city driving an ox-cart should become their king. A peasant farmer named Gordias drove into town on an ox-cart. His position had also been predicted earlier by an eagle landing on his cart, a sign to him from the gods, and on entering the city Gordias was declared king by the priests. Out of gratitude, his son Midas dedicated the ox-cart to the Phrygian god Sabazios (whom the Greeks identified with Zeus) and either tied it to a post or tied its shaft with an intricate knot of cornel bark. The ox-cart still stood in the palace of the former kings of Phrygia at Gordium in the fourth century BC when Alexander arrived. In 333 BC, while wintering at Gordium, Alexander the Great attempted to untie the knot. When he could not find the end to the knot to unbind it, he sliced it in half with a stroke of his sword, producing the required ends (the so-called "Alexandrian solution"). That night there was a violent thunderstorm. Alexander's prophet Aristander took this as a sign that Zeus was pleased and would grant Alexander many victories. Once Alexander had sliced the knot with a sword-stroke, his biographers claimed in retrospect that an oracle further prophesied that the one to untie the knot would become the king of Asia. Alexander later went on to conquer Asia as far as the Indus and the Oxus thus, for Callisthenes, fulfilling the prophecy. We need a terrible swift sword.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1356831400839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 20:36:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356832034144-134</Id><Topic><Title>just another tea bagger murder,</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1356818977595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 17:09:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The story sounds awful suspicious.

District Attorney Richard A. Brown identified the woman as Erika Menendez. She was awaiting arraignment. "(She) said in sum and substance 'I pushed a Muslim off the train tracks because I hate Hindus and Muslims ever since 2001 when they put down the twin towers I've been beating them up,'" the prosecutor said in a statement. Witnesses said a woman paced the platform and talked to herself Thursday evening shortly before pushing the man as the 11-car train entered the station.

Erika Menendez, 31, was hit with a second-degree murder charge after confessing to killing Sunando Sen, 46, following her arrest this morning. “She is accused of committing a subway commuter’s worst nightmare," Queens DA Richard Brown said. "(He was) suddenly and senselessly pushed into the path of an oncoming train, shoved from behind with no chance to defend himself. Push victim Sunando Sen The sketch the police used to bust Muslim-hater Erika Menendez.“She told police that she pushed a Muslim off the train tracks. She said, ‘I’ve hated Hindus and Muslims since 2001 since they put down the Twin Towers. I have been beating them up since.'” Cops picked up Menendez in Brooklyn early this morning after spotting her wearing the same jacket seen in surveillance video the night that Sen was fatally shoved into the path of the 7 train at the elevated 40th Street-Lowery stop in Sunnyside, law-enforcement sources said. Menendez was grabbed around 5 a.m. on the corner of Empire Boulevard and Bedford Avenue in Crown Heights, the sources said. The incoherent suspect was mumbling as cops questioned her, and at one point asked where the R train was, the sources added. Her relatives called cops last night after seeing her on the news, law-enforcement sources said. Menendez could have a criminal background -- and possibly a history of mental health issues, the sources said. She has recently been living in homeless shelters. The suspect was taken to the 112th Precinct in Forest Hills."</Msg><Username>democrat_cocoon_of_terror</Username><Timestamp>1356837836271</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 22:23:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356837959748-154</Id><Topic><Title>JUNIORSCLASSMATE SAYS HE plans to "Watch the Ball Drop" on</Title><Username>surfnpea</Username><Timestamp>1356826856562</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 19:20:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he's one filthy perverted little creep all right, I was hoping it meant he was going to stand beneath a falling wrecking ball</Msg><Username>donkeydouchebags</Username><Timestamp>1356837959748</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 22:25:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356838154620-155</Id><Title>DOGNAPPING UP 70%, MOST DOGNAPPERS WORE HOODIES AND LOOKED LIKE TRAVON MARTIN</Title><Msg>From CBS New York: "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Dogs are being stolen out of cars, yards, off sidewalks and even out of shelters at an alarming rate, according to the American Kennel Club."
