Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) announced it has completed its acquisition of cybersecurity company Sourcefire. This move by Cisco marks another important gain as the company now boasts one of the industry’s most comprehensive cybersecurity portfolios. The transaction, valued at around $2.7B, involves Cisco purchasing every share of Sourcefire for $76.00 per share and assuming some outstanding equity awards. Cisco Security Group senior vice president Christopher Young commented that the acquisition and Cisco’s portfolio offers comprehensive solutions for customers before, during, and after a cyber attack. Martin Roesch, founder and chief technology officer of Sourcefire, will now become vice president and chief architect for Cisco Security Group. All Sourcefire shares will be delisted from the NASDAQ stock exchange by close of business today.</Msg><Username>adspatz</Username><Timestamp>1381243434001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 10:43:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381244085888-47</Id><Topic><Title>tea billie terrorist</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381241190690</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 10:06:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes</Msg><Username>junior_makes_hicks_crazy</Username><Timestamp>1381244085888</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 10:54:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381244159369-48</Id><Title>GLOBAL PRESSURE WILL FORCE OBAMA AND BOEHBONER TO END THE SHUTDOWN</Title><Msg>THIS IS THE ONE FACTOR THAT WILL END IT.</Msg><Username>futureperson</Username><Timestamp>1381244159369</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 10:55:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381244161607-49</Id><Topic><Title>queenie is obsessed not unlike larry craig</Title><Username>junior_makes_hicks_crazy</Username><Timestamp>1381240931329</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 10:02:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe because I'm not Dead either, Dumb.

John] Boehner (R-OH) promised he wouldn’t attach demands to the Senate funding bill if it was brought in at the Republican level. Wasn’t that a negotiation?” Labrador said that $988 billion is not actually an accurate number, that this was the sequester level of 2013, whereas his caucus is now discussing funding for 2014. “Did Harry Reid lie?” asked Cooper. Labrador ignored the question at first, then said that he wasn’t present at the negotiations between Reid and Boehner, which he said may or may not have happened. Cooper argued that Obamacare has been passed, it’s the law of the land, ratified by Congress and the Supreme Court and two presidential elections. Labrador countered that he and other tea partiers were not yet elected when the law was passed. “So you’re nullifying two presidential elections and you’re nullifying the vote of Congress because you don’t like it,” Cooper said, “and I get that and your district is placed well.” “Your argument is that the House of Representatives doesn’t matter,” said Labrador. He accused Cooper of siding with the Democrats, saying that “just because you don’t like that the House of Representatives is Republican,” you can’t tell us when to vote on continuing resolutions. “Look, I don’t have a stake in this,” Cooper said. “This is the way it works in journalism. When you’re not on Fox News, you get contentious interviews. When you’re not on MSNBC and a liberal, you get contentious interviews.” “My job is to ask you questions,” he went on. “Just as my next guest who is a Democrat, I’m going to ask the same kind of questions and push back o</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo12</Username><Timestamp>1381245096198</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 11:11:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381245355203-56</Id><Topic><Title>GLOBAL PRESSURE WILL FORCE OBAMA AND BOEHBONER TO END THE SHUTDOWN</Title><Username>futureperson</Username><Timestamp>1381244159369</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 10:55:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol. the entire world depends on us default.</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1381245355203</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 11:15:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381245784927-57</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama RAN on his RECORD for his SECOND TERM.......

As a result, the VA cut off public access Tuesday to all 56 regional offices where veterans routinely walk in to file claims for compensation of combat- or other service-related wounds, injuries or illnesses. Major veteran service organizations expressed outrage Tuesday that these facilities were temporarily shuttered because many of their employees use this office space to assist veterans in preparing what are often complex compensation claims. "Because Congress and the White House refuse to speak to each other, our country's veterans are suffering more with each passing day of this extremely dangerous impasse," said Daniel Dellinger, national commander of the American Legion, the largest veterans organization with 2.4 million members. It remains unclear whether the VA will be sending out compensation checks on Nov. 1 to about 3.8 million veterans who rely on them, department spokeswoman Victoria Dillon says. While the VA is continuing to process compensation cases this month, funding for this will run out by the end of October if the shutdown continues, she says.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1381263826251</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 16:23:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381264228848-151</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Steps Up Pressure on House Republicans</Title><Username>william_fagot</Username><Timestamp>1381263340285</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 16:15:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What lies?</Msg><Username>pvcowboy6</Username><Timestamp>1381264228848</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 16:30:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381264310515-152</Id><Topic><Title>Being stalked by a pervert</Title><Username>juniorsuckslittleboys</Username><Timestamp>1381263288016</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 16:14:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL.</Msg><Username>juniorsuckslittleboys</Username><Timestamp>1381264310515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-10-08 16:31:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381264549542-153</Id><Title>CSCO is down as posted yesterday before the market closed</Title><Msg>I Was 100% Right Again.

So basically, the new design, approved by 85% of House and 49% of the Senate is to cut the Federal budget by 78% immediately, eliminating 5 cabinet level programs, including EPA, Dept of Education, OSHA, DOT, moving the FAA into a consortium of airline and state funded administrators for management of airline travel. The DoD will remain 90% funded and will have its Defense funds cut 2% a year for 5 years...then will level off. ICE will be gutted and all border agents will be doubled. Customs will cease to exist and inspections will be done by State authorities. FBI will be shut down and state law will run state law.
