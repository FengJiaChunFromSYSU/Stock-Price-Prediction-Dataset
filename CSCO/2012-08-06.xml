Obama only counts people who have not run out of benefits, if you have been out of work long enough to run out of benefit checks your no longer counted. These people are now on welfare, or somehow talked themselves onto SSI. A lot of these Americans are the ones losing their homes to foreclosures, losing their cars to repos or being thrown out of apartments for not being able to pay rent. And Obama he is on vacation , playing Golf, attending fundraisers, with the one percenters in Hollyweird. He evolved so he could take Gay Money, with a Straight Face. Obama is a Phoney.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1344231166524</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 01:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344231413260-3</Id><Topic><Title>Obama won Indiana in 2008.

Every county has some discretion over questions such as exactly how long the polls may stay open on voting days, and each county elections board is made up of two members from each party regardless of how the county itself tends to vote. When a committee deadlocks in any county the tie vote gets broken by Jon Husted, the Republican Secretary of State. Here’s how the game works. In urban counties, GOP committee members vote to close polls at 5 pm, a time that is inconvenient as impossible for many people who work for a living. So far Husted has always broken the tie in favor of less voting, as one might expect. The counties encompassing Cleveland, Cincinnatti and Akron, three of Ohio’s largest cities, will thus operate under “business hours” only. In suburban counties at least one GOP committee member will vote for extended hours and the polls stay open quite late. I don't care what side of the aisle you are on, if you don't find this type of abuse of power appalling you are a terrible American and a poor excuse for a citizen. -Oscar Dimwitty</Msg><Username>oscar_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1344275553856</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 13:52:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344276245127-74</Id><Topic><Title>FLUTE/DEAD/VEGAS_HOOKER CATCH A BREAK...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344271052161</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 12:37:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You've done it more than once you redneck HYPOCRITE.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1344276245127</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 14:04:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344277384453-75</Id><Topic><Title>reid is an idiot</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1344255931561</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 08:25:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is losing , he is raising less money every month, he has spent several times more on campaign adds here in Nevada, and D.

National Policy Director James Kvaal wraps up what we know about Mitt Romney’s economic plan to raise taxes on the middle class while giving tax breaks to the wealthy: We learned a lot about Mitt Romney’s tax plan this week. Here’s a recap in case you missed it. For months, Romney has insisted that he will pay for his $5 trillion tax plan by closing tax deductions—but he won’t tell us which ones. Thanks to a new report from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, we know that there is no way to fill in the blanks without raising middle class taxes. Here’s the report, our summary, and a calculator to help you see how Romney’s plan would impact you and your family. A look at what we learned: Romney’s plan offers a large tax cut for the wealthy, no matter how you slice it: Romney’s tax cuts for the wealthy are so large that closing every tax benefit they get—other than preferential rates on investment income, which Romney says he won’t touch—would still cut the average multi-millionaire’s taxes by $250,000. That’s just math. And it comes on top of all the Bush tax cuts. They have no way to pay for these tax cuts: Romney and his campaign have emphasized that his tax cuts would be “revenue-neutral”—meaning no net loss of tax revenue. But if you are cutting taxes on the top, that means you have to raise taxes for everyone else. And while Romney’s advisors said the economy would grow, they ignored the fact that, even when the Tax Policy Center considered unrealistically generous estimates (derived from the academic work of Romney’s own advisor), they concluded that Romney’s plan couldn’t create enough growth to pay for his tax cuts for the wealthy. They refused to clarify his plan: Romney had said that his tax plan “can’t be scored.” Now we know what Romney really meant: that he didn’t want it to be scored. Walking through the details means showing that he is paying for deep tax cuts for the wealthy with tax increases on the middle class. As Josh Barro put it, “If Romney thinks TPC missed something, and he has a way to make his plan work without a middle class tax increase, he should release the details that show what that is. So long as he refuses to tell us exactly what his tax plan is, Romney has no one to blame for distortions of the plan but himself.” The bottom line: Filling in the blanks on Romney’s plan requires large tax increase on the middle class. Don’t take my word for it—take a look at what others have found. Ezra Klein: “The numbers never worked out. No matter how hard the Tax Policy Center labored to make Romney’s promises add up, every simulation ended the same way: with a tax increase on the middle class.” Wall Street Journal: “A new study released Wednesday suggests that Mitt Romney’s tax plan would benefit the rich and hurt the poor and middle class, no matter how current blanks in the plan are filled in.” Factcheck.org: “Romney has said he would offset the loss of personal income tax revenue (estimated at $360 billion a year by the Tax Policy Center) by reducing tax deductions and credits. And he has said he would do this while making sure that those at the top keep paying the ‘same share of the tax burden they’re paying now … Romney has failed to produce evidence that what he promises is possible. And we judge that the weight of evidence and expert opinion is clear —it’s not possible.” Jonathan Chait: “Mitt Romney appears to have blundered his way into a bona fide political disaster with his tax plan.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1344280281523</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:11:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344280328125-90</Id><Topic><Title>Go to D.

Morris is a real pro, has worked for both dems and republicans, and won for both parties. Actually he is now just citing a poll he has seen the internals of that doesn't skew the results by playing Dem gains of oversampling the dems by 19%. The poll is of likely not registered voters so it captures the intensity factor of likely turnout. The thing is that the undecided are not really factored into the results and that is very good for Romney that he is over 50% in so many states at this point. The undecided break historically according to Morris 80%-20% for the challenger, since the incumbent is assumed to have formed a firm opinion with voters. Obama's record will sink him and all his negative adds about Romney and his class warfare will backfire on him. After all didn't the Dems Run Kennedy, Roosevelt, Kerry who were all real rich so being rich is only supposed to matter for a Republican? Nancy Pelosi is really rich, so are a lot of Democrats.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1344290247746</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 17:57:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344291251053-109</Id><Topic><Title>Go to D.

One benighted Newsweek reporter even speculated about a possible Democratic landslide. On Friday, I saw the real numbers. These state-by-state polls, taken by an organization I trust (after forty years of polling) show the real story. The tally is based on more than 600 likely voter interviews in each swing state within the past eight days. The trend line is distinctly pro-Romney. Of the thirteen states studied, he improved or Obama slipped in nine states while the reverse happened in only four. To read the media, one would think that Romney had a terrible month. In fact, the exact reverse is true. Romney is currently leading in every state McCain carried plus: Indiana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Nevada, North Carolina, and Colorado. If he carries these states, he'll have 228 electoral votes of the 270 he needs to win. To win the election, Romney would then have to carry Florida where he trails by two points, and either Virginia (behind by two) or Ohio where he's down by only one. If he carries all three of these states and also wins all the others where Obama is now at 50% or less - Iowa, New Mexico, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey -- he will get 351 electoral votes, a landslide about equal to Obama's 363 vote tally in 2008. The strong probability is that Romney does, in fact, carry Florida, Ohio, and Virginia and a share of the other states where Obama is below 50% of the vote. So don't believe the garbage being put out by the media. The attempt to portray Romney as not catching on and as dropping in the polls is ludicrous. It is, at best, the product of incompetent polling and, at worst, the result of deliberate media bias. But Romney is winning and expanding his lead each week. That's the real story.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1344291251053</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 18:14:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344294433394-110</Id><Topic><Title>Dumping on the little people</Title><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1344282828432</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 15:53:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He went to London 2012 Olympics to see dancing horse performing.</Msg><Username>doctor_hardon</Username><Timestamp>1344294433394</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 19:07:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344295615443-111</Id><Title>Saved GM, Killed Bin Laden, Dug Out of "The Bush Hole", Delivered Curiosity to Mars</Title><Msg>This man is full of miricles.
