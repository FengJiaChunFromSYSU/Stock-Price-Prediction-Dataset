The $500,000,000 that Obama spent moslem brotherhood terorists in Egypt could have hired 52,000 minimum wage Americans and the money would remain the USA instead of being used by Egyption moslem brotherhood America haters to wage war against America. With Obama it is always foreigners and enemies of America first and Americans get the shaft.</Msg><Username>democrat_cocoon_gay_perversions</Username><Timestamp>1364147573332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 13:52:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364147655209-40</Id><Topic><Title>DEMOCRAT SENATOR MENENDEZ SEX PARTIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN= NO MORALS OR DECENCY</Title><Username>weiner_the_peter_tweeter</Username><Timestamp>1360296154630</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 23:02:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Couldn't agree more.

Obama you owe the American people a responsible, balanced budget. Our skyrocketing debt is damaging our economy and threatening our future. It's time to change course. Today, the GOP is introducing a plan to do just that. House Republicans are offering a common-sense plan to balance the budget in ten years. The Senate Democrats' budget, on the other hand, never balances - ever. Balancing the budget isn't just about making numbers on a spreadsheet line up. It's about the well-being of the country. A balanced budget will revive our economy and expand opportunity. Now do your job Mr. Obama. Already Democrats are falsely attacking our budget. We need your support to help us push back and put in place real solutions to our fiscal challenges.

A central Pennsylvania father shot and killed his 2-year-old son and wounded his estranged wife during a custody exchange before killing himself, authorities said. Police said Kenneth Ayers also shot at his mother during the altercation Saturday morning at her home in a rural area about 20 miles southwest of State College. Huntingdon County District Attorney George Zanic said Ayers, 52, was subject to a protection from abuse order filed by his wife but was permitted visits with his son, Michael. Saturday's visit was to happen at his mother's home in Barree Township. But once at the home, Ayers got into an altercation with his estranged wife, Hollie Jo, and shot her in the legs and arm with a .40 caliber handgun before intentionally shooting his son, police said. Kenneth Ayers placed the child's body in the back of his vehicle but the wounded woman retrieved the body before Ayers shot her again in the face, police said. He also fired at his mother but missed.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364156693073</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 16:24:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364160638916-75</Id><Title>WHY DO FILTHY REPUBLICAN DIRTBAGS LIKE goparegreatfolk9</Title><Msg>All have about 10 seperate yahoo accounts with about30+ aliases to stroke themselves with?</Msg><Username>cpncork</Username><Timestamp>1364160638916</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 17:30:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364163747556-76</Id><Topic><Title>-Karl Rove: "I An Imagine The Next GOP Presidential Candidate as Being a Gay'</Title><Username>sonuvati111</Username><Timestamp>1364156822676</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 16:27:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that will really bring out the tea billie vote, LOL face it the GOP spent the last 20 years locking up the racist, homophobic vote and now that vote is a minority and no one wants to be in the same tent</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1364163747556</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 18:22:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364166682618-77</Id><Title>BEYONCE dedicates new song to Obama -♫♪ ♫ ♫♪ Yes Barack Your a Big Spender $$$ ♫ ♪♫♪ ♫ ♫♪ ♫ ♪ and liar to</Title><Msg>BEYONCE dedicates new song to Obama -♫♪ ♫ ♫♪ Yes Barack Your a Big Spender $$$ ♫ ♪♫♪ ♫ ♫♪ ♫ ♪ and liar to ♫♪ ♫ Now come clean admit you love smoking still too.

And then she did something amazing. Instead of playing stenographer for The State about the sequester cuts, Attkisson turned a story about frivolous government waste into a sequester story. How does the federal government -- she asks in so many words -- have all kinds of money to waste $60,000 on a "Star Trek" spoof, but not enough to ensure planes land safely? Thus begins a six-minute "Star Trek" parody starring IRS employees and paid for with your tax dollars. It's not likely to go over well with some Americans and members of Congress, especially since federal agencies have been complaining that it's difficult to find trims under forced sequestration. CBS News filed a Freedom of Information request asking for the video after the IRS earlier refused to turn over a copy to the congressional committee that oversees tax issues: House Ways and Means. According to committee Chairman Charles Boustany, Jr. (R-LA), the video was produced in the IRS's own television studio in New Carrollton, MD. The studio may have cost taxpayers more than $4 million dollars last year alone. Finally, a legitimate sequester story! By the way, that video was produced in 2010 when the federal budget was smaller than it is today. The federal government is currently running annual deficits of a trillion dollars-plus, and yet Obama's Media wants us to believe the budget is so lean and mean that a two-percent cut will force control towers to close. That's horse-hockey, and everyone knows it -- including Obama's Media. The real sequester story is how trillions of dollars can be so horribly mismanaged that a measly budget cut of two-percent results in gaping holes in airline safety.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1364178926797</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 22:35:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364182356408-90</Id><Title>Obama First President to defy a Federal Judge’s court order to cease implementing the Health Care Reform Law.</Title><Msg>Obama First President to defy a Federal Judge’s court order to cease implementing the Health Care Reform Law.</Msg><Username>goparegreatfolks9</Username><Timestamp>1364182356408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 23:32:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364182427819-91</Id><Title>Obama First President to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office.</Title><Msg>Obama First President to appoint 45 czars to replace elected officials in his office.</Msg><Username>goparegreatfolks9</Username><Timestamp>1364182427819</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 23:33:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364182447386-92</Id><Title>Obama First President to golf 115 separate times since taking Office.</Title><Msg>Obama First President to golf 115 separate times since taking Office.</Msg><Username>goparegreatfolks9</Username><Timestamp>1364182447386</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 23:34:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364182519290-93</Id><Title>Barry H.Obama First President to hide his medical, educational and travel records.

President Obama, therefore, must consider abortion a most pressing issue that must not only be legal, but funded here and abroad with taxpayer money regardless of where the public stands on the issue. According to Obama, “We must stay united in our determination to prevent unintended pregnancies, support pregnant women and mothers, reduce the need for abortion, encourage healthy relationships, and promote adoption.” I would be the first to shout amen at that speech if only his actions met his words. How exactly does funding abortion reduce the need for it? If our welfare state taught us anything, it is that subsidizing something does not reduce the need for it.
