I wondered how the 'smart boys' were going to do that. Now remember, the 'smart boys' are not Democrats...nor Republicans...just the ordinary financiers...yup! So when the debt is actually drowning the nation, how can the Feds still sell bonds and T-bills to keep paying their bills? Easy! Sell it to your self....and pay any interest rate you want. Of course, since the Federal Govt is selling bonds to the Federal Reserve, they don't have to pay any interest at all. Now, if you were trying sell trillions is useless paper to the Chinese, you'd be done. Game over. NO ONE BUYS. But as long as you sell it to your self....the entire charade can go on UNTIL WHAT HAPPENS? There is an answer... When does the game of 'Musical Chairs" come to crashing halt? When does the 'Federal Reserve Note' become just exactly that....useless paper, no matter how many zero's are added to the first digit? Obimbo knows the answer.

We will soon see the economic support that the Bush tax cuts provided as they evaporate and are replaced with higher tax rates and budget cuts. To get a sampling of what the combined impact of higher taxes and reduced government spending might feel like in 2013, all we have to do is take a look at Europe. Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece have all raised taxes and cut government spending in the past couple of years, and the resulting effects have been quite devastating. It did not take long for unemployment to spike and economic weakness to set in as consumers and businesses also cut spending. There will be riots in the street of America. Glen Beck was right. It took less than 4 years.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1352647283070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 10:21:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352647431581-21</Id><Title>Faux Noise Guest spells out exactly why the Prez won</Title><Msg>Fox News Guest: Obama Won by Lying About 'Rape Camps' Under Romney Posted: 10 Nov 2012 06:00 AM PST At least one conservative Fox News commentator isn't blaming Mitt Romney's loss on Hurricane Sandy. On Thursday, tea party-backed radio host Michael Graham told Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly that President Barack Obama scared voters by claiming that women would be "forced into rape camps" under the Republican presidential nominee. Graham explained that Obama was not elected with a mandate because "he didn't run on an affirmative campaign." "He ran on the Republicans are Satan incarnate and if women vote for them, they're going to be forced into rape camps," the radio host insisted. "And when that's your campaign, you can't be surprised when the people you ran against don't want to work with you and you don't have an issue to rally people around."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1352647431581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 10:23:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352648007332-22</Id><Topic><Title>Faux Noise Guest spells out exactly why the Prez won</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1352647431581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 10:23:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama's negative campaign is going to cause him and the country problems -- no deal on the fiscal cliff for the negative bas*turd.

The misery will continue to get worse.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1352650149249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 11:09:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352650427695-32</Id><Title>Obama Regime, 1455 days Remain...</Title><Msg>...and counting</Msg><Username>carrik.fergus</Username><Timestamp>1352650427695</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 11:13:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352650614495-33</Id><Title>Hillary Clinton President 2016 why Bother with Election</Title><Msg>To embarrass Republicans as they advocate Vaginal Probes and Rapes</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1352650614495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 11:16:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352650698056-34</Id><Title>Newt Gingrich,,,will run in 2016</Title><Msg>On the Moon Colony Ticket</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1352650698056</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 11:18:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352650775708-35</Id><Topic><Title>SAD OLD FAT WHITE INBRED WHITE MEN</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1352639924674</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 08:18:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Christies lives at McDonalds</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1352650775708</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 11:19:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352650888233-36</Id><Topic><Title>SAD OLD WHITE MEN.....</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1352591545053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 18:52:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You lost your SLAVES,,,Get over it,,,so We Burned Down the SOUTH..You want us to Burn it down again.....Confederacy is Dead</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1352650888233</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 11:21:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352650953060-37</Id><Title>Someone Tell White People Confederacy was Burned Down</Title><Msg>it is Dead and Gone and will NOT Return</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1352650953060</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 11:22:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352650968600-38</Id><Topic><Title>BUT ROMNEY LOST, why are YOU REPUBLICANS still posting here?</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1352594762681</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 19:46:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm an independent, dopey, not a (R).

It's pretty easy to identify parasites, those who live at the expense of others...// And AGAIN you put your finger on it (not for the first time, I'm sure, eh WalWal?...): you're again referring rather clearly to middle managers and above. These same who have sought at every turn to undercut wages, to roll back workplace safety requirements, to Welsh on pension, healthcare and other obligations, and in a hundred other ways to seek to "put workers in their proper place" (wage slaves will have to do, alas, as actual slaves have come to be frowned upon by the wild-eyed radical liberal/progressive/leftist crowd), to socialize/"externalize" costs and losses of every kind, transferring them to the public at large (or to their own employees in particular), to pay hordes of K Street lobbyists to draft sui generis special protections and advantages and benefits into "model" legislation for the rubber stamp of a boughtandpaidfor Congress (RepubliCONs, mostly, but -- no denying it -- also a significant percentage of DemoCON DINOs). These same whose Mephistophelean anti-Pareto machinations and glibfibs (think the Grinch's quickfooted recovery in response to Cindy Lou Who's earnest question) have led with staggering success (the Southern voter being what he/she is... see an earlier post) to ALL the fruits (AND THEN SOME, by about an other 14% in real wages adjusted for inflation) of improved worker efficiency and productivity during the past 30+ years flowing up to the top 1% (and a handful of their choice lackeys/mouthpieces/apologists). "Work harder, work smarter, EARN LESS!!!" just wouldn't have had the desired effect... On September 24, 2012, I was astonished to find displayed on an unsolicited interstitial popup screen the following Forbes Thought of the Day: “When a man tells you he got rich through hard work, ask him: Whose?” - Don Marquis. Too TOO true, that... Which is why I'm sure there were at least a couple of layoffs in the Forbes editorial department later that day.</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1352680757179</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 19:39:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352681324743-104</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes Thought Of The Day - September 24, 2012</Title><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1348492873292</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 09:21:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you have a purpose in life?
