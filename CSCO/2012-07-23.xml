Obumbles STILL has forces in Iraq, RAMPED up Afghanistan and then illegally attacked Libya. Now some real facts for the board LIAR. Bush had some NET 5 milliion more jobs than when he took office, Obumbles has NET lost around 1 million for the last 3 1/2 years. He hasn't created ANYTHING, all he has done has put 4.4 million back to work of the 5 million plus that lost their jobs under his reign. How about a basketbal analogy, based on your arguement if you were behind in the first half by 30 points, but in the second half you outscored your opponent by 10, you and Obumbles would be telling everyone you won, yet you lost the game by 20 frickiiingggg points you #$%$ You jackwagons cherry pick your data whenever you want to support your lame arguement. Obumbles has NOT added more private jobs than bush, Obumbles is still in the negative catagory.

Quick guide....</Title><Msg>Just before dying of cancer in 1991 at the premature age of 40, Lee Atwater (Richard Nixon's "dirty tricks" Meister, and Karl Rove's mentor) made the following statement: “I was wrong to follow the meanness of Conservatism. I should have been trying to help people instead of take advantage of them. I don’t hate anyone anymore. For the first time in my life I don’t hate somebody. I have nothing but good feelings toward people. I’ve found Jesus Christ – It’s that simple. He’s made a difference.” Do you buy any of it? Or was it maybe Atwater's biggest, grandest CON of all - an attempt to convince God (and even himself, on some level) that he repented of all the calculated, premeditated evil which formed the core of his adult life, and thereby squeak into heaven by a hair's breadth (this coming from a man who years earlier referred to the religious right wing of the conservative movement as "extra chromosome" voters...)?

These are the facts, unfortunately I don't think it matters to a d1ck hole like you. Even with today’s disappointing and troubling jobs report, private sector job creation under President Obama has far exceeded private sector job creation under President Bush. 40 months into his presidential term, there are currently more private sector jobs in the economy than when Obama came into office. At the same point in President Bush’s term, the total number of private sector jobs was still down 1.7 percent from where it began. The numbers are even starker when measuring each president’s record from the moment job creation returned. Private sector job creation returned in February of 2010, the 13th month of President Obama’s term. Since then, the economy has added 4.3 million private sector jobs, a 4 percent increase. Under President Bush, the economy stopped shedding private sector jobs in July of 2003, fully 30 months into his administration. From that point until May of 2004, the economy added just 1.5 million private sector jobs, an increase of only 1.4 percent. Why do you keep trying, don't you know it will always be a repeat ?

That's a net increase of 0.05%. * We have experienced 27 months of positive private-sector job GROWTH from February 2010 until May 2012. We have added 4,268,000 private-sector jobs during those 26 months. We now have 111,040,000 PRIVATE sector non-farm jobs. How many GOVERNMENT jobs have been lost or gained since Obama was inaugurated? 102,000 GOVERNMENT jobs (in seasonally adjusted numbers) were LOST from the time Obama took office until the "trough" of the recession in early 2010. That's a decrease of .47% (about half of a percent). Another 505,000 GOVERNMENT jobs (in seasonally adjusted numbers) were LOST from the "trough" of the recession until now, May 2012. That's a decrease of 2.25%. In total, 607,000 government jobs (in seasonally adjusted numbers) were LOST from the time Obama took office until now, May 2012.

And the one place we should have shut back — or cut back — was on government jobs. We have 145,000 more government workers under this president. Let’s send them home and put you back to work.” — Mitt Romney, in Craig, Colo., May 29, 2012 There’s a lot going on in this quote by the presumptive Republican nominee, which a reader asked us to fact-check. Romney disparages President Obama’s $830 billion stimulus bill for allegedly not helping to create private sector jobs. He also dings government workers, suggesting that the president’s policies have led to a bloat of government workers — and that this is a bad thing for other workers. Let’s take a deeper look at his claims. The Facts We have to admit that the statement is bit confusing, because it appears to mix different thoughts. The stimulus bill included payments to states to help save “government” jobs, such as those of teachers, firefighters and the like. But then Romney refers to “145,000 more government workers,” which is correct only if he is referring to federal workers, not state workers. As we have noted before, Romney has previously used the 145,000 figure in a misleading way, but in that instance he clearly said he was referring to federal workers. In this context, since the first part of his statement suggests he is talking about state government workers, the second part would be wrong, because the number of government workers overall has dramatically declined under Obama. The latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that nearly 610,000 government jobs have been lost since January 2009, with much of the loss coming since 2010, as the stimulus funds have begun to run out. Just in the past few months, about 30,000 government jobs have been lost, even as the number of private sector jobs has increased by more than 300,000. (Overall, since January 2009, the number of private sector jobs has increased by 55,000 because the numbers plunged deeply in 2009.) If we assume that Romney was actually referring to federal government jobs, not all government jobs, then the claim of a 145,000 increase since January 2009 is accurate. (The May data released on June 1 dropped the figure slightly, from 146,000 to 143,000.) But as we have written, much of that increase has come in areas that Romney says he wants to bolster as president, such as defense (80,000 additional jobs), veterans affairs (38,000) and homeland security (20,000). Presumably he would think such increases are a good thing — not jobs he would want to eliminate.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343096749886</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 22:25:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343096911156-123</Id><Topic><Title>facts drive the baggers crazy</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343095984584</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 22:13:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let us know when Obama starts using facts rather than the constant stream of steady lies.

Jon Kyl (R-AZ) defended Republicans’ willingness to shut down the government over funding for Planned Parenthood by falsely claiming that abortion is “well over 90 percent of what Planned Parenthood does.” In reality, just three percent of its work is related to abortion. This afternoon, CNN brought on Planned Parenthood’s Judy Tabar to discuss his comment. During the interview, CNN anchor TJ Holmes relayed a statement from Kyl’s office walking back the comment, claiming the statement was not meant to be “factual”: HOLMES: We did call his office trying to ask what he was talking about there. And I just want to give it you verbatim here. It says, ‘his remark was not intended to be a factual statement, but rather to illustrate that Planned Parenthood, a organization that receives millions of dollars in taxpayer funding, does subsidize abortions.’ of course GOP comments weren't meant to be factual they are meant to mislead!!</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1343097976213</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 22:46:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343098294212-128</Id><Title>BEAR KOK READY TO RIP A NEW HOLE FOR CSCO</Title><Msg>DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
