Jesse Jackson Jr. is already underway. The Chicago Tribune reports that the special election field could get very crowded. Given the short time frame for a special election, and the chance for politicians to make a run for Congress without jeopardizing any office they currently hold, name recognition and dollars are of the utmost importance in trying to secure victory among a potentially crowded Democratic primary field. The winner of that race is likely to win the general election as well. "You've got so many candidates who say they're going to be running, it could be a free-for-all," Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios, chairman of the county's Democratic Party, said Friday. "We want to make sure we elect someone who works hard to represent everyone in Chicago, everyone in Cook County and everyone in the 2nd Congressional District." Someone who is not black.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353821145775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 00:25:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353821286149-2</Id><Topic><Title>I Stand Corrected ...

Upton Sinclair I think Sinclair said it perfectly. I am getting so tired of listening to the litany of prognosticators and pundits who suggest that a fiscal cliff solution is forthcoming. There is no solution. As Sinclair states - their "salary depends upon not understanding it." Recession regardless. Worst case is a sudden fiscal crisis, during which investors would lose confidence in the government's ability to manage its budget and the government would thereby lose its ability to borrow at affordable rates. Such a crisis would confront policymakers with extremely difficult choices. Again, the current high level of debt relative to the size of the economy means that further substantial increases in debt would be especially risky in this regard.

Even so, GDP growth is only running at about 2%. $1 trillion represents 6.25% of total GDP. Do the math -- if we weren't borrowing and spending $1 trillion a year GDP growth would be a negative 4%. That, of course, would result in more costs cuts and lay offs, which would reduce the tax base and the consumer pool. In other words we end up with an economy that ends up spinning down on itself like Greece. This is just simple math. We have reached a tipping point where we are almost assured of another credit downgrade if we don't deal with what has become run away deficit spending and unsustainable debt. How we deal with the "fiscal cliff" really doesn't matter at this point but there are those who don't seem to realize or accept this inconvenient truth.

Because – as we learned the hard way on election day – he can watch the polls with the best of them. And if this train goes off the rails he has reason to believe that he won’t be left holding the bag. A new poll by Hart Research’s Geoff Garin, conducted for Americans for Tax Fairness — a group that wants the Bush-era tax cuts to end for those who earn more than $250,000 — found that a majority of voters cited changing the tax system as a key factor in their votes, and that the majority broke for President Barack Obama. The survey also found that Democrats have changed the landscape on an issue that has eluded them for years — taxes. The survey found that most want the Bush-era cuts on top earners to expire, but that Republicans will shoulder blame if all of the Bush cuts, including those on the middle class, expire because a deal can’t be reached. Basically, this works out to a win-win for Obama. Yes, he could look like the great peacemaker and try to strike some sort of grand bargain with Boehner. And if he did, he would likely get some of what he and the Democratic majority want in exchange for taking a slightly less than maximum raise on taxes for the most wealthy. But why? If he takes a very hard line and forces the showdown to a collapse in discussions, several potentially positive (for him) results are baked into the cake. He can claim that Republicans refused a “balanced approach” and it’s their fault that everyone’s taxes went up. He then has the Democrats force a vote on a bill to only lower taxes on the middle class and the poor and just dares the GOP to vote against it. (They won’t.) At this point he has the tax / revenue increase he promised without giving up a single thing. Now the negotiations start anew to talk about “spending cuts” but the GOP’s major bargaining chip is gone. Obama gets to put up a far more shallow version of cuts, and if the Republicans don’t like it, they can choose to reject the deal and just let the deficit continue to skyrocket.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353861867603</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 11:44:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353861989547-37</Id><Topic><Title>GOP built the fiscal cliff</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353860749014</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 11:25:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wake UP buddy.

They may not have been able to propel one of their own to the White House, but despite all their resentment and complaining things have never been better for the country's economic Übermenschen. Not only do they hold more of the nation's wealth than at any time since the Gilded Age, the privileges of that wealth have never been greater. Their taxes have never been lower. The entire world offers special concierge services to shield them from the indignities and inconveniences of everyday life. And now, they have new freedoms in the political realm as well; where they might have had to hold their tongues in the past, thanks to Citizens United they are now free to strong-arm their employees to vote in the right way, complete with threats of layoffs should the voters be so vulgar as to elect a Democratic president. Perhaps by the time 2016 arrives, the Republican party will find a message that resonates with voters more effectively than "You people make me sick." For now, though, that's what they're sticking with.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353863916104</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 12:18:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353864806391-44</Id><Topic><Title>GOP built the fiscal cliff</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353860749014</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 11:25:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Once AGAIN you are a LIAR. 11 voted FOR it 7 against.

Romney captured 57 percent of the electorate in Texas, to Obama's 41 percent — besting John McCain's 55 percent in 2008 and seemingly proving that the Lone Star state hasn't diluted its redness with even a drop of blue during Obama's first term. Still, given shifting demographics, prominent Republican officials are warning that Texas could soon become a swing state, with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently predicting that Texas could find itself in the toss-up category within four years. Here, a guide: How is Texas' electorate changing? Between 2000 and 2010, Texas added more people — 4.3 million — than any other state, according to the latest Census. Eight of the nation's 15 fastest-growing cities are located in Texas. Many people moving to Texas come from blue regions of the country, and the state's major urban centers — Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio — voted for Obama. Most worryingly for Republicans, 88 percent of Texas' 4.3 million new residents were Latino, black, or Asian — three groups that swung heavily for Obama in the election. What would a blue Texas mean for Republicans? In a word, death. Democrats hold a lock on California and the third-most valuable electoral state, New York. If Texas goes blue, "no Republican will ever again win the White House," Ted Cruz, the recently elected senator from Texas, told The New Yorker. "We won't be talking about Ohio, we won't be talking about Florida or Virginia, because it won't matter. If Texas is bright blue, you can't get to 270 electoral votes. The Republican Party would cease to exist."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353865106742</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 12:38:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353865235977-49</Id><Topic><Title>When Obama passes comprehensive immigration reform</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353865106742</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 12:38:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that the SAME immigration reform he PROMISED to pass 4 years ago.

The New York Times reported Thursday that Bush is "weighing financial and family considerations," according to those close to him. “It continues to intrigue him, given how much he has to share with the country,” said longtime friend and adviser Al Cardenas, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. "But conservatives are in no mood to find out what Bush has to share with the country," Twitchy said. "Whether due to Bush fatigue or doubt about his conservatism, they’re overwhelmingly urging Jeb to keep his hat firmly out of the ring." "RNC say no to Jeb Bush! For once, the RNC must support Conservatives," tweeted "Rick Barrett." "NO, NO NO NO... did I say NO, NO, NO, Absolutely NO," added "Eric Barnes." "He will lose. No one wants a Bush," said "Matthew R." "Aaaaand anybody pushing Jeb Bush in 2016 needs to excuse themselves from my timeline before I find them," added "GayPatriot." Twitchy posted 24 tweets from conservatives who made it clear in no uncertain terms that they do not want the former governor to run. Commenters at the Washington Times agreed. "Read My Lips, No New Bush!!" wrote "Randy." "Sure, let's lose again," added "MarvLS1." The New York Times observed that Bush attacked what he called "his party’s 'stupid' approach to illegal immigration," an attack that did not earn him any friends in the conservative wing of the Party. An article at Politico suggests that Bush might face Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, raising the possible spectacle of a repeat of the 1992 election. But conservatives are not eager to embrace yet another moderate, and after Romney's defeat, will not stand for another candidate they consider to be a "RINO," a "Republican in name only," no matter how fluent he is in Spanish.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353879012527</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-25 16:30:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353881624801-67</Id><Topic><Title>SurfnforBoyz Caught trying to teach a</Title><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1353779739077</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-24 12:55:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes you do that skip, remember every day.

Yelling fire in a crowded theater is ok as long as the Messiah says so. So let me get this straight, FROM DAY 1 Petraeus knew it was terrorism, Obama knew it was terrorism(ref. 3rd debate), BUT Susan Rice who Demcrats want to nominate as Secretary of State was the ONLY DUMB one in the room stupid enough to LIE claims she didn't know. Now the far left is crying racism because some would question her integrity. REALLY So according to the far left, it's ok to mislead the American people and LIE as long as Obama tells you to. I guess Democrats want a bunch of LIARS controlling the country.
