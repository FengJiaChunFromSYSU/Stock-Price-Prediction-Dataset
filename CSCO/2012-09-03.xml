Following the Republican National Convention in Tampa, 40 percent of voters said that they were more likely to support Mitt Romney for president, compared with 38 percent who were less likely — a net impact of +2. This is lowest net impact for a convention going back to 1984. By comparison, the 2008 GOP convention featuring Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) was +5, and that year’s Democratic convention nominating Barack Obama was +14. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney’s acceptance speech received the lowest marks since Bob Dole’s in 1996: 38 percent of respondents said that Romney’s speech was “excellent” or “good.” That figure is lower than McCain’s in 2008 (47 percent), Obama’s in that same year (58 percent), Bush’s in 2004 (49 percent) and Kerry’s that same year (52 percent).</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346676481606</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 08:48:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346678823401-5</Id><Title>Greed is good</Title><Msg>Mitt Romney – a man whose own father built cars and nurtured communities, and was one of the old-school industrial anachronisms pushed aside by the new generation's wealth grab – has emerged now to sell this make-nothing, take-everything, screw-everyone ethos to the world.

In 1980 she was the first woman to cross the finish line at the Boston Marathon — except it turned out that she hadn’t actually run most of the race, that she sneaked onto the course around a mile from the end. Ever since, she has symbolized a particular kind of fraud, in which people claim credit for achieving things they have not, in fact, achieved. And these days Paul Ryan is the Rosie Ruiz of American politics. This would have been an apt comparison even before the curious story of Mr. Ryan’s own marathon came to light. ... Mr. Ryan ... boasted ... that he had once run a marathon in less than three hours. ... It eventually transpired that ... his time was actually more than four hours. ... Mr. Ryan tried to laugh the whole thing off as a simple error. But ... the difference between sub-three and over-four is ... not something a runner could get wrong, unless he’s a fabulist who imagines his own reality. ... What makes this incident so striking is ... the way it resonates with the essential Rosie-Ruizness of Mr. Ryan’s whole political persona, which is built around big boasts about accomplishments he hasn’t accomplished. For Mr. Ryan ... has positioned himself as an icon of truth-telling and fiscal responsibility, while offering policy proposals that are neither honest nor responsible. ... Mr. Ryan basically told the budget office to assume that his plan would slash the deficit, then claimed the resulting report as vindication of his deficit-slashing claims. Sorry, but that’s the policy equivalent of sneaking into a marathon near the finish line, then claiming victory. Still, Mitt Romney, not Mr. Ryan, is the presidential candidate... So how does Romney/Ryan differ from Ryan alone? It’s worse. ... Realistically, the Romney plan would explode the deficit, not reduce it. Yet Mr. Romney boasts about his fiscal responsibility... Yep, he’s another Rosie Ruiz Republican. So what is this election about? To be sure, it’s about different visions of society — about Medicare versus Vouchercare, about preserving the safety net versus destroying it. But it’s also a test of how far politicians can bend the truth. This is surely the first time one of our major parties has run a campaign so completely fraudulent, making claims so at odds with the reality of its policy proposals. But if the Romney/Ryan ticket wins, it won’t be the last.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1346684613279</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:03:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346684759310-15</Id><Title>EGADS!

CHARLOTTE -- It doesn't look like Mitt Romney's poll position improved after last week's Republican national convention. Recent daily tracking poll averages nationwide put President Obama at 47% and Romney at 46%, according to Gallup. "We have been monitoring the potential impact of the Republican convention on the presidential race on a day-by-day basis," writes Gallup's editor-in-chief Frank Newport. "So far, we don't see an impact." Newport also noted that "both Obama and Romney for the most part have been at or around 46% since we began tracking in April."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346685025703</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:10:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346685101401-17</Id><Title>Gallup poll: absolutely no bounce for Mitt</Title><Msg>why would the republicans put a rich c-riminal to run for office just 4 years after the rich c-riminals almost destroyed this country is beyond me.</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346685101401</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:11:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346685276253-18</Id><Title>have the Republicans defined what a "legitimate" rape is?</Title><Msg>I'm still waiting on an answer to that question</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346685276253</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:14:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346685415283-19</Id><Title>Swiss Bank accounts, outsourced jobs, hired illegals, businesses in Bermuda</Title><Msg>and we know all that from just 2 years of tax returns! release the tax returns Mitt</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346685415283</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:16:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346685574835-20</Id><Title>the rich c-riminals want to buy the presidency just 4 years after the bailout</Title><Msg>they almost destroyed this country 4 years ago, we bailed them out, and now they want to buy the country. just incredible!</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346685574835</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 11:19:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346686530218-21</Id><Title>BREAKING!

Schneiderman, a Democrat, is examining whether the firms have abused a tax strategy to avoid paying hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the probe. The practice involves converting some fees collected for managing accounts into fund investments, resulting in a lower tax rate.

You couldn't pay me to do this again."[33] She later termed the experience "a real education".[25]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346694585198</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 13:49:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346694683649-76</Id><Topic><Title>I AM AN INDEPENDENT FROM OHIO</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346694378552</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 13:46:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dumb ivan is actually a registered independent but a recovering Republican,</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346694683649</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 13:51:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346694699470-77</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt and Anne had to sell stock to pay for college!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346691398337</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 12:56:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>she was busy interviewing illegal help.

Why do you bother posting your jibberish, it's like it comes from childs mouth.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1346719778143</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 20:49:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346720143647-140</Id><Topic><Title>I am MUCH better off today than 4 years ago</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1346696423449</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 14:20:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey dikmouth....getting promotoed to dishwasher does not constitute propserity excepth in the mids of you rowrhtless inept libtard dorks.

Record gasoline prices lasted for pretty much the entire summer 2008 driving season, and in fact probably played a substantial role (one among many) in the severity of the economic crash that followed later that year. And a little history lesson: When Obama took office, the country was in a deep DEPRESSION (not to mention a general near-panic), economic activity had ground almost to a halt, demand for gasoline - and energy inputs generally - had declined precipitously and with unprecedented speed, resulting in a gas price decrease of nearly 60% from peak in just a matter of months. Wow, speaking of your selective SNAPSHOTS!
