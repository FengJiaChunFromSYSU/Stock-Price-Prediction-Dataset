Stacey Campfield Wants to Tie Welfare Benefits to Children's Grades Posted: 30 Jan 2013 03:00 PM PST It looks like "compassionate conservatism" is alive and well in Tennessee: Stacey Campfield, Tennessee GOP Lawmaker, Wants To Tie Welfare Benefits To Children's Grades : Tennessee state Rep. Stacey Campfield (R) introduced a bill this week seeking to make welfare benefits contingent upon the grades of a would-be recipient's children. Campfield's legislation, filed Thursday, would "require the reduction of Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) payments for parents or caretakers of TANF recipients whose children fail to maintain satisfactory progress in school." TANF is more commonly referred to as welfare. Under Campfield's bill, welfare recipients would face a loss of benefits if their children showed poor academic performance. It's unclear how these factors would be tied to one another, or how the children's performance would be assessed. In a blog addressing his proposal, Campfield calls his bill a measure to "break the cycle of poverty." According to Campfield, education is a "three legged stool" comprised of schools, teachers and parents. He claims the state has adequately held the first two legs of the school accountable, but argues that it should apply more pressure on the third. "The third leg of the stool (probably the most important leg) is the parents," Campfield writes. "We have done little to hold them accountable for their child's performance. What my bill would do is put some responsibility on parents for their child's performance."</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359647839902</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:57:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359647854955-45</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like a great Obama today</Title><Username>alfalfa454</Username><Timestamp>1359646701827</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:38:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound pretty naive. The only reason the stock market is up is due to the FED's printing money scheme flooding the market with cheap dollars. Why else do you think gas and food cost has risen so much in the last 3 years. There is still 3 trillion dollars on the sidelines because they know the banks and hedge funds high frequency trading machines comprise 70% of all trades to artificially inflate the stock market. The only companies doing well are muti nationals who are investing overseas - not the US. The smaller companies are getting slammed due to your Obama regulations. Small companies historically hire 70% of workers. Until Obama is out, we will never have normal growth. In 4 more years you will still be iiving with mom and dad blaming Bush for everything. At the end of his next term, Obama's policies will have run up the national debt to a total of 9-10 trillion dollars, as much as all the presidents before him. He will blame it on Bush but the market will not reflect it as small/mid size companies will be stifled due to Obamacare. Get ready for more taxes. Do a little research. This debt he is racking up should scare the heck out of you. Eventually, the piper must be paid an then you will realize what a joke he has been for you.</Msg><Username>mec2invest</Username><Timestamp>1359647854955</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:57:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359647890139-46</Id><Topic><Title>Why is it that Bill Clinton can</Title><Username>alfalfa454</Username><Timestamp>1359647421274</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:50:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why is it no one will accept a cigar from Bill Clinton????

NEOCONS STILL DON'T!</Title><Msg>McCain: Failure to act on immigration could turn red states blue Failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform could have disastrous political consequences for Republicans in red states with growing Hispanic populations, Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, a key player in drafting the blueprint for an immigration overhaul, said Wednesday. "The Republican Party has failed to understand to a significant degree the importance of this issue to our Hispanic voters," McCain said during a breakfast sponsored by Politico. "I think the trend will continue of lack of support from Hispanic voters and also as you look at the demographics of states like mine, that means we will go from Republican to Democrat over time." The bipartisan working group of eight senators on Monday unveiled principles they hope will guide congressional efforts to write a law that offers a path to legality for illegal immigrants in exchange for enhanced border security. The push comes after a national election in which more than 70 percent of Hispanic voters supported Democratic President Barack Obama's re-election over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. The election served as a wake-up call for Republicans, who see the constituency of one of the fastest-growing groups slipping away, and emboldened Democrats, who see it as an opportunity to bring states like Texas and Arizona, which traditionally support Republicans, into their fold. McCain said Republicans currently have a perception problem with Hispanic voters and suggested that working to pass a comprehensive bill could be a major opportunity to re-engage them. "We are elected to office because voters think we will help them achieve their hopes and dreams and aspirations for the future," McCain said. "If you have a large bloc of Americans who believe that you are trying to keep their ... fellow Hispanics down and deprive them of an opportunity, obviously that's going to have an effect."</Msg><Username>oscar_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1359650642882</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 11:44:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359650804855-72</Id><Topic><Title>Cisco Systems, Inc.

Why did Hitler choose his particular style of moustache? An answer may have recently come to light. An unpublished essay, written by another WWI soldier who knew Hitler during this period, wrote that Hitler trimmed his Prussian-style moustache because he was ordered to do so. The wide, somewhat bushy Prussian-style moustache that Hitler had been wearing simply didn't fit under a gas mask. Obama is sporting a pencil thin mustache for his second term.

The Kaufman County assistant district attorney, who reportedly loved guns and often wore a gun belt, was exiting his car when he was approached by two suspects wearing black, Fox 4 in Dallas reported. At least one of them had a tactical vest on, according to the report. The shooting took place in a parking lot in Kaufman where many prosecutors and judges park, the Dallas Morning News reported. The victim was struck by all five shots, according to Fox 4. "My secretary heard the gunshots," Kaufman defense lawyer Eric Smenner told the newspaper. With the suspects still on the loose, police locked down the immediate area. The school district also locked down local schools as a precaution. The victim's name has not yet been released, but state records show he was certified as a peace officer 25 years ago, according to the Dallas Morning News. He almost always carried a gun, friends told the newspaper. “He was revered and he did an outstanding job,” Kaufman County Judge Bruce Wood told the Morning News. “We see each other every day. … It’s a very small courthouse.”</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359655745628</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 13:09:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359655764375-119</Id><Topic><Title>ANTI-ISRAEL CHUCKIE HAGEL BEING CRUCIFIED IN</Title><Username>wildwoolywabbit</Username><Timestamp>1359655609473</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 13:06:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He'll be another Obama lacky if confirmed.

I'd like to introduce myself to all of you on the yahoo Stinger Message Board. I am Oscar Dimwitty. Now those of you with limited trading abilities are looking at yourselves about now and asking"Who is Oscar Dimwitty?" and thats ok because in a few months you will all know who Oscar Dimwitty is. I only appear on stock message boards right before a stock is about ready to take off. Look up my last 2 plays 1) WWAT it went from 0.14 to $2.52 and has now consolidated at $1.84. It will be trading at @ $3 in the 1st Q of 2008. 2) AVNR (avanir) I arrived there to post at @ $1.26 and within a month it went to @ $4.00. Can't tell you details but this here beaten down 0.19 Stinger is going to have its day in the sun real soon and those lucky enough to have loaded up here will be able to apply to the STIY Millionaire Club which I am now currently the President of. This is no hype,I'm selling you nothing,hey you're already here so all you have to do is hold and wait (the latest spring training) and you will be holding a $5 plus stock. Remember this day and who I am and you will shortly become a member of the Oscar Dimwitty fan club. My record speaks for itself. My wife Gertie and my son Pugsly and my daughter Little Edna are set for life loading up on WWAT and you could be too just by staying with Stinger. I don't post on many stocks (maybe 2-3 a year) and I had only one loser LJPC which will eventually shoot higher when Riquent gets its FDA approval, Anyways I'm sure I'll receive some bashing here by those who are skeptical of everything. I have received many bashings each and every time I move to a new stock. My old uncle Ned used to tell me sticks and stones will break your bones but names will never hurt you. That was right before a gang carrying sticks and stones attacked Uncle Ned killing him. Anyways thats a story for a different time. This is Oscar Dimwitty the STIY Millionaire Club President hoping you all soon will join me. Signing off..

Joey Paul, 29, was charged with second-degree murder, second-degree manslaughter and second-degree criminal possession of a weapon charges, according to information from the Saratoga County District Attorney's office Wednesday. Paul has been accused of shooting Matthew Furlani, 28, with a rifle at point-blank range in the Church Street apartment they lived. When state troopers arrived that Sunday morning, they found Furlani dead. Paul was the only other person inside the home, District Attorney James A. Murphy III said at the time.

Jeremy is now resting at the hospital and is not seeing visitors. Earlier: Ron Jeremy is fighting for his life at a Los Angeles hospital and is being treated for an aneurysm near his heart. The world's most celebrated porn star drove himself to Cedars-Sinai hospital on Tuesday after experiencing severe chest pain, TMZ reports. His manager, Mike Esterman, told the site that his condition has worsened after doctors discovered the aneurysm and he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Jeremy, 59, was being prepped for surgery this morning. It's yet unclear what led to the chest pain. The adult film actor, who has starred in more than 2,000 films -- pornography and non-porno -- has been an outspoken opponent of the new law in Los Angeles that would require adult film actors to wear condoms while filming . He campaigned against Measure B in the weeks before the election. He was also reportedly recruited last year to help catch Luka Magnotta, the alleged porn-star-gone-Canadian cannibal.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359660379660</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:26:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359660555710-181</Id><Title>The CISCO yo-yo</Title><Msg>The MMs are at it again.

Got nothing to do with Israel.</Title><Msg>In 2012, Hagel co-wrote an opinion piece with a bipartisan group of former congressmen and military leaders on stopping Iran from getting a nuclear bomb. It said, "our position is fully consistent with the policy of presidents for more than a decade of keeping all options on the table, including the use of military force, thereby increasing pressure on Iran while working toward a political solution." This policy is common sense, consistent with that of both President Bush and Obama, and entirely within the mainstream. And yet, the accusation that Hagel is out of the mainstream on Iran and Israel percolates because it is in the talking points. An early broadside came from The Weekly Standard, which published an anonymous e-mail, allegedly from a Senate aide, reading, "Send us Hagel and we will make sure every American knows he is an anti-Semite." This is a serious accusation and a transparent attempt to intimidate. Anti-Semitism is a rightfully toxic charge. Israel is America's closest ally in the world, along with the UK. But in a recent interview with his hometown paper in Lincoln, Nebraska, Hagel said that his record demonstrates "unequivocal, total support for Israel." In his memoir, Hagel devotes an entire chapter to "The Holy Land: Israel and The Arabs," full of calls for negotiated peace with statements like this: "There is one important given that is not negotiable: A comprehensive solution should not include any compromise regarding Israel's Jewish identity, which must be assured. The Israeli people must be free to live in peace and security." For what it's worth, five former ambassadors to Israel have endorsed Hagel's nomination, and former Israeli Consul Gen. Alon Pinkas has clarified that Hagel is "not anti-Israel."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359661089579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:38:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359661119116-186</Id><Title>Guess where the Obama Library will be erected</Title><Msg>Little-Known Reagan Home To Be Spitefully Razed For Obama Library, Say Conservatives January 30th, 2013 5:57 pm @LaurieInQueens In what could be the most desperate right-wing attempt to manufacture an Obama-related scandal we’ve witnessed in some time—quickly eclipsing the “uppity” First Lady’s inauguration day eyeroll that was felt around the world—conservatives have worked themselves into a self-righteous lather over a building where Saint Ronnie once lived. For a year. As a three-year-old. Yes, the latest wingnut conspiracy has it that a University of Chicago-owned apartment building that briefly housed Ronald Reagan as a toddler will soon be torn down—paving paradise to put up a parking lot—and one day turned into Barack Obama’s presidential library. All to spite conservatives. The Washington Times, that bastion of impartiality, sets the tone by asking, “Is it politically motivated? Is Mayor Rahm Emanuel behind the move?” and then provides us with a comically melodramatic overdramatization of just how important that fleeting year in a Chicago apartment was in transforming wee Ronnie into the fearless defender of conservatism we all knew and loathed: Young Reagan would watch the horse-drawn fire engines galloping wildly down the streets to save the day and he decided that he, too, would become a firefighter. It was here, too, that he survived a bout with pneumonia – he had the fight in him even then. You can almost imagine him skipping down these streets, playing with his brother Neil, whose nickname was “Moon.” What makes a man great? And what makes a great president? Historians pen large tomes about that. Every man is the sum of his experiences – his loves, his losses, his achievements, and failures. How he sees the world and how the world sees him. And this place – this place was a part of Reagan’s formative years – what he discovered and experienced here in Chicago helped him on the way to greatness. And lest we not realize at once that OMG, there is totally a conspiracy here, people!! the Times ominously reminds us: First Lady Michelle Obama and the president’s close advisor Valerie Jarrett are former top executives of the University of Chicago Medical Center. President Obama was a lecturer at the law school for twelve years. And let’s not forget, Obama’s Hyde Park home is here too. This is still Chicago. Barack Obama’s Chicago. Rahm Emanuel’s Chicago. It is safe to say that Democrats don’t want any reminders of a Republican president named Reagan and his glory days a stone’s throw from a future Obama Presidential Library. (Because, um, Ronald Reagan’s “glory days” were between the ages of three and four?! You said it, not us.) The Chicago Sun-Times is a bit more… sane in its depiction of the building’s actual place in history, explaining that Reagan “spent just a year at the home as a 3-to-4 year-old from 1914 to 1915,” and pointing out that “the university’s controversial new Milton Friedman Institute — named in tribute to the architect of Reagan’s free market policies — is just a few blocks away from the former Reagan home.” You know, because Obama and his “Chicago thugs” have made the Windy City unsafe for conservatives. And in another nod to reality sure to rile the Reaganites, the Sun-Times adds this little nugget: Ironically, if Reagan’s father had not enjoyed his booze a little too much, the home’s presidential history might have been lost long ago. Park Ridge resident Tom Roeser, 82, discovered the link in the early 1980s when he pressed Reagan for details of the home during a visit to the White House. Reagan couldn’t remember the address, but passed on a message: “My father was picked up often as a common drunk — the police records police records should have that fact.” Reagan’s dad being arrested for public drunkenness is one thing, but Ronnie, it seems, couldn’t even remember the address of the building they’re frothing over, the place that so completely shaped him as a person and leader. Which makes sense. Because he only lived there for a year. When he was three.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359661119116</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:38:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359661297566-187</Id><Topic><Title>Guess where the Obama Library will be erected</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359661119116</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:38:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They puting in GAYLAND!</Msg><Username>shwdl</Username><Timestamp>1359661297566</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:41:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359661504536-188</Id><Topic><Title>Oh Yooooo-Hooooo!

Virtually every state in the union takes a greater share of income from working families than the rich, according to a new report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP). The report’s stark conclusion finds that state and local tax rates are “fundamentally unfair,” creating a hindrance to economic growth for the middle class that has been exacerbated by states moving away from progressive income taxes and toward consumption taxes. “There’s a good chance it’s the so-called ‘takers’ who spend so much on necessities that they pay an effective tax rate of 10 or more percent, due largely to sales and property taxes,” Matthew Gardner, executive director of ITEP and an author of the study, said. Texas, which is often called the “low tax state,” ranks among the states that have the highest taxes on the poor. The bottom 20 percent pays 6 times the rate of the richest in Washington State, Florida, South Dakota, Illinois, Texas, Tennessee, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Alabama. ITEP called these states the “Terrible Ten” Most Regressive States. Deductions and the practice of taxing capital gains at a lower rate make state tax codes more regressive. Policies like the earned income tax credit, which Michigan Republicans just cut, make the code more progressive, but only exist in 24 states and the District of Columbia. Even where states do have progressive income tax rates, they’re effectively shaped to put the burden on working families. “Alabama is a good example of a state with nominally graduated income tax rates that don’t mean much in practice,” the report states. “The state’s top tax rate of 5 percent is not much lower than Louisiana’s top rate — but the top rate kicks in at just $6,000 of taxable income for married couples. ” This is the fourth such study from ITEP and it includes a comprehensive study of state and local tax rates (PDF</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359661751787</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:49:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359661951689-192</Id><Topic><Title>Face it the GOP hates Hagel because he was right on Iraq and they were wrong.

The nation’s largest gun seller has faced criticism for refusing to stop selling semi-automatic assault rifles following the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, where a disturbed young man killed 27 people and then himself, including 20 children, with a Bushmaster AR-15. The company was sold out of semi-automatic assault rifles in five states immediately following the Newtown massacre in December, reports said. Although it refused to stop selling the guns, it did remove a photo of a Bushmaster M4A3 from its website. Purchasing guns and ammo at Walmart poses no problem for consumers. The same cannot be said for the following products which have all been banned from Walmart stores. ■pregnant Barbie dolls ■Jon Stewart’s book America ■Sheryl Crow’s debut album (Walmart disapproved of the lyrics to one of the songs) ■the DVD documentary Uncovered: The Whole Truth About The Iraq War The more I find out about Walmart, it’s polices, business practices and treatment of employees, the easier it is to stay firm with my commitment to never again set foot in one of their stores.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359662260736</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:57:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359662308758-197</Id><Title>Laura Bush killed the wrong Boyfriend</Title><Msg>Bushs are crazy</Msg><Username>buddhazenpeace</Username><Timestamp>1359662308758</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:58:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359662333995-198</Id><Topic><Title>Guess where the Obama Library will be erected</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1359661119116</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:38:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jakarta...next to his statue.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1359662333995</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 14:58:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359662415082-199</Id><Topic><Title>I'm the puppet master</Title><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1359647498267</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:51:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yup,did it again!!!

The main directive of the minority party is to influence public policy, not control it. The Republicans might have to steal the democratic priorities and use blaming and mudslinging instead of their intellect and ability to frame the issues. It is my hope that they will minimize the effect of the extreme right evangelicals, and accept the current conditions of social reality, ie. abandon their focus on abortion and gay marriage. I left the party for that very reason. I believe in the concept of live and let die.

Police said the shooting took place shortly before 2 p.m. when a student fired several rounds in the courtyard of Price Middle School, a newer school southeast of downtown Atlanta. Live video from NBC station WXIA-TV showed police, emergency vehicles and an ambulance swarming the area as crowd of anxious parents flooded toward the school. Police said the wounded boy was taken "alert, conscious and breathing" to the hospital. WXIA, citing school district and fire department officials, reported that he was shot in back of the neck. The wound was not considered life threatening. The teacher suffered cuts and bruises during the panic of the incident, police said. A student at the school was in custody, police said. Atlanta Police Chief George Turner said a resource officer at the school, an armed off-duty Atlanta officer, was able to disarm the suspect shortly after the shooting. Walker, who said her daughter is an eighth-grader at the school, told The Associated Press that she received a text from her daughter about the shooting. "Ma, somebody's shooting and somebody got shot." Walker said. She jumped into her car and was thinking "just hurry up and get there." The school was placed in lockdown, and all other students were safe, school officials said. Students were kept at the school for hours, but were reunited with their parents by about 5 p.m. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said in a statement that he is very concerned about the incident and gun violence. "Gun violence in and around our schools is simply unconscionable and must end," Reed said. "Too many young people are being harmed and too many families are suffering from unimaginable and unnecessary grief. I pray that the student who was shot today at Price Middle School in southwest Atlanta recovers quickly and can return home to family and friends." Atlanta Public Schools Superintendent Erroll Davis said the school has metal detectors and officials were still trying to determine how the gun got on campus</Msg><Username>alfalfa454</Username><Timestamp>1359681087458</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 20:11:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359681241257-298</Id><Title>nobody in Israel when Jesus was there was caucasian, HELLO ALL THE CAUCASIANS WERE IN NORTHERN EUROPE, lol</Title><Msg>Now, let us examine the facts: Firstly, the bible along with other archeological evidence substantiates the fact that the original Israelites were very dark skinned (Black) people. All of the nations descended from Noah. According to the tenth chapter of Genesis, Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. If you look around the earth, you will see that the majority of the nations are dark brown people. One must conclude that their father Noah had to be a very dark skinned man with woolly hair! It is impossible for light-skinned Caucasian parents to produce dark skinned children. Therefore, Noah and his family were all people of color. The Israelites come out of the lineage of Noah's son Shem. Contrary to what has been taught, the so called blacks in America and throughout the Caribbean are Shemetic. They are not Hametic. According to the Bible, the Israelites as a nation came out of Egypt, not Europe. Jacob was the father of the twelve tribes of Israel. Jacob went into Egypt with his twelve sons. His son Joseph was already living there and had a good position working under the Pharaoh of Egypt. Among the Egyptians in Africa, the sons of Israel multiplied and became the twelve tribes of Israel. Genesis 46 verses 26 to 34: "All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were threescore and six; &amp;lt;27&amp;gt; And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten. &amp;lt;28&amp;gt; And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. &amp;lt;29&amp;gt; And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while." It is a well-known fact that before the Greeks, Romans, Europeans, and Arabs went into Egypt to colonize, rape and evict the original Egyptians, the inhabitants were all dark-skinned Africans. In the tombs of Egypt, what color are the Egyptians and the Hebrews depicted as? They are shown to be different shades of brown, not with blond hair and blue eyes! This is one of many archeological proofs! Herodotus, an ancient historian, described exactly what the ancient Egyptians looked like, which he witnessed with his own eyes. Herodotus, who visited Egypt about 457 BC, states in his Historical studies that: "The Nubians, the Egyptians, and the Ethiopians have broad noses, thick lips, woolly hair, And they are burnt of skin." The dark color of the Egyptians is an important fact, because you must consider the case of Moses, a Hebrew Israelite who was adopted by and concealed within the court of the pharaoh. If Moses were a Caucasian it would have been impossible to conceal his race in the presence of dark Egyptians! At first glance, Moses was even called an Egyptian, as recorded in the Bible: Exodus 2 verse 19:</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359681241257</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 20:14:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359681305245-299</Id><Topic><Title>Isn't it ironic</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1359673750180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 18:09:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>St. Augustine was black; Saint Augustine believed that abortion of a fetus animatus, a fetus with human limbs and shape, was murder. In ancient Rome "race" (as we think of it today) wasn't typically something of particular note. What we do know is that Augustine's mother was certainly native African, and his father might have been, but his father was definitely more "Roman" in cultural (if not ethnic) heritage. The written evidence of abortion reflects the interests of class and caste. Fines are listed in the Code of Hammurabi, ca. 1760 BC, for the crime of causing a miscarriage through assault, with the amount varying according to the social rank of the woman. The only evidence of the death penalty being mandated for abortion in the ancient laws is found in Assyrian Law, in the Code of Assura, c. 1075 BCE; and this is only imposed on a woman who procures an abortion against her husband's wishes. It's genetic cleansing.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1359681305245</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 20:15:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359681424565-300</Id><Topic><Title>Menendez problems grow</Title><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1359655591978</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 13:06:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now coming out that Bill Clinton has stayed at the dentist's mansion in the Dominican Republic.

It's an "honor by association" gambit. The true disciple wouldn't care who spoke the words. He would derive meaning from what they say. I suggest that Paul was not a true disciple because he misinterpreted Jesus's best metaphor. The bread is the words which Jesus gave. The wine is their meaning.
