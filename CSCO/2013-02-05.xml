People talk about political discourse in this country — you might think what I said was tasteless, you’re welcome to. But should I get death threats as a result of it?” Kincannon tweeted on Sunday night: “This Super Bowl sucks more #$%$ than adult Trayvon Martin would have for drug money.” Later, during a power outage, he added: “It hasn’t been this dark in the Superdome since all those poors occupied it after Hurricane Katrina.” tea billies are #$%$, the GOP can't figure out why the country is turning against conservatives. They think out right racism is a defendable position.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1360069884929</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 08:11:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360070169880-5</Id><Title>Obama Gas was $1.73 when he took office and now it is $3.69.

Obama promised to end earmarks. Obama promised to make peace with direct, no precondition talks with Americas most hate-filled enemies during his first year in office, ushering in a new era of global cooperation.

The white paper suggests that such decisions would not be subject to judicial review and outlines a broad definition of what constitutes “imminent” threat. Constitutional experts said the memo's definition doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. Administration critics immediately said the white paper is fresh evidence the president has abandoned his 2008 campaign pledge to recognize and respect the limits of executive power.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1360075119678</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 09:38:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360075140807-16</Id><Topic><Title>Fooling the public</Title><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1360074581623</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 09:29:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who ever staged this propaganda photo has never been skeetshooting. *** Administration propaganda exposed!</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1360075140807</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 09:39:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360075193677-17</Id><Topic><Title>Ever since ROMNEY LOST- "O'Reilly" factor regularly has African-American Guests- Jessie Jackson, Colin Powell</Title><Username>oscar_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1360074552610</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 09:29:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Oscar Magoo, Here's a tip about FOXNEWS.

But it's not going to strike us, when it passes by on February 15. But it will give the Blue Planet the closest shave by any object its size in known history, Yeomans said. Gravity will cause it to fly a curved path, tugging it closer to Earth's surface than most GPS or television satellites. What the he&amp;ll!?! Razor burn. 2012 DA14 is likely made of stone.

The wine is the meaning of his words, which is the spirit of the words he spoke. We don't gain any ultimate truth unless we work diligently. The belief that there is an afterlife or a God cannot be proven. What can be proven is the psychological benefit of belief.

The simplest cure for lost loved ones is belief.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1360096396759</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:33:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360096409457-141</Id><Topic><Title>IS OBAMA THE BIBLICAL "BEAST" AKA THE ANTICHRIST?</Title><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1360086436043</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 12:47:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"So now the pot and kettle are in agreement? Religion can be viewed as childish without putting a but(t)hurt on other people?" I don't know how you got that I was "agreeing" with you. I was pointing out the inconsistency of what you said before and how such beliefs are childish. Not at all, no follower of a belief system sees it as childish, in fact they see it as the mature thing to do. My point is that YOU do believe in the supernatural when it suits you. So don't refer to other's beliefs as childish. To do so therefore only undermines your own beliefs.</Msg><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1360096409457</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:33:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360096582462-142</Id><Topic><Title>IS OBAMA THE BIBLICAL "BEAST" AKA THE ANTICHRIST?</Title><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1360086436043</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 12:47:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Without belief, there is weeping an gnashing of teeth.

The belief in an "afterlife" actually has been "proven". Jesus Himself is living evidence of that, and over 500 witnesses to the resurrected Christ also attest to it (1 Cornthians 15:6). If over 500 people testify to a fact, that is a fact that would stand up in any court of law. Also, merely "believing" something in and of itself neither validates it or invalidates it. You describe a placebo effect as if people have been duped. In reality, perhaps it is you who have been duped by lying spirits, from a source that has nothing to do with God, that teaches another path of salvation outside of faith in His Son, His method of salvation, Jesus Christ.</Msg><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1360097198389</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:46:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360097423411-152</Id><Topic><Title>Mel Brooks did a great job making fun of gay boys in his movies -</Title><Username>orenthal_james_obama</Username><Timestamp>1360096737213</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:38:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ever see the original "The Producers"? *** Springtime for Hitler -- we looked around the man for you and me.

Not so arbitrary. If Jesus is truth, as he claimed, then his blood would be the meaning of the words which lead to truth. He claimed to be truth, which is a symbolic reference of himself. How does one attempt to communicate truth, but through his words? How does one retain the meaning after one dies? If Philosophy is too deep for you, you can always stick with religion.

Of course you would see it that way, because you don't "see" my beliefs, you only "assume" you know what I believe. Your vision is corrupted by the log in your eye. You can believe that a few people have seen the afterlife, but only those you designate. To me, that sounds like a very selfish viewpoint, and it is the most common aspect of most religious viewpoints. They believe that their prophets are the only true prophets. I would think even your Jesus would have trouble convincing you that you can talk to spirits as could he, yet there you pray for it on Sunday as if the minister somehow had a special bond to channel your prayers. You believe in the interpretations you were provided, and no openess to the possibility that your teachers have been corrupted, even though your Jesus specifically warned you against pharisees and wolves in the fold. One might consider the possibility that a pharisee or wolf led the flock wrongly long before your minister was even born. One might even note that Paul was, in fact, a pharisee.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1360099175684</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 16:19:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360099498340-161</Id><Topic><Title>It's easy to tell that Surfandfag, Dumb Ivanfag, and Juniorfagmate are the same</Title><Username>orenthal_james_obama</Username><Timestamp>1360096376764</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:32:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'Surfnfag'.

Cherry picking what you like from this and that philosophy or religion. Only to end up with a confusing mass of contradictory thoughts (they really aren't "beliefs" because you surrender and exchange them for "better" ones on a moment's notice). You constantly interpret the Bible out of context because you don't know the Bible well, just enough to quote it when it suits you and to make you look childish. You like to communicate with "spirits" and apparently believe in "channeling", conversing with the spirits of the dead to gain information, but the Bible forbids doing so, for these are of an occult nature and most usually demonic beings. I would warn you not to do so, you may have already opened yourself up to demonic possession, or could in the future. I have no quoted any "teachers" of mine, so I have no idea what you refer to, but even if I had refered to a "teacher" of some kind, why would you assume that the person was a false teacher.

I clearly stated that my beliefs are Shamanic, and I believe in an afterlife. Outside of that, I said believe that Jesus was a medicine man. I would say that I also believe that most of his magic and medicine were philosophical and psychological. After his poignant remarks, he usually said; "For those have ears to hear" Hearing his words is all one needs to begin a quest for righteousness and truth. Actually "hearing" them, not just pretending to know what they mean. Do you actually think that he meant that you should pluck your eyes out? It was a symbolic message of absurdity. The eyes do not cause a man to sin. Pluck your heart out.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1360101581467</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 16:59:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360101797213-178</Id><Topic><Title>Eddie Ray Routh, Suspect In Chris Kyle Murder, Has Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Police</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1360100582094</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 16:43:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you enjoy the death of a really good American so much??</Msg><Username>crankf41</Username><Timestamp>1360101797213</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 17:03:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360101869339-179</Id><Topic><Title>MAXIPADS I WILL SCHOOL YOU AGAIN, THIS TIME ON THE ANTICHRIST...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1360099011112</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 16:16:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The title 'Nero Ceasar' in Greek, when translated to hebrew has the numerological value 666.

Scientists calculated the Tunguska explosion could have been roughly as strong as 10 megatons to 20 megatons of TNT -- 1,000 times more powerful than the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The longstanding theory regarding the cause of the event is a cosmic impact from an asteroid or comet. In the last decade, researchers have conjectured the event was triggered by an asteroid exploding in Earth's atmosphere and measuring roughly 100 feet wide (30 meters) and 617,300 tons (560,000 metric tons) in mass -- more than 10 times that of the Titanic. DA14 is 131 feet in diameter (40 meters.) Great timing to coincide with North Korean nuke test.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1360110279445</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 19:24:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360111071453-215</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like Oracle Is Coming After Cisco</Title><Username>porkypiggins</Username><Timestamp>1360109930822</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 19:18:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dash for Trash.

The sole purpose of your existence is to make money for democrat rulers and keep then in power.</Msg><Username>citizens_against_toxic_waste</Username><Timestamp>1360122594025</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:49:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360123437328-240</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S COMMUNISM LEADS TO EVENTUAL SLAVERY FOR ALL EXCEPT FOR DEMOCRAT POLITICANS</Title><Username>son_of_sam_was_a_democrat</Username><Timestamp>1360122162579</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:42:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least they give us iPhones and don't beat us too hard.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1360123437328</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 23:03:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360123595528-241</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S COMMUNISM LEADS TO EVENTUAL SLAVERY FOR ALL EXCEPT FOR DEMOCRAT POLITICANS</Title><Username>son_of_sam_was_a_democrat</Username><Timestamp>1360122162579</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:42:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The difference between slavery and communism is you get to choose whether to spend your food stamps on beer.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1360123595528</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 23:06:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
