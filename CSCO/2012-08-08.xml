"President Obama's answer to our economic crisis was more spending, more debt and larger government. And by the end of his term in office he will have added nearly as much public debt as all the prior presidents combined," Romney said in an April 4, 2012, speech to newspaper editors. "No president has ever run a trillion-dollar deficit. The new normal the president would have us embrace is trillion-dollar deficits and 8 percent unemployment. Through all of this, President Obama has failed to even pass a budget." There are a lot of accusations packed in there, but that last one -- that Obama failed to pass a budget -- piqued our interest most. How the budget happens The federal budget doesn’t get enacted the way other laws do. The process starts with the president submitting his budget request to Congress early in the year. That voluminous document is partly a presidential wish list, but it also gives Congress a framework. "The ‘PresBud,’ as it is called, forms the basis of the fiscal year budget that starts the following October," according to this post from the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. In Congress, the House and Senate have budget committees tasked with creating concurrent budget resolutions, using the president’s budget as a guide. As Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote, "The legislation they draft is for Congressional use only: it doesn't go to the President, it isn't law, it just helps Congress keep its budgetary ducks in a row." So there is the first problem with Romney’s statement. The president doesn’t "pass" a budget. That’s Congress’ job. In Obama’s case, he has submitted his budget request each year he has been in office. get to congress every yr he's been in office:</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1344424467896</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 07:14:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344425059514-6</Id><Topic><Title>Are you better off today than 4 years ago?</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344421464229</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 06:24:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Virtual, The market has NOT doubled since Obama took office, S &amp; P was 860 in Jan. 2009.

The poll comes as Obama heads to Colorado on Wednesday to hold two campaign events. It suggests he has some work to do to convince voters that he should be re-elected. And the most glaring evidence of that is this damning number: 51 percent of Colorado voters think his economic policies will never improve the economy. That means there's little hope that Obama will ever turn around the economy Looks like same thing in North Carolina where Obama also won in 2008.

Obamacare is itself a 2 trillion dollar tax hike, and when your boss drops paying for your healthcare, your going to have to pick it up personally. The Bush tax cuts is at least a $3000 per person tax hike per year. Almost everyone in the middle class got part of the Bush tax cut. Letting it expire as Obama says he will not sign its extension will be the biggest tax hike ever. I don't understand why when Obama had that total control for two years of the congress that he didn't substitute something he wanted instead of the Bush tax cut? Well be that the biggest mystery about Obama economics, nobody can blame all these hikes on the GOP who are against these hugh tax increases. Just the fact that Romney is against these two programs means that taxes won't go up.

The 2012 Survey of Affluence and Wealth in America, from American Express Publishing and Harrison Group, finds that One Percenters are hoarding three times as much cash as they were two years ago. Their savings rate soared to 34 percent in the second quarter of 2012, up from 12 percent in 2007. Higher savings would normally be good for the economy. But not now, when capital is needed to invest in growth and jobs. The One Percenters put 56 percent of their available cash into savings accounts and money markets in 2012 – that’s up from 24 percent in 2007. They’re investing just 44 percent in financial markets – down from 76 percent in 2007. More One Percenters say the stock market is “a real risk” rather than a “real opportunity.” That’s a big switch from just last year, when 62 percent said the market was an opportunity. In other words, One Percenters used to save less, and invest more. Now they’re “basically stuffing money under the mattress,” said Jim Taylor, vice chairman of Harrison Group</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344470593939</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 20:03:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344470921057-46</Id><Title>INCINERATE TEXAS, JUST NUKE IT !</Title><Msg>Texas slapped the U.S. Supreme Court in the face, and the justices just took it. On Tuesday night, Texas executed Marvin Wilson, whose IQ score was 61 -- low enough that it should have met any standard for "diminished mental capacity." Shockingly, the court did not intervene to stop the execution despite its 2002 decision in Atkins v. Virginia barring the execution of the "mentally retarded" as "cruel and unusual punishment" in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Wilson played a role in the murder of Jerry Williams in 1992. He needed to be held accountable for his actions, even with diminished mental capacity. But he had the mental capacity of a first-grader, could barely match his socks and was fired from a car wash job for being too slow at drying cars. A clinical neuropsychologist with 22 years of experience concluded Wilson was intellectually disabled. Texas got away with executing an intellectually disabled person because the Supreme Court allows states to determine their own standards of "mental retardation" and hasn't bothered to push back when states clearly ignore its ruling. Laura Moye Flouting the heart of the Atkins decision, Texas decided that not all persons with "mental retardation" should be barred from execution, just those who "a consensus of Texas citizens would agree" whether they should live or die.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344470921057</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 20:08:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344471254222-47</Id><Topic><Title>INCINERATE TEXAS, JUST NUKE IT !</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1344470921057</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 20:08:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thought you took a couple of your boyfriends to your cabin in Beaver Creek to play hide the weenie for a couple of weeks??

Just compare it to Oracle and you'll be amazed how cheap Cisco trades at. Hmm, or maybe Oracle is way overvalued? On any rate, currently, Cisco is in a trading range: $14.50 - $17.50 but if it trades above $18 next week after the earnings, you can kiss that trading range goodbye. Big IF, and we shall see about that... My guess is that Chambers will double down on politics next week and the share price will stay in its trading range. Chambers has used Cisco as his personal piggy bank for decades and, incredibly, he is allowed to continue that behavior today. For sure, accumulating cheap shares ahead of his retirement is part of his game plan. Personally, I can make more money if Cisco stays in the trading range. So, I'm biased, and I can't wait to see what Chambers will come up with next! I hope he brings back the "air-pockets" speech. I'm definitely ready for that one.

The CBO estimates that in 2022--8 years after the Affordable Care Act has been fully implemented--30 million people will remain uninsured. Moreover, under Obamacare, 8 percent of legal U.S. residents will remain without health insurance in 2022, according to CBO. The report was done to #$%$ the fiscal impact of the Supreme Court June Obamacare decision. “CBO and JCT [Joint Committee on Taxation] now estimate that the ACA, in comparison with prior law before the enactment of the ACA, will reduce the number of nonelderly people without health insurance coverage by 14 million in 2014 and by 29 million or 30 million in the latter part of the coming decade, leaving 30 million nonelderly residents uninsured by the end of the period,” the report said. “Before the Supreme Court’s decision, the latter number had been 27 million,” states the report. As a result of the Supreme Court decision, states are no longer obligated under Obamacare to expand eligibility for their Medicaid programs. “Some states will probably forgo the expansion entirely; some are likely to expand coverage to everyone whose income is below 138 percent of the FPL [federal poverty level]; and if the flexibility is allowed, some states may choose partial expansions. Further, states may be able to make those choices in any year after 2014,” the report said. “The updated estimates by CBO and JCT represent their #$%$ment of the middle of the distribution of the many possible outcomes arising from the Supreme Court’s decision,” states the CBO report. On the same day the Supreme Court issued its ruling, President Barack Obama delivered a speech in which he said 30 million Americans presently without health coverage will now have the opportunity to obtain affordable health plans. “If you’re one of the 30 million Americans who don’t yet have health insurance, starting in 2014, this law will offer you an array of quality, affordable, private health insurance plans to choose from,” said Obama. However, as the CBO concludes, despite all the new government regulations and bureaucracies, taxes and subsidies created by Obamacare, there will still be 30 million uninsured people in the United States a decade from now.</Msg><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1344476616646</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:43:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344476667569-70</Id><Topic><Title>CBO says Obamacare once implemented will still leave 30 million uninsured.</Title><Username>miter_banisdirti</Username><Timestamp>1344476616646</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:43:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When they passed this nightmare of a law, there were 16 million without insurance. Some were elgible for Medicare, or Medicaid or had employer insurance but had not signed up for it. Now supposedly there will be 30 million without insurance. How many of these are people whose employer would rather pay a penalty instead of insurance? Why are we counting illegals in these numbers? Oh I forgot, they are covered under Obamacare even though he said they wouldn't be. However, it is in the law. I read it. In fact, young illegals will be given medical care, when it will be rationed or flat out denied to legal Senior citizens.

You pick 2 months out of 3 1/2 years and you draw a conclusion from that? There are a little more than 1 million LESS Americans working today than when Obama took office. The UE rate has NEVER gotten below what the rate was when he too office. That is an utter and complete FAILURE. When you make those comments it makes you look silly. By the way, those 750K lost jobs per month were ALSO coming under a 2 year reign of a Democratic congress. PLenty of blame to go around, seems you people conveniently forget ALL the facts.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1344478384457</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 22:13:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344478469118-77</Id><Topic><Title>Fox says the rich will leave the country if taxed too much</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344477094298</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:51:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you omitted the smiley face</Msg><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344478469118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 22:14:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344481819028-78</Id><Title>Texas. ...Amazing state!!! ....RICH AND FRIENDLY</Title><Msg>Happy to give you a break...eager to help those who help themselves JUST don't murder anyone in Texas.
