Or perhaps Nathan Sproul and other senior executive officers of Strategic Allied Consulting, which was (until very recently) central to the RNC's voter registration and GOTV(GTFO) effort? From Florida's Daytona Times: "Sproul and his companies, which have been directly linked to voter suppression, trickery and fraud, have actually been paid more than $21.2 million by the Republican Party over the past nine years." From the UK Guardian: "Sometime in or shortly before January 2010 ... Romney registered to vote in Massachusetts, stating on his voter registration form that he lived in his son Tagg's basement at 18 Greensbrook Way. In January 2010, Romney voted in Massachusetts' special election, which would be a felony if he was not a Massachusetts resident at the time." -- REPOST -- Re: Ya'all remember those Latino voters? 4 second(s) ago Voter fraud HAS been documented to occur, albeit at a rate of between 0.0002% and 0.0008%, i.e. BETWEEN TWO AND EIGHT TIMES PER MILLION VOTES CAST.* Clearly a pandemic. Meanwhile, "solutions" proposed by ReptiliCONs to address this almost-but-not-quite-entirely-nonexistent problem would effectively disenfranchise hundreds of thousands (and perhaps millions) of voters, with a disparate impact on minorities, the poor, students and the elderly. ---------------- * Presumably these totals include (i) RepubliCON Indiana Attorney General Charlie White (recently convicted of SIX felony counts, THREE of which were for voter fraud), and (ii) noted equine RepubliCON transexual Ann Coulter, who is apparently still clopping around the meadow free as of this writing. * * * * * -- REPOST -- Re: Ya'all remember those Latino voters? 5 second(s) ago Less than 1 in 100,000, LIAR Fruitbat. That's even INCLUDING ReptiliCONs Charlie White and Ann "Buttercup" Coulter.

VP Joe Biden is out gaffe-making again. The president goes on Jon Stewart’s Daily Show and says, “When four Americans get killed, it’s not optimal.” (Oh. My. Goodness.) He is falling behind in state and national polls. So is it time for Democrats to panic? Well, many signs point that way. Mitt Romney is now leading President Obama nationally in the RealClearPolitics average. He is over 50 percent in Gallup. No candidate over 50 percent in Gallup this late in the race has lost. His favorability rating (favorable to unfavorable) is higher than Obama’s. In electoral votes, when you average recent polling, he leads 206 to 201. Romney’s team is “done” ( i.e. feels it has comfortably) with North Carolina. Although polling is still mixed, the Romney team believes it is ahead in Colorado, Virginia and Florida. If you are counting electoral votes that puts Romney’s total up to 257. A win in either Ohio or Pennsylvania would put Romney over 270. Alternatively, if he grabs New Hampshire and Iowa, plus either Nevada or Wisconsin, he’ll win the race. What Obama needs is a game-changer, something to jolt the race and knock Romney off his glide path. The debate could do it if Romney makes a horrid gaffe. But short of that, is there anything else? It is hard to think of something, jokes about “Wag the Dog” and October Surprises aside. Right now it is Team Obama that is making the gaffes and mistakes, resorting to trivia and grousing about polls. In short, it is not the current gap but the momentum in the race and the campaigns’ relative performances that suggest to Democrats that, yes indeed, it just might be time to panic</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350655581315</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 10:06:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350655625251-51</Id><Topic><Title>Latest Fox News Poll Shows Romney Winning All 50 States and 157% of the Vote</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1350652843265</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 09:20:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sssss</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1350655625251</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 10:07:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350655738464-52</Id><Topic><Title>LOOKS LIKE ROMNEYS 15MINS OF DEBATE FAME ENDED WITH A SPLAT - ESPECIALLY IN OHIO</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1350614484747</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 22:41:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ddd</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1350655738464</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 10:08:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350655744278-53</Id><Topic><Title>Romney nears 270</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350655581315</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 10:06:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RCP map again shows Romney with a 5 electoral vote lead.Where are Junior and Magoo today?LOL</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1350655744278</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 10:09:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350657315164-54</Id><Title>Who's really responsible?</Title><Msg>Unconfirmed story Hillary tried to increase security at Benghazi but was turned down.

But hey, Binder of Women, Book of Broads, Notebook of Nipples, whatever.” –Jon Stewart “In an interview Wednesday Mitt Romney, who had previously stated he would not introduce legislation limiting abortion, vowed that he would still be a ‘pro-life president.’ Which makes sense because Romney defines ‘life’ as anybody making over 250,000 dollars a year.” –Seth Meyers “The time for fact checking is after the event when voters have stopped watching.

Obama now plans to address Romney as ‘Money Bag.’” –Conan O’Brien “Yesterday was National Coming Out Day, a day set aside for people to embrace and announce who they really are.

There are shorter waiting periods for actual abortions.” –Bill Maher “But in his defense, the abortion issue is very personal to Mitt Romney. His own mother considered not having him when doctors told her he would be born heartless and spineless.” –Bill Maher “Isn’t is amazing?

What we want is a president who is 100 percent our #$%$.” –Bill Maher “A new poll found that only 47 percent of voters find Mitt Romney to be trustworthy. Then Romney was like, ‘Well, I hope it’s not the same 47 percent I don’t care about.’” –Jimmy Fallon “Paul Ryan’s handling committee says he just has to do one thing.

On Tuesday, The Boston Herald reported that the Brown campaign was paying homeless people and others a “modest per diem” to wear “Obama Supporters for Brown” t-shirts in neighborhoods that are expected to support Warren. The move was apparently part of a broader attempt to attract black voters to Brown’s campaign. “We want to let black people know that they actually have an option,” former city elections commissioner and “Obama Supporters for Brown” organizer Benjamin Thompson told the Herald. He went on to explain that the Warren campaign “put no money in the black community because urban America, the black community is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Democratic party. If I had my way, every black person in America would be unenrolled and you’d have to fight for our votes.” That Brown thinks he can attract black support by merely dressing up the homeless is embarrassing for a campaign that has already had some well-documented problems with race relations. Perhaps more problematic for Brown, however, is the revelation that he apparently cannot find enough Obama supporters to volunteer for his campaign for free. That bodes poorly for his electoral prospects in deep-blue Massachusetts, which Obama is almost certain to win by double digits on election day. Recent polling of the race seems to confirm this. On Thursday, Public Policy Polling released a new survey showing Warren ahead of Brown by a 53 to 44 percent margin, representing her largest lead of the race—and 81 percent of Democrats now plan to vote for Warren, compared to just 14 percent who support Brown, while Brown’s lead among independent voters is now just 15 points (down from 26 in August.) So while Brown still has a little more than two weeks to turn things around, it appears that his chances of holding on to his seat — and maybe the Republicans’ chances of winning control of the Senate — are getting slimmer by the day.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1350660529970</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 11:28:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350660701246-68</Id><Title>Bain Capital (ROMNEY) Owns Clear Channel (Rush Limbaugh, SEAN HANNITY, Glenn Beck, Michael Savage, Etc.)</Title><Msg>"Wouldn't it be great if a Republican presidential candidate could just buy support of just about every major conservative talk show host in America? Well, Bain Capital became the owner of Clear Channel just a short time before Mitt Romney's first run for president. Clear Channel, largest AM radio stations operator in the US, also owns Premiere Radio Networks, the company that syndicates the radio shows of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, and Glenn Beck, among others. Needless to say, Clear Channel basically owns conservative talk radio in the United States. So who owns Clear Channel? Well, it turns out it's Bain Capital. Yes, you read that correctly. The company that Mitt Romney ran for so long is the "big boss" over virtually all conservative talk radio in America. How far down is America headed when political money can virtually buy a whole media and exclude the other party from having a voice on that media? AM radio is right-wing radio - 24 hours a day."</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1350660701246</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 11:31:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350660778856-69</Id><Topic><Title>New Info in CSCO</Title><Username>elisaverf80108</Username><Timestamp>1350569950260</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:19:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great , i just subscribed!</Msg><Username>libbylicyr356003</Username><Timestamp>1350660778856</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 11:32:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350660948468-70</Id><Title>Cisco providing a good opportunity</Title><Msg>It is times like these that some don't buy but 20% later when we are higher, wish they did.

No resume, no accomplishments, no experience, no original ideas, no understanding of how the economy works, no understanding of how the world works, nothing but abstract, empty rhetoric devoid of real substance. He has no real identity. He is half-white, which he rejects. The rest of him is mostly Arab, which he hides but is disclosed by his non-African Arabic surname and his Arabic first and middle names as a way to triply proclaim his Arabic parentage to people in Kenya . Only a small part of him is African Black from his Luo grandmother, which he pretends he is exclusively. What he isn't, not a genetic drop of, is 'African-American,' the descendant of enslaved Africans brought to America chained in slave ships. He hasn't a single ancestor who was a slave. Instead, his Arab ancestors were slave owners. Slave-trading was the main Arab business in East Africa for centuries until the British ended it. Let that sink in: Obama is not the descendant of slaves, he is the descendant of slave owners. Thus he makes the perfect Liberal Messiah. It's something Hillary doesn't understand - how some complete neophyte came out of the blue and stole the Dem nomination from her. Obamamania is beyond politics and reason. It is a true religious cult, whose adherents reject Christianity yet still believe in Original Sin, transferring it from the evil of being human to the evil of being white. Thus Obama has become the white liberals' Christ, offering absolution from the Sin of Being White. There is no reason or logic behind it, no faults or flaws of his can diminish it, no arguments Hillary could make of any kind can be effective against it. The absurdity of Hypocrisy Clothed In Human Flesh being their Savior is all the more cause for liberals to worship him: Credo quia absurdum, I believe it because it is absurd. Thank heavens that the voting majority of Americans remain Christian and are in no desperate need of a phony savior. His candidacy is ridiculous and should not be taken seriously by any thinking American.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1350663176277</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 12:12:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350663325900-94</Id><Topic><Title>New Info in CSCO</Title><Username>elisaverf80108</Username><Timestamp>1350569950260</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 10:19:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Finally!

How did they do this? Through rigorous enforcement of housing mandates such as theCommunity Reinvestment Act, and by prodding mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make loans to people with lower credit scores (and to buy loans that had been made by banks and, later, “innovators” like Countrywide). The Housing Department was Fannie and Freddie’s top regulator — and under Cuomo the mortgage giants were forced to start ramping up programs to issue more subprime loans to the riskiest of borrowers. We know how that turned out: Fannie and Freddie help stoke a housing bubble that actually made homeownership less affordable unless borrowers took out ever-more-risky loans. Eventually, both agencies imploded (along with the housing market); bailing them out since 2008 has already cost taxpayers more than $100 billion.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1350664040914</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 12:27:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350664051871-99</Id><Title>Unemployment rates fall in 7 US swing states</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unemployment rates fell or held steady last month in nine key swing states at the center of this year's presidential election.

In an editorial announcing the paper's endorsement of GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the editorial board of the large Florida daily delivers some harsh criticisms of the president, while admitting that they're not entirely satisfied with Romney's positions.

"For that reason, though we endorsed him in 2008, we are recommending Romney in this race."</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1350664834485</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 12:40:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350664968808-112</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Has LOST the Female Vote...</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1350664403034</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 12:33:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama once had an 18 point lead with women.Now he and Romney are essentially tied.You dont know what you are talking about.</Msg><Username>doremifa85</Username><Timestamp>1350664968808</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 12:42:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350665286460-113</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Has LOST the Female Vote...</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1350664403034</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 12:33:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>believe the policy of the candidates, not the polls</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1350665286460</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 12:48:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350665321657-114</Id><Title>So disappointed !!</Title><Msg>Checked all the polls today feverishly looking for the big bump Junior said Obama was going to get.

At that time, the Review’s president (with the help of two other editors) oversaw the selection of the new editors of the journal. All Harvard Law students were eligible to apply to the Review at the end of their first year by entering its writing competition, which involved editing an article and/or writing a case comment. New editors were chosen through one of three ways: through their writing competition scores; via a combination of 70% grades and 30% writing scores; or through a supplemental method that included affirmative action. Obama sparked a heated controversy when 27 men, but only 9 women, were selected for the Review. He blamed the result on an insufficient number of women choosing to compete for editorial slots. The arithmetic flaw with Obama’s defense was that women were 40% of the Harvard Law class, 37% of the competitors, and yet only 25% of the editors Obama selected. Under the prior president of the Review (Peter Yu), women were also 37% of the writing competitors but were 41% of selectees. Under Obama’s successor (David Ellen), 37% of the new editors were women. Therefore, among these three successive male editors of the Review (two of whom were minorities), only Obama had a dramatic underrepresentation of women editors. Reacting to the shortfall of new female editors, one of the co-chairs of the Women’s Law Association recommended that women should be included in the Review’s affirmative action program. As quoted in the Harvard Law Record, the law school's newspaper, Obama rejected that recommendation. Mitt Romney as Gov. paid women on par, and in numbers.

States with higher bankruptcy, foreclosure, and unemployment rates got less money. And lower-income states also received less. Rather than helping out those in the toughest shape, it looks like Democrats ended up helping their supporters, including unions and many very wealthy supporters.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1350688267713</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 19:11:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350688521654-265</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S 'WAR ON WOMEN' AT THE HARVARD LAW REVIEW</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350687883419</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 19:04:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Heres a real war on women.In Afghanistan a 20 year old girl refused sex with a suitor.He got the girls mother involved but the girl still refused.The mother then gave the suitor permission to cut the girls head off which he did.</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1350688521654</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 19:15:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350688990900-266</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S 'WAR ON WOMEN' AT THE HARVARD LAW REVIEW</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350687883419</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 19:04:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Question, why didn't this come out in 2008 and why is it just coming out now in 2012.

The rate of violent crime increased by a whopping 17% last year, according to the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), marking the biggest jump since 1993. Property crimes also went up 11% last year. That means that in 2011 there were nearly 6 million violent victimizations and more than 17 million property victimizations, according to the DOJ figures. In an apparent effort to downplay the alarming statistics the feds explain in a press release that the swelling of violent crime is due to an increase in the number of aggravated and simple assaults. There was no “statistically significant change” in the number of more serious crimes such as rapes, sexual assaults and robberies, according to the explanation.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350702961007</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 23:16:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350703166997-289</Id><Topic><Title>Obama DOJ: Growth in Violent Crimes Against Whites</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350702961007</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 23:16:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My personal opinion, when Obama let the Black Panther get away without prosecution for voter intimidation lots of Blacks said Our Bro ain't down with the man, he with the hood.

What can I say? If the left can cling bitterly to Rasmussen as a bulwark against terrible numbers from Gallup, I can cling to this. RCP’s average already had New Hampshire within a point so the new PPP number there isn’t news. The Iowa number is. This is the first poll in a month showing Romney ahead in the state, notwithstanding his blockbuster debate two weeks ago. NBC’s poll last night, in fact, had O up by eight points in Iowa, a ridiculous figure given that Obama’s worried enough to have campaigned there just two days ago but consistent with the CW that it’s his state to lose. Is it? PPP’s newest polls in Iowa and New Hampshire find Mitt Romney leading Barack Obama 49-48 in both states. That represents a big decline for Obama compared to last month. Obama had previously led 51-44 in Iowa and 51-43.5 in New Hampshire on polls conducted the final week of September. Mitt Romney’s seen a big improvement in his image in both states. In Iowa his net favorability has improved 16 points from a -15 spread at 40/55 on our last poll to now 48/47. He’s seen a 10 point ascent on that front in New Hampshire from -5 at 45/50 when we last looked at his favorability in August to now 51/46. Obama’s approval numbers have declined. He was at 49/48 the last time we polled each of these states, but now he’s dropped to 46/50 in Iowa and 47/51 in New Hampshire. Romney has a big advantage on the economy in both of these states that seems to be driving his lead. In New Hampshire voters prefer Romney 52/45 on that front and in Iowa it’s 49/45. The surge in Romney’s favorables is consistent with basically every other poll taken since the demolition in Denver. Interestingly, Iowans think O won the second debate, 45/36, but that hasn’t helped him protect his lead, possibly because the insta-polls taken afterward showed Romney winning on the more important question of the economy. Another interesting bit: No gender gap, despite months of “war on women” yammering and three tedious days of “binders” nonsense. (GRAPH AT LINK) Obama’s in deep trouble if that margin holds, which is why you’re hearing a lot about abortion (and binders) lately. As for the sample, PPP has it 38R/34D/27I whereas the 2008 exit poll was 34D/33R/33I; everyone’s expecting a redder electorate this year, especially since the GOP’s worked hard on building a registration advantage in Iowa, so the partisan split here doesn’t seem wildly implausible. On the other hand, PPP has O up four points among independents, which cuts sharply against the trend nationally.
