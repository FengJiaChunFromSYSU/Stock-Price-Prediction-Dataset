In saying that that study is credible, he has admitted he can’t make his tax promises add up. And yet he constantly, repeatedly says the opposite. Romney has clearly calculated that there aren’t many people who read these analyses and if he just keeps saying his tax plan can cut taxes on the rich while cutting taxes on the middle class while not cutting taxes on the rich while not costing a dime, eventually, his version of this will come to be seen as the truth. And perhaps he’s right. But the numbers show what they show.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1348494139137</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 09:42:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348494295247-14</Id><Topic><Title>obamas out right lies</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1348492174504</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 09:09:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior would love to eat a barrel of Obama's cold poo!!!

These middle-class families also hold a majority disapproval rating on the job Obama is doing as president (45 percent approve, 54 percent disapprove), and turn even more negative toward Obama on specific areas; the economy 56 percent disapprove; spending 61 percent disapprove; taxes, 53 percent disapprove; Medicare 48 percent disapprove; and even foreign policy 50 percent disapprove.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1348495818818</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 10:10:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348495850906-18</Id><Topic><Title>obamas out right lies</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1348492174504</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 09:09:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Got past the censors,didn't it?

In 2010 NTWK went from $8 to $24 in a few weeks. Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

The emergency rooms eventually becomes the doctor, the primary care physician for poor people, and the cost is astronomical. MICHAEL STEELE: And the states have a real problem because they bear a lot of that cost, which is, you know, some of the realities that, as a governor, he would know. MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Mark, does that clip show two Mitts, two different Mitt Romneys? MARK HALPERIN: It shows just how tied in knots he is and how afraid of making a mistake. This is an issue he knows really well. Any governor knows emergency room care is the stupidest possible way to provide care to people and Mitt Romney is so afraid, even on an issue he knows extraordinarily well but one that’s been politically troublesome for him, to say what he really thinks because he doesn’t want to make a mistake. He never can win if he’s tied in knots on something that close to his heart and that he knows so well. MIKA BRZEZINSKI: I’m in pain. That was painful to watch. What would someone from the campaign, what would Mitt Romney say if we showed him these two clips, Michael Steele. OK, help me out here. You take on the campaign and speak for the campaign.

State officials in key presidential battleground states have found only a tiny fraction of the illegal voters they initially suspected existed. Searches in Colorado and Florida have yielded numbers that amount to less than one-tenth of 1 percent of all registered voters in either state. Democrats say the searches waste time and, worse, could disenfranchise eligible voters who are swept up in the checks. "I find it offensive that I'm being required to do more than any other citizen to prove that I can vote," said Samantha Meiring, 37, a Colorado voter and South African immigrant who became a U.S. citizen in 2010. Meiring was among 3,903 registered voters who received letters last month from the Colorado Secretary of State's office questioning their right to vote. Especially telling, critics of the searches say, is that the efforts are focused on crucial swing states from Colorado to Florida, where both political parties and the presidential campaigns are watching every vote. And in Colorado, most of those who received letters are either Democrats or unaffiliated with a party. It's a similar story in Florida, too.</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo27</Username><Timestamp>1348511470347</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:31:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348511489834-84</Id><Title>NYSE: MOH - Molina Healthcare is flying $24.87 +0.36!!!! csco</Title><Msg>.............</Msg><Username>wworld933</Username><Timestamp>1348511489834</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:31:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348511515060-85</Id><Topic><Title>if i got a 94% tax rate i would just fire everyone and go on UE</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1348511250725</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:27:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you really had to pay 94% you should fire your tax preparer.</Msg><Username>careyh50</Username><Timestamp>1348511515060</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 14:31:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348511527717-86</Id><Title>taxing "rich" pre bush levels</Title><Msg>brings about 4-10 billion extra a year in revs for IRS. that is if they claim those profits over 200k and not take write offs against them in the year taxes go up...this is going to happen. anyway obamas gov spends 4.5 billion a day. so two days of gov hahahahahahahahahahahahah you fools are being hood winked. using your envy to snake charm you into irrational hate.

Syrians blocked from Hajj by Saudi Arabia September 18, 2012 8:51 pm TheUnhivedMind Leave a Comment Saudi Arabia blocks Syrians from hajj Tue Sep 18, 2012 4:19PM GMT Saudi Arabia has blocked Syrian citizens from entering the country to perform the annual Muslim pilgrimage of Hajj, Syrian state media says. “The Syrian High Committee of hajj has announced the halt to the pilgrimage this year, due to a failure to reach consensus with the Saudi authorities,” the official SANA news agency reported on Tuesday. According to the report, the Syrian committee “took all necessary steps for the 2012 hajj season, but the relevant ministry in Saudi Arabia did not sign the accord as it does every year”. The hajj to Mecca — the world’s largest annual human assembly — is one of the five pillars of Islam and must be performed at least once in a lifetime by all those Muslims who are able to. Saudi’s move would be the latest in a string of measures adopted by Riyadh against the government of Syria. Syria has been the scene of violence by armed groups since March 2011. The violence has claimed the lives of hundreds of people, including many security forces. Damascus blames “outlaws, saboteurs, and armed terrorist groups” for the unrest, asserting that it is being orchestrated from abroad.

Democrats will notice no difference. They do not work and live in a fog of 'medication' that helps them surmount the reality of their failed lives. I support their right to induce a perpetual state of barely functioning and near coma. They cause much less trouble that way. We need more and cheaper wacky tabaccy for them so they vote less often and sink deeper into the swamp of their own choosing.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1348517316245</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 16:08:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348517392587-142</Id><Topic><Title>Cisco Systems, Inc.</Title><Username>rivkagmb461</Username><Timestamp>1348494019045</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 09:40:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am from Chicago.

That is the date that buyers of the stock will not receive the dividend. The record date is the date that shareholders of the stock are officially recorded and will receive the dividend. It takes a couple of days to settle the trade and record the sale or purchase of the stock. If you own on 10-1 you will receive the full dividend on 10-24. It is not prorated.

They will not be deterred by a failed political system, that has a center (where most people wish to be) that has been make inoperative, by misused "checks and balances" such as the filibuster, political blackmail and block voting. Something like Simpson-Bowles (another name for compromise) cannot "get off the ground". The crux of this article, as I read it, is that there will be no inflation for he next several years allowing a giant effort to begin to create jobs, as the FED tests the limits of its power. Some people (Ron Paul, for example) believe that the FED is the problem, and should be terminated. The power of the FED, I believe, will be very much tied to the results of this election. I think these numbers are more optimistic than others that I have heard. --Lou "Williams projected U.S. gross domestic product to expand by about 1.75% this year, followed by an acceleration in growth to 2.5% in 2013 and 3.25% in 2014. The unemployment rate, he said, is likely to ease to 7.25% by the end of 2014, while inflation remains below the Fed’s target of 2% “for the next several years.” "</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1348538511186</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 22:01:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348539140529-218</Id><Topic><Title>A CLASSIC: ROMNEY WANTS AIRCRAFT WINDOWS TO OPEN.
