It is fri. He now wants congress to bend over for him and rush to Washington and stay up all night to work this out. If I were congress I would simply say to late game player. Game over you deal with it. What a lack of respect he has for people. His ego needs to be smacked with a heaping of reality. He had four years to work this out...now he wants everyone to drop everything because he is ready to solve this? Let him run to the press and blame like a coward child. People will feel this result and remember the pain he inflicted on them. We won't see dems running the show for much longer if the GOP stands their ground. John tell Obama that you are on vacation and you are not available. What do you think it costs taxpayers to fly congress around obamas vacation. Maybe John should use the press as his shoulder to cry on, lucky for Obama he has more class then that.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1356671987662</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 00:19:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356672830650-2</Id><Title>Reid crashed the markets today</Title><Msg>Congress stepped up and fixed the damage. Obamas game is going to backfire on his party. It is already becoming evident. I wish the GOP would just stop playing his game and let bushes tax cuts expire. Give the dems what they have been complaining about the last four years. Bush was the middle classes hero...he cut their taxes not obama. If higher taxes were the path to American prosperity why did Clinton cut them? Why not have a 90% tax rate? You idiots deserve exactly what you deserve.

Kondratiev economics offers a few scenarios. Your war against the rich causes a "class war" and inspires people with guns to either take from the rich and cause a war, or inspires people with guns to protect the rich, and enrich themselves. Basically, Kondratiev says that the economy cannot prosper without an incredible new innovation or a "class struggle" in the form of wealth distribution. The internet slowed the class struggle by ten years. Fracking could slow it another ten. Longer if we invest in American fossil fuel production. Fat chance that the latter will happen under liberals.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1356673507873</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 00:45:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356673822184-5</Id><Title>CLIFF DELAY ON PURPOSE BY CONGRESS SO THEY CAN GO LONG IN STOCKS</Title><Msg>Then pass a soluton just before the deadline..isn't that corruption at its greatest!

The congress and president can only do so much for the emotional state of the markets. If we cross the MOB at the 200 day moving average, we could see a nice correction regardless of what any idiots think about taxing the rich or reducing the nations spending habits. The w8 is one of the most dangerous Elliott formations. Of course it could modify to a w1W2, but I don't think the economy has enough jobs and innovation to start it. A W2 requires lots of motivation and emotion to get rolling.

Along the way to that concern for the caliber of the electorate, Will quotes longtime bad guy Hans von Spakovsky and cites the example of Nazi Germany. Which should tell you pretty much all you need to know about this argument. Will's starting point is that it's not bad that 60 million eligible Americans aren't registered to vote, because maybe they just don't want to be and it would somehow be oppressing them to make it easier for them to register should they decide they want to do that. And if you read a generic "democracy is good" statement by a Justice Department official creatively enough, and you're a paranoid like Will, you can get from easier or universal voter registration to mandatory voting through the logic that if you think democracy is good, you'd enforce it. Will, for his part, does not think democracy is necessarily good. For one thing, there's that whole caliber of the electorate thing if, heaven forbid, more people voted. (So keeping people in low-voting populations from voting tends to improve the caliber of the electorate, we have to infer.) For another: Those who think high voter turnout indicates civic health should note that in three German elections, 1932-33, turnout averaged more than 86 percent, reflecting the terrible stakes: The elections decided which mobs would rule the streets and who would inhabit concentration camps. As Media Matters' Simon Maloy details, Germany was in bad shape in the early 1930s. None of that, however, is an argument against the high voter turnout as a sign of "civic health." It's an argument against war, depression, anti-Semitism, Nazis, Communists, and political violence. Will could just as easily have argued that representative government, or elections themselves, aren't a sign of "civic health," given how they were misused and perverted by Hitler and his associates. Maloy probably shouldn't tempt Will like that, because it's actually about the same size of jump from "the Nazis show that high voter turnout is scary" to "the Nazis show that elections are scary" as from "voter registration shouldn't be a difficult hoop to jump through" to "voting should be mandatory." Remember, this is one of the alleged serious intellectual voices of the Republican Party. And he's arguing against increased voter turnout by citing Hitler. Enough said, I think?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1356709467171</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 10:44:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356709481590-39</Id><Topic><Title>Keep watching Junior.</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1356707209616</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 10:06:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can't even read, fool.

Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy, University of California at Berkeley; Author, 'Beyond Outrage' GET UPDATES FROM Robert Reich Cliff Hanger: Why Republicans Don't Care What the Nation Thinks Posted: 12/28/2012 8:42 am Are House Republicans -- now summoned back to Washington by Speaker John Boehner -- about to succumb to public pressure and save the nation from the fiscal cliff? Don't bet on it. Even if Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell cooperates by not mounting a filibuster and allows the Senate to pass a bill extending the Bush tax cuts to the first $250,000 of everyone's income, Boehner may not bring it to the House floor. On a Thursday conference call with House Republicans he assured conservatives he was "not interested" in allowing such a vote if most House Republicans would reject the bill, according to a source on the call. Democrats are confident that even if the nation technically goes over the cliff January 1, Boehner will bring such a bill to the floor soon after January 3 -- once House Republicans have reelected him Speaker -- and it will get passed. But this assumes Boehner and the GOP will be any more swayed by public opinion than they are now. Public opinion is already running strongly in favor of President Obama and the Democrats, and against the GOP. In the latest CNN/ORC poll, 48 percent say they'll blame Republicans if no deal is reached while 37 percent blame Obama. Confidence in congressional Republicans is hovering at about 30 percent; Obama is enjoying the confidence of 46 percent. And over half of all Americans think the GOP is too extreme. Yet Republicans haven't budged. The fact is, they may not care a hoot about the opinions of most Americans. That's because the national party is in disarray. Boehner isn't worried about a challenge to his leadership; no challenger has emerged. The real issue is neither he nor anyone else is in charge of the GOP. Romney's loss, along with the erosion of their majority in the House and Democratic gains in the Senate, has left a vacuum at the top. House Republicans don't run nationally. They run only in their own districts -- which, because of gerrymandering, are growing even more purely Republican. Their major concern is being reelected in 2014, and their biggest potential obstacle in their way is a primary challenge from the right. The combination of a weakened national party and more intense competition in primaries is making the Republican Party relatively impervious to national opinion. This poses a large strategic problem for the Democrats. It could be an even bigger problem for the nation. ROBERT B.
