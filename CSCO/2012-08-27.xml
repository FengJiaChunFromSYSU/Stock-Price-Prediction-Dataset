Ice in the Arctic has shrunk to its lowest level on record, scientists from the National Snow and Ice Data Center announced Monday, smashing a mark set in 2007. The ice typically doesn't reach its smallest point until September, so more melting is likely in the weeks ahead.

Enlarge U.S. Coast Guard Scattered ice floes are seen from the bridge of the RV Healy on Aug. 20 northwest of Barrow, Alaska. Sponsored Links The data center reported Monday that the extent of Arctic sea ice shrank to 1.58 million square miles on Sunday. That breaks the old record of 1.61 million square miles from 2007. Figures are based on satellite records dating back to 1979. The sea ice in question is frozen ocean water that melts each summer and then refreezes each winter. It typically reaches its smallest "extent" in September and largest "extent" in March of each year. The ice has been melting unusually rapidly this summer: On average, 38,000 square miles of ice has been melting per day since June, an area roughly the size of Indiana each day. Once it's done melting, the ice could shrink to under 1.5 million square miles sometime in September, the data center says. Summer sea ice is melting at a rate faster than was predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations group of several thousand scientists that issues reports on global warming every few years. The most recent report was in 2007, which predicted that the Arctic summer would be ice-free by 2100.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346099032520</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 16:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346099293560-116</Id><Topic><Title>global warming is established science</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346099032520</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 16:23:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have been going to Colorado for the last 15 years.
