The debate in Washington about economic policy is phony. It’s manufactured. And it’s entirely political. Let’s start with Obama’s stimulus. The standard Republican talking point is that it failed, meaning it didn’t reduce unemployment. Yet in a survey of leading economists conducted by the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, 92 percent agreed that the stimulus succeeded in reducing the jobless rate. On the harder question of whether the benefit exceeded the cost, more than half thought it did, one in three was uncertain, and fewer than one in six disagreed. Or consider the widely despised bank bailouts. Populist politicians on both sides have taken to pounding the table against them (in many cases, only after voting for them). But while the public may not like them, there’s a striking consensus that they helped: The same survey found no economists willing to dispute the idea that the bailouts lowered unemployment. No Support Do you remember the Republican concern that Obama had somehow caused gas prices to rise, a development that Newt Gingrich promised to reverse? There’s simply no support among economists for this view. They unanimously agreed that “market factors,” rather than energy policy, have driven changes in gas prices. How about the oft-cited Republican claim that tax cuts will boost the economy so much that they will pay for themselves? It’s an idea born as a sketch on a restaurant napkin by conservative economist Art Laffer. Perhaps when the top tax rate was 91 percent, the idea was plausible. Today, it’s a fantasy. The Booth poll couldn’t find a single economist who believed that cutting taxes today will lead to higher government revenue -- even if we lower only the top tax rate. The consensus isn’t the result of a faux poll of left-wing ideologues. Rather, the findings come from the Economic Experts Panel run by Booth’s Initiative on Global Markets. It’s a recurring survey of about 40 economists from around the U.S. It includes Democrats, Republicans and independent academics from the top economics departments in the country. The only things that unite them are their first-rate credentials and their interest in public policy. Let’s be clear about what the economists’ remarkable consensus means. They aren’t purporting to know all the right answers. Rather, they agree on the best reading of murky evidence. The folks running the survey understand this uncertainty, and have asked the economists to rate their confidence in their answers on a scale of 1 to 10. Strikingly, the consensus looks even stronger when the responses are weighted according to confidence. The debate in Washington has become completely unmoored from this consensus, and in a particular direction: Angry Republicans have pushed their representatives to adopt positions that are at odds with the best of modern economic thinking. That may be good politics, but it’s terrible policy. The disjunction between the state of economic knowledge and our current political debate has important consequences. Right now, millions of people are suffering due to high unemployment. Our textbooks are filled with possible solutions. Instead of debating them seriously, congressional Republicans are blocking even those policy proposals that strike most economists as uncontroversial.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1343226871380</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 10:34:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343226886964-34</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN CAN WE FLUSH ALL DEMOCRATS?</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1343164931617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 17:22:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surfy, one addendum, I still consider you the most thoughtful liberal drooler!!!</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1343226886964</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 10:34:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343226944321-35</Id><Topic><Title>ECONOMIST TORPEDO EVERY REPUKE LIE...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1343226871380</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 10:34:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Raw Politics This inaction has no basis in economics. Instead, it’s raw politics -- a cynical attempt to score points in a phony rhetorical war or a way of preventing their opponents from scoring a policy win. The debate about the long-run challenge posed by the federal budget deficit has also become divorced from economic reality. The same panel of economists was almost unanimous in agreeing that “long run fiscal sustainability in the U.S. will require cuts in currently promised Medicare and Medicaid benefits and/or tax increases that include higher taxes on households with incomes below $250,000.” Only one in 10 was uncertain. None objected. Likewise, popular tax deductions such as that for mortgage interest didn’t fare well in the surveys and would be on almost any economist’s list of targets for reform. Yet neither party is willing to propose such policies. The consensus, of course, can be wrong. On the probable consequences of economic reforms, though, leading economists are more likely to be right than politicians running for re- election. Their solidarity needs to be taken seriously. Too much of what passes for economic debate in Washington is the product of faith, not evidence. It’s time to put economics back into the economic debate.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1343226944321</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 10:35:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343226945849-36</Id><Topic><Title>Is it me or is CSCO always a long term buy?</Title><Username>blackstinkypuss</Username><Timestamp>1343191688187</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 00:48:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You nailed it on the head.

They have $9 plus almost $2 per year in FCF. It is insane that the price is now down below $15. This happened because a company with $4 billion in revenue bought a company with less that $10 million in revenue and this is suspose to be the end of CSCO. CSCO spends far more than the combination on R&amp;D. Windows was created 30 years ago so that software could replace switches. This is not exactly a new concept. There are still plenty of switches in use. Besides, CSCO is not a switch company. The sell results and switches, other hardware, other software and much expertise are used to achieve the results.</Msg><Username>dewey_duhawk</Username><Timestamp>1343227076187</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 10:37:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343227118049-40</Id><Topic><Title>ECONOMIST TORPEDO EVERY REPUKE LIE...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1343226871380</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 10:34:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just as soon as we get rid of the Democratic stranglehold on the dying American economy, it will bloom like a rose!!!

Yes, they can… July 25, 2012 By mario piperni 10 Comments Have you seen this bit of mind-numbing drivel from Fox and Friends yet? Some idiot thought it would be a wonderful idea to bring on a 4-year old girl and her 7-year old sister to make the case that President Obama is anti-business. Brian Kilmeade introduced the two girls as entrepreneurs who are running a lemonade stand without government assistance and (he actually said this), “without any help.” Here, just watch it. WARNING: Cringe Alert is in effect (e.g. the 7-year old says that she can’t give the recipe for the lemonade because it is “proprietary” information. Sheesh.) Just when you thought that Fox could not sink any lower, they embarrass themselves with stupidity of this sort. The irony of this sad spectacle is that the girls lend credence to exactly what the President said. They had help in starting their ‘business’ from their “investors” (dad, stepmom and others). Also, of course, there would be no lemonade stand without the roads and sidewalks to get people to the stand and there would be no actual lemonade without the water filtration plants to purify the water. And let’s not get into the lemons which were grown in orchards by farmers who probably operate because of government subsidies. Nor, I imagine, should we mention the schools that teach 7-year olds how to write words like ‘L-E-M-O-N-A-D-E’. The only positive coming out of all this was that Fox viewers got to listen to guests who matched not only their level of knowledge, but that of the hosts as well.

It is odorless, harmless to helpful and beneficial insects and people, but has actually been proven to eliminate harmful virus laden mosquitos and all Democrats!!! Thank goodness, the right combination of chemicals has been determined!!! Already, along the North East coastal area, in large population densities, night time spraying has begun. Soon population of blood sucking insects and blood sucking Democratic parasites will begin to dwindle. The mosquitos will simply disappear, the Democrats will lose all initiative, sit and stare at TV in a vacant, slack jawed fashion, loosing all bowel and bladder control, such that their keepers will move them off the couch into stainless steel, easily washable facilities, where they will continue to be liberally supplied with all the usual narcotics, drugs, alcohol and deviant sexual toys they so much enjoy ;however, due to the marvelous effects of this new 'mosquito' spray, they will continue the intellectual decline so well established in all Democrats at an increased and rapidly INCREASING rate, such that they will stop all forms of communication, will experience decreased appetite in all arena's of human endeavor, will no longer walk to the post office to pick up a government check, will cease all breeding activity and will experience the same massive decline our economy has endured under Barrack. Within a few short months, 99% of all Democrats, exposed to the mosquito spray, will be moved into the large warehouses now in Idaho for transport to China, under an agreement related to job outsourcing. They will be docile and happy to continue the parasitic life style Democrats have established for six decades, but will now find that China is a fun place to live and work. There, organs will be harvested as needed so that Democrat will actually be useful to society, albeit, at a rather reduced capacity. How long can they collect benefits when both kidneys' have been 'donated' to Chinese health and happiness? Still, it's a better life than they had in Baltimore! They'll be a lot safer in crime free China......until the last kidney is 'donated' anyway.</Msg><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1343238213381</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 13:43:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343238397721-91</Id><Topic><Title>Reality is a Liberal Conspiracy!!</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo9</Username><Timestamp>1343234055582</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 12:34:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually - commie - the ronmey tax cuts will slow the ice melt -</Msg><Username>hulksweider2000</Username><Timestamp>1343238397721</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 13:46:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343238531667-92</Id><Title>job off shoring?

At the current share price ($15.32 as I write this), Cisco looks like it is in deep value turf. The company has $5.87 in cash per share, meaning the ex-cash price per share is under $10. With forward EPS projected at $1.84, the forward P/E is a dirt cheap 5.5. While Cisco faces macroeconomic headwinds due to a global slowdown, analysts at Sterne Agee still have a $23 price target, representing 44% upside to the current stock price. They're not the only ones who believe the stock is undervalued. Value investor Donald Yacktman, who holds a 4% stake in Cisco in both his Yacktman Fund and his Yacktman Focused Fund, had this to say about Cisco's valuation in his Q2 holdings report: Cisco declined after releasing cautious earnings guidance. The company has over $5 per share in excess cash and investments on the balance sheet, and we think the business can generate more than $1.60 per share in free cash flow. This puts the stock at less than 8 times adjusted free cash flow, a multiple which we believe hardly requires robust business results. It is true that Cisco faces challenges. However, it is important to remember that it still has a strong core business: Cisco already owns a 77% global market share of enterprise routing, and integration of cloud solutions gives Cisco added value as the industry transitions toward the cloud. And as Yacktman stated, at the current valuation, explosive growth isn't required - a few quarters of solid execution, and Cisco should start to receive valuations more in-line with the market as a whole. While Cisco shares are cheap already, investors who think it might decline a little more could use a put writing strategy. The August '12 $16 strike has a good chance of assignment if Cisco stays flat, and results in a cost basis upon assignment of $14.95 - approximately 2.5% lower than the current share price. An investor who thinks Cisco might continue to decline could instead write the $15 strike puts, pocketing a 3% return for the holding period (36% annualized) if assignment does not occur, and getting shares with a $14.51 cost basis if assignment does occur.</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1343238904045</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 13:55:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343238939275-97</Id><Topic><Title>Reality is a Liberal Conspiracy!!</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo9</Username><Timestamp>1343234055582</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 12:34:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>oh! the sky is falling, the sky is falling, the ice is melting, we gonna get hit by a meteor. the volcanoes gonna blow up, the ice is melting, it's too hot in Iowa...they aint gonna be any corn, the ice is melting, the sky is falling, the sky is falling....

BOYsurfer comparing taxes to spending. Secondly, if you want to argue spending money on roads that everyone benefits from than fine have that arguement. Planned Parenthood has turned into nothing more than a vessel for irresponsible women who can easily remedy a mistake by KILLING a baby. Too bad you and your kind can never get the arguement right. If you want an organization that commits acts that are offensive to many, then fund it privately, I don't want MY tax dollars going to every dolly, molly, and holly who spreads their legs and wants me to pick up the pieces.
