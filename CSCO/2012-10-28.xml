In the three-day period ending on Oct. 23, says Gallup, 53 percent said they approved of the job Obama was doing and 42 percent said they did not. On Oct. 24, that dropped to 51 percent who said they approved and 44 percent who said they do not. On Oct. 25, it dropped again to 48 percent who said they approved and 47 percent who said they do not. On Oct. 26, it dropped yet again to 46 percent who said they approved and 49 percent who said they did not. In May 2011, Obama's approval dropped 7 points in four days, sliding from 53 percent on May 24 to 46 percent on May 28.

The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship.

Analysis: Hoax. The original April 1, 2009 posting date suggests it may have been intended as an April Fools prank, but given that the text does little else but parrot actual tenets of the so-called "Birther" movement (those who claim Barack Obama is ineligible for the presidency due to a forged or invalid birth certificate, etc.), it barely qualifies as satire. Is it really an AP news story? No. The Associated Press ("AP") never published such a story. It didn't run in any real newspaper, nor on any real wire service. It can, however, be found posted and reposted on hundreds of anti-Obama blogs and websites. Is it true that the Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on Obama's citizenship and eligibility? No. The Supreme Court has refused to hear every case challenging Obama's Constitutional eligibility submitted to date. Did a group called "Americans for Freedom of Information" release Obama's Occidental College transcripts? No. The organization doesn't exist — or didn't at the time the above message first began circulating, at any rate. A similarly-named website went up after the fact, but there's no evident connection between that website and this fake news story. Has anyone released Obama's Occidental College transcripts? No, the transcripts haven't been released (federal privacy laws forbid it), nor has any court of law "ordered" them released. (Source: Occidental College) Did Obama attend Occidental under the name "Barry Soetoro"? No. Soetoro was the surname of his stepfather, but there's no evidence Barack Obama used it when he attended college. Fellow alumni quoted in the press remember him as "Barry Obama." According to an Occidental spokesperson quoted on FactCheck.org, the college has no records showing Obama used his stepfather's last name. Did Obama attend Occidental under a Fulbright Scholarship for Foreign Students? No. According to various news sources Obama did attend on a scholarship, but it wasn't a Fulbright scholarship, let alone a Fulbright scholarship for foreign students. The Fulbright Foreign Student Program accepts Master's Degree and Ph.D. candidates only. Obama, an undergraduate, was neither. He couldn't have been awarded a Fulbright scholarship for foreign students even if he had been born outside the U.S. (Source: Fulbright Program)</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351455718623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 16:21:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351455973070-48</Id><Title>A concerned mother</Title><Msg>As Romney continues to surge towards the presidency ,Junior's mommy is getting increasingly worried.

Junior got conned by a fraud. Everything you care about and believe in is a complete sham. You are a brainwashed lemming pawn. Most Americans don’t realize we have elected a president whom we know very little about. Researchers have discovered that Obama’s autobiographical books are little more than PR stunts, as they have little to do with the actual events of his life. The fact is we know less about President Obama than perhaps any other president in American history and much of this is due to actual efforts to hide his record. This should concern all Americans. A nation-wide network of researchers has sprung up to attempt to fill in the blanks, but at every opportunity Obama’s high-priced lawyers have built walls around various records or simply made them disappear. It is estimated that Obama’s legal team has now spent well over $1.4 million dollars blocking access to documents every American should have access to. The question is why would he spend so much money to do this? The president who campaigned for a more “open government” and “full disclosure” will not unseal his medical records, his school records, his birth records or his passport records. He will not release his Harvard records, his Columbia College records, or his Occidental College records—he will not even release his Columbia College thesis. All his legislative records from the Illinois State Senate are missing and he claims his scheduling records during those State Senate years are lost as well. In addition, no one can find his school records for the elite K-12 college prep school, Punahou School, he attended in Hawaii. What is he hiding? Well, for starters, some of these records will shed light on his citizenship and birth. For example, Obama’s application to Punahou School – now mysteriously missing – would likely contain a birth certificate. And, according to attorney Gary Kreep, “his Occidental College records are important as they may show he attended there as a foreign exchange student.” Indeed, Obama used his Indonesian name “Barry Soetoro” while attending Occidental</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351456494847</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 16:34:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351456696922-53</Id><Topic><Title>Obama received Fulbright Scholarship</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351451509883</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 15:11:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What’s more, there are questions about how he paid for his Harvard Law School education since, despite a claim by Michele Obama, no one has produced any evidence that he received student loans. The Obamas will not release any student loan details despite repeated requests from the Chicago Tribune. However, it appears that his Harvard education may have been paid for by a foreign source. Khalid Al-Mansour, an advisor to Saudi prince Al-Walid bin Talah, told Manhattan Borough president, Percy Sutton, that he was raising money for Obama’s Harvard tuition. Incidentally, Prince Tala is the largest donor to CAIR, a Muslim group declared by the U.S. Government in 2007 as an unindicted co-conspirator in a terrorist financing trial. At least three of CAIR’s leaders have been indicted for terrorist activities. Al-Mansour’s admission opens up speculation as to whether Muslim interests have assisted Obama’s career in the hope he would eventually be in a position someday to promote their interests. More recently, it was discovered that Obama’s Selective Service card may have been doctored. Federal law requires all American males to register for the Selective Service (the draft) in case a major war broke out. Blogger Debbie Schlussel has discovered solid evidence that Obama’s Selective Service registration form was submitted not when he was younger as required, but rather in 2008 and then altered to look older. Indeed, the forgers forgot to alter the “Document Location Number” which shows that it is clearly a 2008 form. This is fraud and it’s a felony and Schlussel’s allegations are backed up by Stephen Coffman, a former high-ranking Federal agent. Moreover, the document shows a September 4th, 1980 date and the location of the transaction as Hawaii, but at that time Obama was thousands of miles away attending Occidental College in Los Angeles. The real reason why Obama probably did not submit this form as a teenager is that he assumed his Kenyan or Indonesian citizenship exempted him from this requirement. But clearly, as he grew older and entered politics, he saw that any documents revealing a foreign birth – Selective Service registration, birth certificate, school applications, etc – would be problematic if he ran for the presidency. Thus, it is not a coincidence that every document which contains information about his birth or citizenship is either missing, sealed, or has been altered.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351456696922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 16:38:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351458338647-54</Id><Topic><Title>Obama watched the TV while Embassy attacked &amp; did nothing</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351399439039</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 00:43:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I understand over a hundred administration people watched the 7 hour long attack on the video feed from the drone and nobody sent in the Cavalry to rescue our people.

Heading up FEMA was sort of like heading up the embassy in Luxembourg (George H.W. Bush appointed his chief of staff’s next-door neighbor), and, as a 1995 Washington Monthly article by Daniel Franklin discovered, the agency historically had ten times the proportion of political appointees as other agencies. Worse still, up until the 1990s, most of FEMA’s budget went toward planning for the aftermath of a nuclear attack—natural disasters ranked low on the priority list. In 1992, after Hurricane Andrew smashed up the Florida coast and left 200,000 people homeless, FEMA took three days to respond and rarely instilled much confidence. As the Washington Monthly noted, FEMA officials sent down to do damage assessment arrived a week late and had no experience whatsoever. The Hurricane Andrew fiasco was shocking enough to prompt big changes. In 1993, Bill Clinton ended up appointing a head—James Lee Witt—who had actual emergency management experience back in Arkansas. Witt revamped the agency, hired qualified staffers, and shifted money away from preparing for nuclear Armageddon. The agency later won praise for its quick response to the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995. Even Republican Jim Inhofe, no fan of Clinton, hailed Witt’s performance. But those reforms didn’t last. In 2000, George W. Bush appointed Joe Allbaugh to head FEMA. Allbaugh didn’t have any disaster-management expertise, but he hadhelped run Bush’s campaign. Allbaugh soon testified before Congress that the federal government should scale back its disaster-planning efforts, and, after September 11, FEMA was folded into Homeland Security to focus on terrorism. In 2002, Allbaugh was succeeded by Michael Brown, whose main claim to fame was getting fired as attorney for the International Arabian Horse Association. Not surprisingly, FEMA’s performance during Katrina was a mess: As numerous news stories documented, the agency was slow to react to the crisis and took forever to get buses, water, fuel, and other supplies to affected areas. So what has Barack Obama done to make the agency better? To his credit, he appointed as head of FEMA Craig Fugate, who had actual relevant experience directing Florida’s emergency-management division. And there are early signs that the agency is improving. Back in 2003, the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, began taking surveys of federal workers, asking questions about morale, whether they have adequate resources, and how able their leaders are. Max Stier, the CEO of Partnership for Public Service, told me that these metrics may not be perfect, but they correlate pretty well with performance in the private sector (many large companies conduct similar surveys to identify problem areas early on). Back in 2003, FEMA ranked dead last among agencies. “Just looking at that, there was a pretty good bet that, when a crisis hit, FEMA wouldn’t be able to deal with it,” says Stier. And now? Since Fugate was appointed, the agency’s scores have risen slightly, especially in employee assessments of the senior leadership. Disaster experts also note that there are a few key things FEMA has done right. After the Alabama tornadoes, for instance, the agency talked to White House officials about getting a federal emergency declaration ready even before Alabama made a formal request to do so. Historically, FEMA has waited for formal requests before mobilizing—a big cause of delays during Katrina.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351463922821</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 18:38:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351463972101-63</Id><Title>Mitt says if you have a flooding problem</Title><Msg>you should go back home and call 211, guess that's a new emergency number like 911 just for flooding, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351463972101</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 18:39:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351464557896-64</Id><Topic><Title>glad we have professionals at FEMA now</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351463922821</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 18:38:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice job brownie</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1351464557896</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 18:49:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351465922408-65</Id><Title>Haaretz: Most Joowish Israelis want Romney to win</Title><Msg>Poll: Most Israeli Jews back Romney, most Israeli Arabs support Obama The October Peace Index reveals significant differences in Israeli attitudes towards the American presidential candidates and upcoming Israeli elections.

The poll - carried out between October 22 and 24, and conducted among a representative sample of 601 respondents with a margin of error of 4.5 percent - shows significant differences in Israeli attitudes towards the American presidential candidates and upcoming Israeli elections. Support for Romney includes 70 percent of self-defined right-wingers, 54 percent of centrists, and 30 percent of left-wingers. However, a plurality of Arab Israelis prefers Obama (45 percent) over Romney (15 percent). More than two-thirds of Israeli Jews (69 percent) do not believe that the results of the American November 6 elections will affect the outcome of Israeli elections, while 51 percent of Israeli Arabs believe they will. Israeli elections turnout may increase dramatically as 90 percent of Jewish Israelis are either certain or believe they will vote. In the last elections in 2009, voter turnout was only 68 percent. While a majority of Jewish Israelis (52 percent) believe that party ideology should be the deciding factor in casting one's vote, only a minority of Arab Israelis (29 percent) would agree. A majority of Jewish Israelis (53 percent) believe that there was no real opportunity for the current government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to renew negotiations with the Palestinians.

"We're looking at a negative 1.7 percent GDP growth for the first quarter and that means jobs and that companies like ours are going to have to pull back on our capital investment," Mark Bertolini, Aetna's (AET) CEO, told CNBC. "The sooner we get clarity the more we can invest in the economy." Kathryn Wylde, Partnership for New York City CEO, echoed that sentiment. "We've got more than $1 trillion sitting on the sidelines tied up in our American businesses that they're not putting to work because they can't figure out what's going to happen in Washington," she said. "We've lost faith that there's a solution to this problem. We have to bring this country together to get something done, and then we can all benefit." Obama suk.

In a new Pew Research Center poll conducted this month, the study shows that it was bad enough when members of both parties were asked whether the United States is too supportive of Israel; twice as many Democrats agreed; 25% to 13%. But the real shocker was another question: “Do you think the United States is not supportive enough of Israel?” The response was more than illuminating; it was a thunderclap that should rock Israel supporting liberals to the core. 46% of Republicans said the U.S. was not supportive enough, while only 9% of Democrats thought so. That figure of 9% shows that the anti-Israel activity seen at the 2012 DNC was not an accident. The Democratic Party no longer gives a damn about the State of Israel. Abortion is their primary issue, followed by gay rights. Jews who care more about the Democrats’ support of abortion and gay rights, which directly contravene traditional Jewish principles, rather than the survival of Israel, represent Judaism as falsely as Barack Obama invoking Ronald Reagan when it behooved him. If they remain in the Democratic Party, they have no right to complain when the liberal hordes discard them –as they will soon enough.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351469860186</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:17:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351469976381-82</Id><Topic><Title>DEMOCRAT PARTY TAKING VAN FULL OF SOMALIA TERORISTS TO VOTING BOOTHS IN OHIO #$%$??</Title><Username>unemployed_obama_youth</Username><Timestamp>1351363544612</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:45:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama campaignis obviously crookeder than a dogs hind leg.</Msg><Username>algore_eats_his_own_boogers</Username><Timestamp>1351469976381</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:19:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351470077189-83</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA REFUSES TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS BENGAZI COVERUP</Title><Username>nancy_pelosi_is_an_eyesore</Username><Timestamp>1351366197154</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 15:29:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4 People died from Obama's negligence ,so Obama aint talking.</Msg><Username>algore_eats_his_own_boogers</Username><Timestamp>1351470077189</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:21:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351470147476-84</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA ADMIN BORROWS $$$ FROM CHINA TO PROVIDE FREE HEALTHCARE TO TERRORISTS</Title><Username>super_samoann</Username><Timestamp>1351364162076</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:56:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not suprized.

However, forecasters warned people not to focus on the storm center. Howling winds extend hundreds of miles from the eye of Sandy and are starting to impact coastal regions already. The National Hurricane Center reported that tropical storm force winds (from 39-73 mph) extend out 520 miles in many directions from the center of Sandy. As of 2 p.m., the center of the storm was located about 575 miles due south of New York City, with sustained wind speeds of 75 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity. Sandy was moving to the northeast at 14 mph. Since records of storm size began in 1988, no tropical storm or hurricane has been larger, reports meteorologist Jeff Masters of the Weather Underground..

"Simonek has also volunteered with various youth organizations in Los Angeles and Orange County, which placed him in direct contact with young boys," Garcia said. "Based on the investigation, it is believed Simonek sought these volunteer and counselor positions which allowed him to interact with boys he could potentially victimize."

It’s time for new leadership from Mitt Romney, a governor and business leader with a record of solving problems." Newspapers endorsing Romney almost uniformly point to his private-sector business experience and intimate knowledge of the free enterprise system. They also cite his commitment to the limited spending and low tax rates the newspapers' editors see as necessary for the economy to return to a robust state. Obama suk.

Obama slipping in Ohio. “The race for the White House continues to be too close to call in Ohio, according to a new Enquirer/Ohio News Organization Poll that shows President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney each with 49 percent support from likely voters,” the Cincinnati Enquirer reported Sunday. “That’s a slip for the president, who took 51 percent of likely voters in the newspaper group’s September poll.” A turd flushing down a toilet.

If you want the Palistinian Arabs taking care of Christian shrines than your a total fool. Me I like the fact that Israel on average buys $100 million in US Treasuries at every auction for many years. Seems to me Mossad has shared its great intel to our advantage and tested our military products on the battlefield and gave us feedback on what worked and what didn't. Friends like Israel don't deserve that Obama is fine with them being Nuked. You I am sure want to see them Nuked and all the hundreds of thousand Christians who live in Israel too.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351479715605</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:01:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351479925081-112</Id><Topic><Title>ALL FOUR MAJOR IOWA NEWSPAPERS ENDORSE ROMNEY</Title><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351469356526</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 20:09:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great news</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351479925081</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:05:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
