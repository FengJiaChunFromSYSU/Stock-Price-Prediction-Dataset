John Kerry to serve as the next Secretary of State. This is not much of a surprise, since the other reported leading candidate for the post, UN ambassador Susan Rice, withdrew herself from consideration last Thursday. For climate hawks, having Kerry at the helm at State would be very good news. Kerry is among the most fierce advocates for climate action in the Senate. Here he is in a floor speech from August talking about why climate change is "as significant a level of importance" as Syria and Iran: Well, this issue actually is of as significant a level of importance, because it affects life itself on the planet. Because it affects ecosystems on which the oceans and the land depend for the relationship of the warmth of our earth and the amount of moisture that there is and all of the interactions that occur as a consequence of our climate. Kerry is also the co-author of the last major climate bill anyone tried to pass in the Senate. At its rollout in September 2009, he called the bill "the beginning of one of the most important battles we will ever face, as legislators and as citizens." He's also been a champion of international climate action since way back in 1992, when he attended the first major meeting on it in Rio, Brazil. On the 20th anniversary of the Rio summit this year, Kerry made a floor a statement on the ongoing climate paralysis: Twenty years ago this month, a Republican President of the United States helped bring together all the world's largest economies in Rio to confront the issue of global climate change. The President was unequivocal about the mission. George Herbert Walker Bush said simply, "The United States fully intends to be the world's preeminent leader in protecting the global environment." How dramatic and sad it is that twenty years later, shockingly, we find ourselves in a strange and dangerous place on this issue—a place this former President wouldn't even recognize. When it comes to the challenge of climate change, the falsehood of today's naysayers is only matched by the complacency of our political system ... We should be compelled to fight today’s insidious conspiracy of silence on climate change—a silence that empowers misinformation and mythology to grow where science and truth should prevail. It is a conspiracy that has not just stalled, but demonized any constructive effort to put America in a position to lead the world on this issue, as President Bush promised we would and as Americans have a right to expect we will. That's not to say that Clinton hasn't also expressed interest in climate change; she has. But it seems that it would be far higher up the priorities list for Kerry.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355921039035</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 07:43:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355921981249-14</Id><Topic><Title>War Hero to Climate Hawk, good choice</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355921039035</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 07:43:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>John Kerry will sell American's out, just like he did in the 70's.

Personally, and since you posted an opinion I kind of have a free hand, I am more interested in what the next 6 months to a year will bring. I'm seeing a gradual and measured rebound from the gloom and doom of the recent past. Unemployment is down, yes the knuckleheads are fudging the number but I SEE more shoppers this Christmas. That can only happen if there is some free money floating around. Since I see the economy improving, it logically follows that businesses will beging to add to their tech side since we all know that tech doesn't stand still. There is a pent up demand for tech upgrade. CSCO will profit from this. Too far, too fast...good warning. A small pullback doesn't faze me, the fundies here are OK and strengthening. Target $25 by this time next year. About a 25% bump...not a bad year's work.</Msg><Username>burgresident</Username><Timestamp>1355924960489</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 08:49:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355925840088-16</Id><Topic><Title>War Hero to Climate Hawk, good choice</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355921039035</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 07:43:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Drill Here, Drill Now! 332 Capn</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355925840088</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:04:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355926436864-17</Id><Topic><Title>Looking to SHORT Cisco</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1355918318825</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 06:58:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Long term and your $25 target in a year is an easy target and I tend to agree with it.

They lived on deer in the mountains during the summer and would go to the coast and live on fish and lobster in the winter. The two most important events in all of history were the invention of beer and the invention of the wheel. The wheel was invented to get man to the beer. These were the foundation of modern civilization and together were the catalyst for the splitting of humanity into two distinct subgroups: 1 . Liberals 2. Conservatives. Once beer was discovered, it required grain and that was the beginning of agriculture. Neither the glass bottle nor aluminum can were invented yet, so while our early humans were sitting around waiting for them to be invented, they just stayed close to the brewery. That's how villages were formed. Some men spent their days tracking and killing animals to BBQ at night while they were drinking beer. This was the beginning of what is known as the Conservative movement. Other men who were weaker and less skilled at hunting learned to live off the conservatives by showing up for the nightly BBQ's and doing the sewing, fetching, and hair dressing. This was the beginning of the Liberal movement. Some of these liberal men eventually evolved into women. They became known as girlie-men. Some noteworthy liberal achievements include the domestication of cats, the invention of group therapy, group hugs, and the concept of Democratic voting to decide how to divide the meat and beer that Conservatives provided and became the ultimate "gimme faction". Over the years conservatives came to be symbolized by the largest, most powerful land animal on earth, the elephant. Liberals are symbolized by the jackass for obvious reasons. Modern liberals like imported beer (with lime added), but most prefer white wine or imported bottled water. They eat raw fish but like their beef well done. Sushi, tofu, and French food are standard liberal fare.. Another interesting evolutionary side note: most of their women have higher testosterone levels than their men. Most social workers, personal injury attorneys, journalists, dreamers in Hollywood and group therapists are liberals. Liberals invented the designated hitter rule because it wasn't fair to make the pitcher also bat. Conservatives drink domestic beer, mostly Bud or Miller. They eat red meat and still provide for their women. Conservatives are big game hunters, rodeo cowboys, lumberjacks,construction workers, firemen, paramedics, medical doctors, police officers, engineers, corporate executives, athletes, members of the military, airline pilots and generally anyone who works productively. Conservatives who own companies hire other conservatives who want to work for a living. Liberals produce little or nothing. They like to govern the producers and decide what to do with the production. Liberals believe Europeans are more enlightened than Americans. That is why most of the liberals remained in Europe when conservatives were coming to America .. They crept in after the Wild West was tamed and created a business of trying to get more for nothing. Here ends today's lesson in world history: It should be noted that a Liberal may have a momentary urge to angrily respond to the above before sharing it. A Conservative will simply laugh and be so convinced of the absolute truth of this history that it will be forwarded immediately to other true believers and to more liberals just to #$%$ them off. And there you have it. Let your next action reveal your true self. I'm going to have a beer.</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1355929428199</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 10:03:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355930154287-26</Id><Topic><Title>GUN STOCKS ALL DOWN BIG</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355927584995</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 09:33:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junior doesn't have a clue.

In a press release explaining its decision, Time’s editorial board wrote, “Even though his quest for the Presidency was unsuccessful, Mr. Romney’s ideas about foreign policy, taxation, wealth inequality, and women’s rights typified the year 1912 as no one else has.” In giving Mr. Romney the nod, Time said that he beat out such other candidates for Man of the Year 1912 as Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, and Edward Smith, captain of the Titanic. “It was very close between but Romney and the Titanic guy, but we gave it to Romney because it took him slightly longer to sink,” Time wrote. Mr. Romney could not be reached for comment, a spokesman said, because he was travelling around the world visiting his money. .</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355941751456</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 13:29:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355942063898-99</Id><Topic><Title>Check this out.</Title><Username>edwardslaurie837</Username><Timestamp>1355938558982</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 12:35:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>interesting</Msg><Username>lisaevans254</Username><Timestamp>1355942063898</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 13:34:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355942549196-100</Id><Topic><Title>Time names man of the year</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355941751456</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 13:29:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TYPICAL Far Left rag whose days are numbered because NOBODY reads them anymore.

It's ok though: The CSCO board LOVES to hear his mewling protestations of victory. He's a riot, a laugh a minute. (1) Wanna know what's wrong with the statement "[X] don't/doesn't kill people, PEOPLE kill people?" Well, here's one thing: the logical thrust, if accepted indiscriminately, applies to anything and everything. For example: Hand grenades don't kill people, PEOPLE kill people." "Sarin nerve gas doesn't kill people, PEOPLE kill people." "Thermonuclear weapons don't kill people, PEOPLE kill people."* And you would have us conclude, I suppose, that this is irrefutable evidence of the wrong-headedness of laws against private possession of hand grenades, nerve gas and nukes? Didn't the U.S., at some time in its distant primordial past, fight a couple or three wars over just this issue? (2) Wanna know what's wrong with the further statement (dependent for its force on the underwhelming claim in (1)): "If you're going to try to ban [X] (which, as previously and irrefutably established don't/doesn't kill people, since PEOPLE actually kill people)m then why don't you ban [Y] (which if not entirely innocuous, most people would agree is a LESSER threat than [X])?" This one is pretty easy to deal with, since it's usually (and especially when used for rhetorical effect) based on false equivalency. It fails to acknowledge (or perhaps even to realize) that, while A GREAT MANY things might arguably increase the risk of violence or of accidental injury/death under certain circumstances, and while MANY OTHER things might perhaps with greater or lesser ingenuity be USED as a weapon (a well-placed banana peel, for example), firearms have certain qualitative - and often certain quantitative - characteristics that make them inordinately EFFICIENT at causing injury and/or death, when used as intended, AND IN FACT, THIS IS THEIR PRIMARY PURPOSE (but see (3)). (3) Some also claim (a) that widespread firearm ownership has a deterrent effect, (b) that this deterrent effect is almost entirely a POSITIVE one for society, or at least (c) that the POSITIVE societal impact of this deterrent effect outweighs any concomitant NEGATIVE impact. To which I would say, feel free to continue to argue this, as I'm sure you will, loudly and reflexively. But don't be surprised if your fellow citizens do not feel themselves constrained to agree with your conclusions. -------------------------------- *Or even: "Murderous rampaging cyborgs from the future don't kill people, TWISTED PROGRAMMERS AND CYBERNETICISTS, AND WAYWARD PHYSICISTS SPECIALIZING IN SEEMINGLY UNPRODUCTIVE CLOSED TIMELIKE CURVE RESEARCH kill people."</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1355952198285</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:23:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355952240480-191</Id><Topic><Title>The War Bush Wanted, the Lies He Needed</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355951948334</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:19:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>too funny Yahoo edited out Cheney's first name, LOL</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355952240480</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:24:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355952322280-192</Id><Topic><Title>Teabillys and TERRORISTS_will NEVER have a rational discussion about gun laws &amp; the 2nd Amendment</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355952199540</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:23:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the tide has turned, we will start taking the guns out of the hands of the mouth breathers now</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355952322280</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 16:25:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355952892776-193</Id><Topic><Title>he Downing Street Memos state that intelligence and facts were "fixed" to provide a basis for Bush to wage war on Iraq.

Women really are worse drivers than men, for example. A study published in 1998 by the Johns Hopkins schools of medicine and public health revealed that women clocked 5.7 auto accidents per million miles driven, in contrast to men's 5.1, even though men drive about 74 percent more miles a year than women. The only good news was that women tended to take fewer driving risks than men, so their crashes were only a third as likely to be fatal. Those statistics were reinforced by a study released by the University of London in January showing that women and gay men perform more poorly than heterosexual men at tasks involving navigation and spatial awareness, both crucial to good driving. (read that carefully, she compares auto accidents per miles driven, then says and men drive more miles!! Hello McFly yes most accidents occur close to the home, all those highway miles men drive in their trucks bringing things to walmart probably reduce their accidents per mile.) The theory that women are the dumber sex -- or at least the sex that gets into more car accidents -- is amply supported by neurological and standardized-testing evidence. Men's and women's brains not only look different, but men's brains are bigger than women's (even adjusting for men's generally bigger body size). One has to admit, if there is an argument for women being dumber then men Charlotte Allen is exhibit number one.

Northpoint N.C. After days of silence, including taking down its web site, the NRA has finally issued a statement on the Sandy Hook shootings. Speaking in front of a press core of 28 Fox News reporters NRA President David Keene said "We at the NRA share the nations grief at the senseless tragedy that has occurred in Newtown Connecticut, but we ask the country in this time of sadness to react in a reasonable fashion that doesn't back lash against American freedoms. As sad as it is that 20 children and 8 adults perished we need to honor them as patriots that have helped defend our constitutional rights to have fun with our guns. In every war there is collateral damage. As much as we appreciate the suffering of these children's families we rejoice that their deaths have advanced the rights of gun owners." After a few questions Mr. Keene added, "In closing I would like to thank all the NRA members who send in their dues every year, dues that have allowed me and the entire board to become comfortably wealthy. Dues which help us advance the political interests of the gun manufactures that control us and make us wealthy. Without the strength of our lobbying efforts the reaction of the people who value people over guns would overwhelm our rights to have fun with guns."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355971852472</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 21:50:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355971927548-264</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA INVESTMENT ON SOLYNDRA = 100% LOSS TO TAXPAYERS</Title><Username>eat_dog_shit_democrats</Username><Timestamp>1355970312297</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 21:25:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is why Obama should not be given a credit card.

"He had a sock full of his poop on me," the 21-year-old college student told the Pioneer Press. "It was everywhere; on my face, my hair, my clothes." The victim, requesting anonymity, said she screamed and tried to follow her attacker, but he escaped up the Austin Boulevard exit and ran northbound on Austin." "The woman, who said she has a copy of a photo of her assailant taken by a CTA security camera, described her assailant as a black man no older than mid-20s, average build, with facial hair above the mouth and on the chin. She said he wore a hooded sweatshirt and ball cap that partly obscured his face. She expressed utter disgust and outrage."

Then we could shriek and swoon and gossip and read chick lit to our hearts' content and not mind the fact that way down deep, we are . . . kind of dim.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355975507309</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 22:51:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355975559923-274</Id><Topic><Title>GOP has charlotte map out 2016 plan to capture women vote.</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355975507309</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 22:51:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you got that women deep down, deep you are kind of dim right?</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355975559923</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 22:52:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355975676370-275</Id><Topic><Title>Broadcasting lies begin taking their toll on so-called news networks</Title><Username>bullbear308</Username><Timestamp>1355958696939</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 18:11:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like FBN.

Global Warming is a scientific fact. They just can't prove that it is anywhere man created. The ocean is capable of recycling enormous amounts of carbon dioxide, and they have not dicovered it's limitations. Methane is a gas which is so light, it can exceed the gravitational pull of the earth and gas off to the galaxy.
