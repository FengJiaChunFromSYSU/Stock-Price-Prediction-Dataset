You twisted it into, "that presidential policies do not affect unemployment and the economy." Nice try unless your reading comprehension is that bad. People like these oversimplifications so their little minds can process it. Iraq was a mistake, but I remember people being all for invading Afghanistan after 9/11. Remember that? Probably not because you hate to give our fighting men and women credit, but they've made it safe here at home for the last 11 years.</Msg><Username>xtromania</Username><Timestamp>1355117808728</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 00:36:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355119513752-2</Id><Topic><Title>I Love America</Title><Username>deeperharbor</Username><Timestamp>1355038875112</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 02:41:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this facking post should be framed and place in the Archives of Congress, in Constitution Hall besides the very constitution itself, since it exposes the huge pile of bullshyte that is the demdummie party!</Msg><Username>clayveuss_johnson</Username><Timestamp>1355119513752</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 01:05:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355120279591-3</Id><Topic><Title>I Love America</Title><Username>deeperharbor</Username><Timestamp>1355038875112</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 02:41:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The repukes are obsessed with feces.

The group, led by casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, commissioned a new study showing that the cost of an average politician has soared exponentially over the past decade. While the American family has seen increases in the cost of food, health care and education, Mr. Adelson says, “those costs don’t compare with the cost of buying a politician, which has gone through the roof.” The casino billionaire points to his group’s study, which puts the cost of purchasing an average House member at two million dollars and an average senator at several times that. “And let’s say you buy a Senator like [South Carolina Senator] Jim DeMint and he decides to quit,” Mr. Adelson says. “Good luck trying to get your money back.” The Vegas magnate complains that the media has ignored billionaires’ essential role in giving jobs to politicians who would otherwise have difficulty finding “honest work of any kind.” “Billionaires are providing employment for a group of seriously incompetent and marginal people,” Mr. Adelson says. “You raise taxes on us, and who’s going to create those jobs? I really don’t think people have thought this through.” Adding insult to injury for America’s billionaires, he says, “the simple dream of someday owning a President is slipping out of reach.” “People think a billion dollars buys you a President, but they’re wrong,” he says. “It barely gets you a lemon like Mitt Romney.” .</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355138550338</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 06:22:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355138697350-9</Id><Topic><Title>2 days total fed expenses, is all the taxes on the rich will pay for</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1354908286282</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:24:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no, no, no.

Birmingham, Alabama (PRWEB) December 04, 2012 – The results of a 4 year study show that Americans who obtain their news from Fox News channel have an average IQ of 80, which represents a 20 point deficit when compared to the U.S. national average of 100. IQ, or intelligence quotient, is the international standard of assessing intelligence. Researchers at The Intelligence Institute, a conservative non-profit group, tested 5,000 people using a series of tests that measure everything from cognitive aptitude to common sense and found that people who identified themselves as Fox News viewers and ‘conservative’ had, on average, significantly lower intelligent quotients. Fox Viewers represented 2,650 members of the test group. The example used to explain similarities between less intelligent animals and less intelligent humans is pretty hilarious: Lead researcher, P. Nichols, explains, “Less intelligent animals rely on instinct when confronted by something which they do not understand. This is an ancient survival reaction all animals, including humans, exhibit. It’s a very simple phenomenon, really; think about a dog being afraid of a vacuum cleaner. He doesn’t know what a vacuum is or if it may harm him, so he becomes agitated and barks at it. Less intelligent humans do the same thing. Concepts that are too complex for them to understand, may frighten or anger them.” He continues, “Fox News’ content is presented at an elementary school level and plays directly into the fears of the less educated and less intelligent.” This is exactly how I picture Fox viewers: barking at vacuums. Unfortunately for the rest of us, “The study did not conclude if Fox News contributed to lowering IQ or if it attracts less intelligent humans.”</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355139155703</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 06:32:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355139212871-11</Id><Topic><Title>Urgent news from Billionaires</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355138550338</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 06:22:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama doesn't want the rich to control or influence society. $$$$ worshippers.</Msg><Username>bvioml123</Username><Timestamp>1355139212871</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 06:33:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355140837254-12</Id><Title>INTC dropped ~25%, so I decided to take a look at it...</Title><Msg>turns out that Cisco is a better buy than INTC even after this huge drop.

Do you think any of these people on talk radio if they’re punched in the face by a Republican nominee, do you think they would push back? No, they’re cowards. They’re bullies.

Fox President Roger Ailes has drastically limited both Rove’s and conservative commentator Dick Morris’ exposure on the network’s airwaves. New York magazine is reporting that Senior Vice President of Programming Bill Shine has ordered all show producers to get permission from network execs before booking either pundit. His explanation was a terse, “The election is over.” Both Rove and Morris were prominent on Fox’s programs in the months and weeks leading up to the November election. They were at the forefront of the anti-Obama crusade and were leading members of the don’t-trust-the-polls crowd. Two days before the election, Morris predicted that Mitt Romney would win “by a landslide” with 325 votes in the Electoral College. Rove’s detachment from reality prompted him to sketch out on a whiteboard his case against the statisticians, and prompted his now-notorious refusal to accept even Fox News’ own call that Ohio had gone to President Obama, sealing his re-election.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355177116949</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 17:05:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355177905652-204</Id><Topic><Title>crazy losing it's mouthpiece</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355177116949</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 17:05:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since none of you liberals would sink to watching FOX, why do you care who they have on?

US Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis argued that “this is just one more piece of evidence bolstering the President’s economic plan.” “The President’s critics are fond of alleging that a tax increase will hurt the economy,” Solis said. “But let’s take President Obama’s advice and ‘look at the numbers.’ The private sector appears to be relatively inefficient when it comes to job creation. Despite being allowed to keep more than half of the money they earn, private sector businesses still can’t get unemployment below 8%. Contrast this with the under 4% unemployment rate in the public sector and I think you’ll see where we ought to be putting the nation’s resources for maximum growth.” Solis maintained that “as we can see, the private sector is a major drag on the economy. If more people would see that funds are lying sterile in the hands of private sector businesses when they could be more effectively deployed by government the Republican opposition to the President’s proposed tax increases would be regarded as a criminal expropriation of what should be community property.” The Secretary expressed her hope that “the American public will rise up against the capitalist despoilers of the nation’s wealth and demand that their congressional representatives support the President’s efforts to reclaim the nation’s wealth for the benefit of the people.” In related news, at the same time that the Great Recession was reducing householder net wealth by 39%, members of congress saw their net wealth increase by 14%–greatly relieving the anxieties of Americans worried that those who govern them might have faced unspeakable hardships during the past few years.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1355186436874</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:40:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355186636309-222</Id><Topic><Title>Remember when EVERY REPUB here said MITT ROMNEY would EASILY WIN PRESIDENCY?</Title><Username>allnewquincymagoo26</Username><Timestamp>1355185128282</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:18:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the Republicans checked the fraud in the vote of the 4 key states, where 340k votes gave Obama the margin of victory.

The labor force declined by 350,000 in November, despite an increase of 191,000 in our working age population. The unprecedented decline of labor force participation under President Obama is not news. However, it also appears that millions of brain cells have dropped out of the mental labor force of America's economic analysts. How else can we account for headlines like these? "Jobs report: A pleasant surprise" (Jared Bernstein) "The employment emergency is over" (Felix Salmon) "Fiscal cliff? What fiscal cliff? No evidence in jobs numbers" (Stephen Gandel) In case anyone didn't notice, the BLS jobs report was terrible. Unemployment didn't go down in November (from 7.9% to 7.7%) as the BLS reported, it actually went up. The true unemployment rate, calculated at the labor force participation rate that existed when Bush 43 left office (65.8%), increased from 10.7% to 10.8%. This put the true unemployment rate 1.3 percentage points higher than when Obama's so-called "economic recovery" began, almost 3.5 years ago. As of November 2012, total employment was still 3.2 million below its peak, which occurred five years earlier. This is particularly ghastly, because America's working age population has increased by 11.2 million since then. Less than 1% of incremental working-age Americans have managed to get jobs since Obama took office. But wait. There's more. America moved another 246,000 jobs further away from full employment during November. We had fewer full-time jobs last month than we did in January 2005, which was almost eight years ago. Assuming that November's CPI comes in as expected (2.0% annual inflation rate), the real wages of ordinary ("production and non-supervisory") workers were 1.9% lower in November 2012 than they were in November 2010. They were also 9.0% lower than they were in November 1964, for that matter. Question: How can anyone look at something as dismal as Friday's BLS report and see anything but economic stagnation? Answer: Under Obama, economic stagnation has become the new normal. Just as fish don't know that they are wet, many economic analysts seem to have lost sight of what an economic recovery is supposed to look like. Hint: It's supposed to look like the Reagan recovery from the severe 1981-1982 recession. November 2012 marked 60 months since total employment peaked (in November 2007). At this point in the Reagan recovery (April 1986), total employment was 7.8% above the previous peak. If the Obama recovery had been as strong as Reagan's, there would be 14.8 million more Americans working right now. During Reagan's first term, the employment ratio, which is total employment divided by the working age population, rose by 0.9 percentage points. With one month to go in Obama's first term, the employment ratio has declined by an unprecedented 2.3 percentage points during his time in office. During the recent campaign, Obama sought to be identified with Bill Clinton, but during Clinton's first term, the employment ratio went up by 2.0 percentage points. Reagan produced his recovery via a combination of a strong dollar, tax cuts, and regulatory relief. Obama has continued Bush 43's weak dollar policy, but has added the Obamacare tax increases and a blizzard of new regulations. And, he has vowed to fight for even more tax increases. Not surprisingly, opposite causes produce opposite effects. From an employment point of view, there has been no economic recovery at all. On November 6, Obama won a second chance to turn the economy around, by defeating clueless conservative Mitt Romney. So, what is Obama's plan? His plan is more of the same. More of Ben Bernanke's "quantitative easing", more tax increases, and even more regulations. Oh, and don't forget the $50 billion in additional "stimulus" spending Obama wants. Part of Obama's new normal involves ignoring the staggering difference between the president's promises and the actual results delivered. Obama's $842 billion in stimulus spending was supposed to get the unemployment rate down to 5.2% by now. The actual unemployment rate in November (calculated at the labor force participation rate assumed for the stimulus plan) was 10.8%. This is not only more than twice as high as the level promised, it is higher than the 10.4% rate (calculated on the same basis) that existed when Obama signed the stimulus bill into law. So, is there any hope for the working class, and for jobless Americans that want to join the working class? As things stand right now, no, there isn't. Here's why. Right now, America is about 14.7 million jobs short of full employment. To create one average job, someone has to invest about $200,000 in nonresidential assets. Therefore, to create the additional jobs we need, someone would have to invest an additional $3.0 trillion or so in the U.S. economy. If an additional $3.0 trillion had been invested by the private sector during Obama's recovery, 3Q2012 GDP would have been $1.5 trillion, or 9.5%, higher than it actually was. Real GDP growth during those 13 calendar quarters would have averaged 5.11%, rather than the 2.21% actually achieved. By way of comparison, real GDP growth averaged 5.67% during the first 13 quarters of the Reagan recovery. Coming out of a severe recession, a sustained period of fast economic growth has been normal for America,. However, under Obama, slow growth and high joblessness has become the new normal. OK, so, who happens to have $3.0 trillion lying around, plus the knowledge and skills required to invest it wisely to create sustainable jobs? The poor? The middle class? The government? No, the investment required to transform America's stagnant jobs picture can only come from the people that actually have the money, as well as the demonstrated ability to manage capital investment. In other words, it would have to come from the hated and reviled "one percent". Obviously, "the rich" are already investing all that they are willing to invest under the current structure of incentives. Obama's plan is to do everything he can to make investment even less attractive for "the one percent" than it is now. This is why economic stagnation has become the new normal. A good measure of the driving force for "the rich" to invest in job-creating nonresidential assets is the Real Dow, which is the Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of gold. A rising Dow reflects a flow of capital into productive assets. A rising gold price indicates that capital is moving into inflation hedges. The Real Dow, which is the ratio of the two, reveals the balance between the competing investment options available to "the rich". The jobs picture will not improve until and unless the Real Dow begins a sustained rise. Unfortunately, the Real Dow ended November at 7.61. This is down by 16.6% since Obama's so-called "economic recovery" began, lower by 23.6% than when Bush 43 left office, and down by a staggering 80.6% since we last enjoyed full employment (in April 2000, under Bill Clinton). So, if you are waiting for an improvement in the employment picture, watch the Real Dow, but don't hold your breath. There will have to be big changes in policy before the jobs situation will improve significantly. Essentially, Obamunism would have to be supplanted by Reaganomics. America would have to move to a strong, stable dollar, lower taxes (especially on savings and investment), and cost-effective regulations. As things stand, the American people can look forward to more years of economic stagnation, as well more years of pretending that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Don't worry if your kids graduate from college, only to move back home and play video games in the basement.

The true unemployment rate, calculated at the labor force participation rate that existed when Bush 43 left office (65.8%), increased from 10.7% to 10.8%. This put the true unemployment rate 1.3 percentage points higher than when Obama's so-called "economic recovery" began, almost 3.5 years ago.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1355191268894</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 21:01:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355191555456-244</Id><Topic><Title>gun owners are 43 times more likely to kill themselves or a relative</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355184296924</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 19:04:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"This article based, on a single study (King County, Washington 1978-1983), is one of the most influential works in the entire gun-control debate and is presented as absolute proof that any positive self-defence benefit that guns may have is overwhelmed by the damage they do, indeed overwhelmed by the ratio of 43:1. (There were 389 gun deaths in a dwelling where the gun was kept; only 9 were self-defence homicides giving the 43:1 ratio) The study is also a textbook example of pseudo-science. This article examines how pseudo-science is made to look like real science." "A close examination of the numbers puts the “epidemic” in context. The first point is that firearms deaths are only 22.7% of all violent deaths in the study area." That is to say, 78% percent of gun owners would prefer to use knives, drownings, and poisoning, when killing a family member.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355191555456</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 21:05:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355191733853-245</Id><Title>5.4 mil less workers under Obama</Title><Msg>Friday's "Employment Situation" report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that 5.4 million Americans have dropped out of the labor force since Barack Obama took office. The labor force declined by 350,000 in November, despite an increase of 191,000 in our working age population. The unprecedented decline of labor force participation under President Obama is not news. However, it also appears that millions of brain cells have dropped out of the mental labor force of America's economic analysts. How else can we account for headlines like these?
