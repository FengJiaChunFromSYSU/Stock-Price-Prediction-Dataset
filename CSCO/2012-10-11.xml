We are due for a pullback or tread water for some time, the market has been trading on QE3 and EASY money provided by the Fed. WHEN Romney wins and the markets have digested their gains YOU WILL SEE one of the BIGGEST stock market gains in history. Business will UNLEASH the hoards of cash they have, PLUS the repatriated overseas money that Romney will give a tax break on. Since Romney won't attack business and the uncertainty is REMOVED, business will EXPLODE. Watch and LEARN how someone with some business sense schools the liberals.

(AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has described his disparaging remarks about the 47% of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes as "not elegantly stated." Now he's calling them "just completely wrong." The original remarks, secretly recorded during a fundraiser in May and posted online in September by the magazine Mother Jones, sparked intense criticism of Romney and provided fodder to those who portray him as an out-of-touch millionaire oblivious to the lives of average Americans. The remarks became a staple of Obama campaign criticism. Initially, Romney defended his view, telling reporters at a news conference shortly after the video was posted that his remarks were "not elegantly stated" and that they were spoken "off the cuff." He didn't disavow them, however, and later adopted as a response when the remarks were raised that his campaign supports "the 100% in America."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1349957126014</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 08:05:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349957559445-22</Id><Topic><Title>Here is my game plan after November 6th!</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1349956207937</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 07:50:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've been wrong, eh?

He cuts personal income tax rates by 20 percent across the board; he eliminates deductions, exclusions and credits so that the deficit does not grow; and he doesn’t make the tax code any less progressive. Unfortunately, as the Tax Policy Center has shown, only two of these planks can co-exist. Conservatives have reacted aggressively against the TPC report. It seems that Mitt’s plan should be viable: If you cut tax rates proportionally across the board, and eliminate tax deductions proportionally, it seems progressivity should be unchanged. In fact, if you eliminate tax breaks starting with the wealthy, as Romney says he would, it seems he should be able to make the tax code even more progressive. The idea is intuitive, but wrong. And it’s wrong because of something people don’t realize: The tax preferences that exist today overwhelmingly benefit people with lower and middle incomes, not the wealthy. While tax rate cuts reduce income tax burdens proportionally, as TPC notes, there aren't enough tax preferences for wealthy people to offset Romney's cuts at the top. To understand this, we can look at the IRS Statistics of Income report for 2009, the most recent year available. Tax returns reporting less than $200,000 of adjusted gross income (AGI) accounted for a total AGI of $5.86 trillion, and taxable income of $3.24 trillion. That is, deductions and exemptions amounted to 45 percent of adjusted gross income for people making under $200,000. Tax returns with more than $200,000 of AGI (the highest-earning 2.8 percent of filers) had a total of $1.96 trillion in AGI and $1.62 trillion in taxable income. For this high-income group, deductions and exemptions were just 18 percent of adjusted gross income. Put another way, filers with over $200,000 of income earned 26 percent of all personal income in 2009, but received only 12 percent of tax exemptions and deductions. If you think about it, this makes sense: Everyone gets the same $3,800 personal exemption ($3,650 in 2009). That amount shrinks as a share of your income the wealthier you get. Other deductions grow with income, but generally not as fast as your income; wealthier people have bigger mortgages, but you can only use so much real estate. The Alternative Minimum Tax also eats away at the value of deductions and exemptions for some people with high incomes. These statistics actually understate the extent to which tax preferences (at least those put on the table by Romney) favor low- and middle-income Americans. The statistics don’t include the tax exclusion for employer-provided health insurance, which shields a larger share of income from tax for middle-income people than for upper-income people. And they don’t account for the value of tax credits, which disproportionately benefit the poor and middle class. There is a large tax preference for the wealthy that does not show up in these statistics: the preferential tax rate on capital gain on dividend income. But Romney has specifically taken that off the table as a means of raising revenue. (For good reason, in my opinion, but it makes the rest of his math impossible.) That’s why Romney can't find enough tax preferences to offset his across-the- board rate cut -- unless he raises taxes on earners making under $200,000. That’s not to say we shouldn’t reduce tax preferences. It is to say that we shouldn't look to their elimination as a way to cut tax rates by 20 percent.</Msg><Username>oscar_dimwitty</Username><Timestamp>1349974731743</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 12:58:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349974816765-84</Id><Topic><Title>Poll Takers Pull OUT of FL, NC &amp; VA: Obama CAN'T Win There!</Title><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1349974677708</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 12:57:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are in bad shape when you are counting on Joe Biden to save you !!</Msg><Username>wonka9090</Username><Timestamp>1349974816765</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 13:00:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349974848088-85</Id><Title>OBAMA ADMIN BACKPEDDLING ON THEIR LUDICROUS CLAIM THAT ANTI-ISLAM FILM CAUSED AMBASSADOR STEVENS KILLING</Title><Msg>OBAMA ADMIN BACKPEDDLING ON THEIR LUDICROUS CLAIM THAT ANTI-ISLAM FILM CAUSED AMBASSADOR STEVENS KILLING In my opinion Susan Rice and all the weak left wing buffoons who wanted to appease and to apologize to the murderers of Ambassador Stevens by claiming his murder on a D rated anti-islam film should be fired.

Victor Joseph Espinoza also pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of street terrorism and denied sentencing enhancements for committing a crime for the benefit of a gang and for having an earlier strike conviction for street terrorism, Orange County District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Farrah Emami said. The 10-year-old boy was with his 19-year-old female cousin near Delhi Park shortly after 7:30 p.m. Thursday when, prosecutors say, Espinoza asked the boy if he wanted to see his gang tattoo, which was on his hand or arm. When the boy got close enough, Espinoza grabbed him, picked him up and sniffed him, police said." Undocumented imigrants like vicim Victor Joseph Espinoza are under attack.

I expect Joe to be mean and nasty and this won't change his base vote but it will turn off the undecided un-affiliated independent voters who don't like strident nasty politics. All Ryan has to do is show he belongs in the same room with a 36 year Senator and Vice President. Ryan will do this very well. Ryan has little foreign policy experience, Biden has lots but has a record of being wrong with most of his views over the years. Remember Biden was caught plagiarizing a British leaders speech.

The raid was handled by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Director of Central Intelligence Leon Panetta and others in this way because Obama had vetoed multiple earlier opportunities to attack The report comes from U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Paul E. Vallely, who retired in 1993 as deputy commanding general, Pacific Command, and has served as a senior military analyst for Fox News. He is now chairman of Stand Up America, which calls itself the standard bearer for the conservancy of the U.S. Constitution. The group has briefed the FBI, Congress, law enforcement and other agencies on terrorism and “anything that affects the life, liberty and pursuit of happiness of our citizenry and way of life.” In a column published today by WND, Vallely said a “senior and sensitive intelligence community source” affirmed to a Stand Up America research team that Obama “did not know of the raid in Abbottabad to kill Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011, until after the helicopters with SEAL Team 6 had crossed into Pakistani airspace.” The source said Obama was notified “at the golf course … which is why he was sitting in the strange sitting position in the picture that documented the White House operations room event.” The source told Stand Up America that Panetta “was the key player who organized and supported this daring raid.” “He signed the ‘execute orders’ with only a few people aware: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Adm. Bill Mullen and Gen. David Petraeus.” The source explained the White House “was closed out of the decision because the president, through Valerie Jarrett, had turned down two or three other earlier proposals.” Panetta, Vallely’s source reported, “and his covert planning team were extremely frustrated at all the denials, so saw the opportunity slipping away, as implausible as it seems.” The report said Panetta convinced his other principals to make the decision and received their full-fledged support but the president, according to the official, “remained clueless on the mission.” “This tremendously serious and sensitive information was relayed by a source who has been very frustrated with the continued dishonesty within the White House,” Vallely reported. Vallely, who served in Vietnam and retired in 1991 from the U.S. Army as deputy commanding general for the Pacific, previously has called for “We the People” to stop the nation’s “progressive socialist, treasonous death march.” He graduated from West Point and was commissioned in the Army in 1961. He served in theaters in Europe and the Pacific Rim and saw two tours of combat duty in Vietnam. CBS has reported that “Obama’s decision to send operatives after Osama bin Laden” was described by White House counter-terrorism adviser John Brennan as “one of the most gutsiest calls of any president.” However, the Mail Online in London reported a book by Richared Miniter documented that three “kill” missions were canceled by Obama in January, February and March of 2011. The SEAL mission was in May 2011. Miniter reported it was Jarrett who kept urging Obama to cancel plans to get bin Laden. The Ulsterman Report blog earlier said Obama did not make the attack decision. That blog said, “He can say he did and the people who really know what happened are inside the Pentagon, are in the military and the military isn’t allowed to speak out against the commander-in-chief so his secret is safe.”</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1349994191726</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 18:23:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349994371508-158</Id><Topic><Title>IF EVERY TRANSVESTITE IN AMERICA VOTES FOR OBAMA</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1349990575437</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 17:22:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes, it is.
