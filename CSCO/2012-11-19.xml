Posted: 18 Nov 2012 05:00 PM PST Ben Stein gets honest on Fox News with Greg Gutfeld (a Coulter wannabe), and tells him that if we go off the 'fiscal cliff' nothing bad will happen and then asks him this, "What do you care if we raise taxes on some rich person?" You gotta love it. Gutfield's response to Stein after he demands tax increases on the rich is typical Fox News stupidity. Stein: Taxes will go up on really rich people really a lot and we need it; we need more revenue. Gutfeld: Alright, boo on you, Ben. I disagree with everything you said, but you're both an actor and an economist. I kinda understand why you wanna raise taxes. It's about getting invited to more cocktail parties Without actors yelling at you. Stein: Not at all, I don't get invited to any parties and I don't drink, but look, the whole idea for being a Republican is for fiscal sensibility and fiscal sensibility says we cannot run 16 trillion debt. We can't have it up to 20 trillion. We cannot leave our grandchildren a defaulted, bankrupt America. I wonder if Greg forgot who Ben Stein is and how important his presence has been to the Fox Business Channel shows for him to treat him like he does every liberal who might cross his path. I don't agree with everything Stein says, but it's refreshing listening to a conservative try to think rationally. The idiot Gutfeld actually says America has enough revenue coming in. This is what is known as an informed host on Fox. Oh, his answer to Ben's question about taxing the rich is that he doesn't want class warfare. #$%$ does that even mean in this context?</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1353341756956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:15:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353342032026-34</Id><Topic><Title>Benny Stein says......</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1353341756956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:15:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You usually cut &amp; paste under your dumb.ivan id.

It appears that (as happens all too rarely with debtor-in-possession reorgs) he bankruptcy judge actually may have refused to approve the new Driscoll employment contract. The company then moved Driscoll aside, and replaced him with new CEO Greg Rayburn, providing Rayburn with compensation of $125000 per month, plus perks &amp; bonuses.

EW YORK (TheStreet) -- The liquidation filing of Hostess Brands -- the maker of consumer fattening favorites such as Ho Ho's and Twinkies - also means that Americans may soon gorge themselves on the company's massive pension liabilities. Hostess' liquidation -- just like the recent bankruptcies of well known companies like Friendly Ice Cream and Eddie Bauer -- raises the prospect that sophisticated private equity and distressed debt hedge fund investors are using courts to cast off unwanted pension obligations on U.S. taxpayers and put a losing investment back on the track. Consider that also on Friday, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation disclosed that its U.S. pension plan insurance deficit grew to a record $34 billion this year, the biggest shortfall in the federal agency's history. PBGC guarantees employee pension plans after a company goes belly up, securing the retirement of roughly 43 million U.S. workers.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353350410173</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:40:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353350665254-52</Id><Topic><Title>Hostess laying off 18,500 workers</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1353071396777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 08:09:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>(The company then moved Driscoll aside, and replaced him with new CEO Greg Rayburn, providing Rayburn with compensation of $125000 per month, plus perks &amp; bonuses.

BK law allows them to get rid of unions, and if a union decides to fail to negotiate, they recieve their pension allotment as a priority claim, greater than even some bondholders, AFAIK.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1353354386989</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 14:46:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353354436940-70</Id><Topic><Title>DROOLING DEMOCRATS NOW CONTROL PRESIDENCY AND SENATE...FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT?</Title><Username>walterbyrdman11</Username><Timestamp>1353351318754</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:55:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"An Israeli ground invasion would be very much in Iran's interest." Iran is shipping missiles to Hamas while they spin uranium in fortified bunkers (for peaceful purposes) so they are ready by Dec 21. A ground invasion is the only option (only a matter of time) and will force Obama to show how much he really supports Israel. So far Obama has given less lip service support for Israel than he did for cheering on the Mooslim Brotherhood's overthrow of U.S. ally Mubarak. Obama proclaimed Gadaffi must go.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353354436940</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 14:47:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353354464728-71</Id><Topic><Title>Hostess laying off 18,500 workers</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1353071396777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 08:09:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stock market rallies.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353354464728</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 14:47:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353354533677-72</Id><Title>91% TOP TAX RATE...DEMOCRATS WANT TO GO BACK TO 'THE GOOD OLD DAYS'..</Title><Msg>but wait a minute...if we do that, then the Feds get 91% of all income over 100,000 dollars.

And in fact, if they charged an actual MARKET-equivalent rate, laissez-faire shills and swindlers in general, and CEOs in particular, would scream bloody murder at the inhumanity of being charged a market rate. Also re (1), why should the union be required to insure its members against theft by the management of the very companies for which they work? When these things are found to have transpired, why not just roll responsible management up in a heavy rug and drop boardroom statuary on them until they cease to complain (RED CARPET TREATMENT), as was done with nobles of olde? Corporate executives have in fact gone to great lengths to MAINTAIN as much control as they possibly can over the fund corpus/assets which were intended and set aside to provide for worker pensions and related benefits (such as LTHBs, disability, etc.). Hmmm, now why do you think THAT might be? Re (2), I appreciate your AFAIK qualification, but note that in your case "as far as I know" isn't far at all. The PBGC has argued routinely that its claims on behalf of swindled pensioners SHOULD be given administrative priority in bankruptcy, as ERISA would seem to intend and provide, but bankruptcy judges, seeing themselves bound by adverse and highly suspect prior precedent, have just as routinely DENIED these requests, treating PBGC claims pari passu with all other "general unsecured creditors" (GUCs), which is one of the - several - major reasons why pensioners walk away with just pennies on the dollar to fund their retirement, and one of the - several - major reasons why the PBUC found itself $34 billion in the red last year.</Msg><Username>jason_baby2003</Username><Timestamp>1353357937112</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 15:45:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353357953861-103</Id><Topic><Title>Apology to the board</Title><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1353357497921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 15:38:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's very good at making a fool of himself.

Reagan wouldn't let Americans go there. Non-Muslims were not welcome, unless they were on official business, formalized through the embassy of the country of origin. The simple truth is that no young American would have been able to visit Pakistan in 1981, unless he was on official U.S. government business of which the State Department was aware. Young Barack Obama was not on government business. He had no business in Pakistan. Only a Muslim non-American could get into Pakistan. Watch the movie Argo. Obama traveled as a Muslim on an Indonesian passport to Pakistan in 1981. He was adopted by Lolo Soetoro, an Indonesian Muslim, he attended school in Jakarta, and his school records list his religion as Muslim. Barack Obama was a citizen of Indonesia, by virtue of adoption, and possibly maintained both his citizenship and his passport for many years – or at least long enough to travel to Pakistan in 1981. Indonesia does not allow dual citizenship. Obama played the name game. He had two names. He is a con man. Hillary is getting off the sinking ship. Petraeus has the CIA info. He gave the classified documents to Paula.

Has such a deadly lack of leadership ever emanated from the White House? Further, what impact will such brutal official indifference make upon the American psyche if this event is not harshly sanctioned at the voting booth? Benghazi 9/11 Overview Here is a brief description of what we know: US Ambassador Christopher Stevens traveled from Tripoli to Benghazi, Libya. Nervous over rising unrest in this Muslim African Mediterranean nation, Stevens asked repeatedly for more security but was refused. On the day of the attack he’d asked again. He was attacked after dark, and seven hours later he was dead, along with three others. And it now appears the US had notice of the event, time to respond, and resources within reach to mount a counter-assault. What is not clear is why the American military was not sent in to save our Ambassador. (The time-line of the attack is well laid out at Powerline. (Benghazigate: The state of the story) Benghazi Obama Problems But let’s recall some of the more unsavory elements of the Benghazi charade. The killing of Stevens occurred on September 11, 2012 after 9 pm. As we now know, the attack was prep-planned terrorism, not the result of any video protest, as the White House (WH) initially claimed. The assault pitted a large group of terrorists against a few Americans and some Libyan security guards, who fled almost immediately. Four Americans were killed. After much WH disinformation, we now know a great deal of damning information about what actually happened: The fight raged for 7 hours; the WH knew there was no video protest; Ambassador Stevens asked repeatedly for more security, including the day of the attack; the WH had a live feed for 5 hours of the firefight; there was a CIA safe house 1 mile down the road; A nearby US base was 480 miles away—Sigonella Naval Air Station in Sicily, Italy; Former Navy SEALS at the nearby (1 mile) CIA annex asked three times if they could help Stevens and were told repeatedly to “stand down”; several agents finally volunteered to aid Stevens and ended up dying; that a Delta Force Team, designated a secret tier-one counter-terrorism team, was at Sigonella, at most 2 hours away; a US Military AC-130h-Specter Gunship was already in Benghazi but not sent to rescue Stevens (gunships mission: “close air support, air interdiction and armed reconnaissance”); that a strike was organized, the terrorists located, but the mission canceled when Barack did not have the nerve to pull the trigger. It is undoubtedly worse than Obama simply turned his back on cornered American citizens in a foreign land, knowing undoubtedly they would die. But that Barack did so without any compelling reason—except political—is beyond evil. Only a moral monster would have made that decision when it was within his powers to possibly save them with almost no effort of his own.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353363894149</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:24:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353363926342-151</Id><Title>Goodbye Tom</Title><Msg>Congress zeroing in on Tom Donilon from the NSC as the person who edited Petraeus's memo.

This is the uncaring, craftily ambitious, inexperienced yet know-it-all poseur. But, when storm clouds mount he is so unnerved by making big decisions he sprints to the sand to bury his head. This can be seen the way Obama reacted to the Gulf Oil Spill. His most memorable maneuver, after lecturing oil companies on safety, was golf. Bill Clinton offered more leadership suggesting we nuke the offending undersea oil gusher. Hypocritical &amp; Soulless Politician Third, Obama’s loss of nerve and decision to call off a military strike that could have taken out the Benghazi insurgents, and instead—just letting Americans die an agonizing, lonely death—is the most quintessential aspect of the story. This is because it reveals Barack as he truly is inside—an immoral, gutless, unfeeling, selfish, hypocritical, overly ambitious and hideously uncaring person. Obama ONLY cares about what he personally finds valuable, which obviously does not include individual Americans, or any random human beings.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353364159919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:29:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353364168855-154</Id><Topic><Title>Goodbye Tom</Title><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1353363926342</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:25:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wonder why Hilary resigned?

McCain said the situation conflicts with the White House “narrative” of a diminished al Qaeda influence in the Middle East. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C,) voiced a similar sentiment on NBC’s “Meet the Press:” “Isn’t it kind of an odd reason to take al Qaeda out of the equation when the story they told helps the president enormously before the election?” Former CIA Director David Petraeus told lawmakers in closed-door briefings on Friday that he told Congress in the days after the Sept. 11 attack that killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans that there was “significant terrorist involvement,” according to reports citing unnamed members of Congress who attended the briefing U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice has recently come under fire initially saying the Benghazi attack was sparked by spontaneous protests, rather than a planned terrorist attack. On Sunday, Graham said he blamed Obama more than anyone else, calling Rice, viewed as a top contender to replace Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a “bit player here.” Clinton has indicated she plans to leave her post early next year.

Back pursuing Obama’s ‘missing link‘ in the visit to Pakistan in 1981, it was necessary to revisit Zbigniew Brzezinski’s activities, roles and positions at the time. “ZB” is a soviet specialist and ‘widely consulted’ on the political affairs inside communist countries. Brzezinski has the ‘necessary ingredients’ of the ‘thread’ that links to Obama’s hidden history: a professor at Columbia University (1960-1989); ties to the CIA; Carter’s national security advisor, currently key advisor to Obama, and a master at the game of ‘geopolitics‘ and how those forces can be manipulated for strategic gain. ZB’s hatred for the Soviet Union, and now Russia, is legendary. Anwar Sadat 1918-1981 During Brzezinski’s visit to Pakistan in the spring of 1981, Obama also happened to be visiting Pakistan on spring break, just after having entered Columbia University, and supposedly visiting his mother (working for the Ford Foundation) in Lahore, and later ‘hunting partridge’ in the country side. Right. ZB’s activities had been focused on breaking apart the Soviet Union and using CIA and U.S. military assets to create chaos and instability. In Afghanistan, the goal was to provoke the Soviet Union into invading, and to provide weapons, training and other support to the Muslim Mujahadeen and to demoralize the Soviet army in an unwinnable fight. Remember also that at this time, the Muslim Brotherhood, which had been established in Egypt, had already established itself in Pakistan and Afghanistan. ZB, of course, was not just setting up attacks against the Soviet Union via arming radical Muslims. As is well known, ZB became the first director of the Trilateral Commission which emerged during this critical period in the 1970s. He drafted it’s charter and became it’s strongest proponent. ZB called for the ‘deliberate management of the American future, a community of nations, and a world government’. The funding for this enterprise came from the Charles F. Kettering Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and Rockefeller. Obama's mother Ann Dunham traveled to Pakistan for the Ford Foundation. The U.S. Role in Arming Bin Ladin The goal of ZB’s efforts was to create a ‘arc of chaos’ in Muslim countries as a hedge against Soviet influence. To do this, the CIA had to arm insurgents at the expense of stability in these countries. As we also know, the goals also included strategic access to oil reserves and the design of systems to serve Europe, and not the Soviet Union or China. Access to this area was critical to the strategic construction of oil pipelines through the region to serve western interests.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353365577274</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:52:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353365818345-166</Id><Topic><Title>funnier</Title><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1353344162465</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 11:56:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump</Msg><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1353365818345</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:56:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353365882824-167</Id><Topic><Title>Junior to boycott San Francisco</Title><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1353353602335</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 14:33:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I remember carter. The college kids got him elected and chose him for his SMILE even though he was a peanut farmer with no experience. Sound familiar? I remember standing in employment lines that wound around the block and no hope for jobs with no end in site. I remember when manufacturing jobs that could support a family on one paycheck in the area I lived in then went the way of the dinosaur after having been established since the late 1800′s. Those wonderful brick buildings (linen mills) now house flea markets and the like. Those well paying jobs went to China. I remember the gas rationing and the odd, even number system that was in place for the rationing along with new controls in place and demanding GM manufacture smaller cars. After they complied there suddenly was no shortage of gas. I remember the end of the Viet Nam war where the guys came home and were given zero assistance and ended up mentally ill and homeless. It’s like an old broken record that keeps on going. Yes, sounds like the same old Brezinski stance.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353365882824</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:58:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353366082730-168</Id><Topic><Title>Goodbye Tom</Title><Username>banjobob45</Username><Timestamp>1353363926342</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 17:25:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We need a Real Democrat in the White House -- Hillary 2016.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353366082730</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 18:01:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353366286183-169</Id><Topic><Title>The last dinosaur died about 650,000,000 years before the FIRST HUMAN APPEARED</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1353354105371</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 14:41:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama, President of the Blue Parasite counties, spix, nggrs and illegal aliens.

Diversity is hog crap and not worth a hill of goat poop. Now anyone else who wants to enjoy the fruits of America should understand where it came from and how it got to be the way it is. It wasn't created by Mexicans, but they were a part of it. Mexico is what Mexicans create. How's that going? Italians, and Germans and French, and English and Swedes and Russians and Dutch folks built America.....Africans helped, but against their will as slaves...Africa as a continent and as nations is a joke. Africans are great folks, but tolerate the most abusive government systems, sort of like Democrats...some Democrats are wonderful people, most are sniveling whiners, who want a corrupt system like Chicago, which works to their benefit at the expense of integrity, and honesty and productivity.....CHICAGO CREEPS.....Poles helped build America though, even Chicago corrupt......
