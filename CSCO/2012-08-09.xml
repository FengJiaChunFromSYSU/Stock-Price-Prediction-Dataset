He placed me on block user today because I offended his ego saying a Bear on Cisco these past few days could really tear up a bag full of Reese's and gain 10 or so pounds. He probably has gained those ten pounds doing just that as he's a proud member of the Reese's family with an agenda. I firmly believe people should not speak from their agenda as though it were rational. A rational thought is just that, rational. A lie to support an agenda makes the liar a slave to that agenda living a fake reality and being a slave to it.</Msg><Username>scott4usa</Username><Timestamp>1344485816790</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 00:16:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344498091752-2</Id><Topic><Title>Fox says the rich will leave the country if taxed too much</Title><Username>virtualgh0st</Username><Timestamp>1344477094298</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:51:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Someone said "Who is the supreme re/tard, ?"and flute waved his hands like a cruise ship tourist.

Jensen writes his survey of resellers at the end of June showed Cisco “above plan,” which was better than some competitors such as Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Aruba Networks (ARUN): At the end of the June quarter, we conducted a networking survey and collected feedback from VARs and distributors throughout North American and Europe. We note that at this point, there was still a month remaining in Cisco’s July quarter, but nonetheless, Cisco was the clear outperformer in the group comprised of Cisco, Juniper, [Hewlett-Packard (HPQ)] Networking, Brocade, and Aruba. Looking at the results, 42% of resellers were above plan versus 45% from last quarter. Cisco’s UCS and their network security products stood out in terms of what drove demand in the quarter. Based on conversations with other industry contacts since this survey was conducted, we believe Cisco’s favorable execution continued in the month of July. The following exhibit highlights the June quarter survey results by vendor. For the October quarter and the year, Jensen thinks the company will be cautious regarding weakness in Europe and the continued slump in federal spending, while citing growing bandwidth demand; his own view is that telco spending on equipment will be better in the second half than the first. As far as the longer-term outlook, We believe CSCO’s stock will work higher with investor interest in networking stocks returning and estimates likely moving higher (accretive acquisition and cost controls). We also believe CSCO’s stock offers downside protection if markets turn negative with an attractive valuation (5.5x CY13 EPS ex-cash) and nearly 2% dividend yield. G Jensen also raised his year estimate to $50.5 billion and from $49.3 billion, while maintaining an EPS projection of $1.84. Cisco shares today rose 2 cents to close at $17.16.</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1344504717629</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 05:31:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344508353461-5</Id><Title>WOW, upgraded before earnings and PT raised to $22!</Title><Msg>now, that is one brave analyst.

I just UNLOADED everything at $17.65 and above. The last time in mid June they did the same thing as we inched up to $17.60, I warned everyone then as I UNLOADED my shares and over the next 45 days we fell down to the $15 level. I reloaded over that time period with the last HUGE buy just above $15 which I just UNLOADED again. This is why there is no such thing as buy and hold anymore. I will now wait for the CC for guidance. Why take the risk when I already have substantial profits.
