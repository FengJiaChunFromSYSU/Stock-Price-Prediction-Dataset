Famous cliff scene from the movie "Thelma &amp; Louise." If you guessed either Japan or the United States, both would be the correct answer. This week, the similarities between two of the world’s economic heavyweights became more apparent, with both starting to resemble ugly twin sisters. Japan reported a surprisingly deep 0.9 percent contraction in the third quarter, the first time in the year. Meanwhile, initial jobless claims in the U.S. surged to their highest in more than a year, and a clutch of companies announced mass layoffs – the latest sign of how slowly the economy is growing With the world fixated on the euro zone’s debt troubles, Japan this week provided a stark reminder that it's vast economy remains a basket case, right alongside Europe and the United States. “It’s the U.S. to Europe that’s the best comparison, but in terms of levels of debt, comparing debt proximity to the ceiling, then it’s a U.S.-Japan race,” said Andrew Wilkinson, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak. Obama has really put the U.S. on a hole quickly. As anti-austerity strikes and a deepening recession roil the 17-nation euro club, most economists are quick to point to Continental Europe as an emblem of what ails America: too much debt, sluggish growth and political paralysis. However, with Japan’s “Lost Decade” stretching into a generation, the is following the same path under Obama. Both countries have debt levels that match or exceed their gross domestic product. In Japan, runaway public spending has pushed its debt to GDP ratio above 200 percent, while the U.S. just recently topped 100 percent. The state of affairs has ratings agencies ready to downgrade both governments. Fair value for Dow is 7500.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1353252261014</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 10:24:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353253226227-18</Id><Topic><Title>THE TONE OF DEMOQUACKS IS ALREADY DEFENSIVE OF OBAMA!</Title><Username>maxedout333</Username><Timestamp>1353206413054</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 21:40:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ahead of the election, Mitt Romney scored well on economic issues – with many polls saying Romney was viewed as better for the economy than Barack Obama. It appears Democrats in the Senate and House are going to implement the Romney Plan. Obama has no plan. The plan presented by Romney and embraced by the GOP to cap deductions appears to be gaining traction despite Romney’s loss. Back on October 2nd Mitt Romney began talking about stemming the budget crisis and the resulting fiscal cliff by reducing income tax deductions to a flat $17,000. Ironically, when Mr. Romney presented the idea it was ridiculed by President Obama as window dressing to a “sketchy deal.” Obama is a stupid farking nggr. However, Republicans and Democrats now see it as the only way out. The change of tone comes as Democrats returned to Washington after the election and were immediately confronted by incendiary rhetoric from President Obama in which he insisted that Bush-era tax cuts end permanently for people making over $250,000.

I do so because I’m deeply troubled by how the Jewish community is being flooded with inaccurate and sometimes inflammatory attacks on President Obama, claiming that he is not a strong supporter of Israel. I do so because as a Jewish senator and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I feel a responsibility to share what I have personally seen and what I know about Barack Obama and Israel. As I write this, U.S. and Israeli forces are engaged in a large joint military exercise. We hold these exercises regularly. But this is the largest joint exercise we have held with Israel, involving over 3,500 U.S. troops, about 1/3 of them deployed to Israel for 3 weeks. This exercise comes at a critical moment for putting massive pressure on Iran to end any quest for a nuclear weapon. The joint exercise will dramatize our joint military capability to defend against an Iranian missile attack. The exercise combines U.S. Patriot batteries and Aegis ship radar with Israel’s Arrow, Iron Dome and David’s Sling missile defenses. These Israeli missile defenses received significant funding by the U.S. and have been strongly supported by President Obama. As Iran decides whether to try to build a nuclear weapon, Iranian leaders will now have to factor in more than ever that they will not be able to deter a strike against a nuclear weapon facility by threatening to retaliate with their missiles. Iran’s leaders can’t do so because a retaliatory threat by them or by their allies Hezbollah or Hamas has been degraded by Israel’s and our combined missile defenses, as demonstrated by the current joint exercise. I have seen up close how President Obama has acted in many other ways to strengthen Israel’s military capability. Ehud Barak, Israel’s current Defense Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, recently put it this way: “I should tell you honestly that this Administration, under President Obama, is dong in regard to our security more than anything I can remember in the past.” (July 11, 2012) Prime Minister Netanyahu himself told the AIPAC Conference in May of this year: “Our security cooperation is unprecedented. And President Obama has backed his words with deeds.” President Obama has also made clear that he will not permit Iran to get a nuclear weapon. For instance: “It’s my firm belief that an Iran with a nuclear weapon would pose a security threat not only to the region but also to the United States.” (November 14, 2011) “My policy here is not going to be one of containment. My policy is prevention of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons. And as I indicated yesterday in my speech, when I say all options are at the table, I mean it.” (March 5, 2012) Iran must know from the record of President Obama, including his use of force in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen and Somalia, that he doesn’t bluff or bluster. He is a serious man. He speaks carefully. He doesn’t flip flop around. He doesn’t throw words around carelessly. Iran has seen him act – his warnings aren’t idle threats. President Obama has succeeded in unifying the world against Iran with biting sanctions. Those sanctions have done major damage to Iran’s oil revenues (they are down by 60% over the last year) and to its currency (the value of which is down by 80% over the last year). In part because of the respect in which he is held around the world, he has also succeeded in the challenging environment at the UN in preventing unfair damage to Israel at a number of crucial moments, including stopping a UN condemnation of Israel when it prevented a flotilla of ships from forcing itself through its blockade of Gaza. President Reagan is rightly remembered as a strong friend of Israel, although he led the world’s condemnation of Israel at the UN when Israel knocked out Iraq’s threatening nuclear facility. I’m amazed how some in our community judge President Obama, who has prevented unfair condemnation of Israel at the UN, by a different standard. I have seen President Obama act forcefully to protect Israeli citizens at Israel’s embassy in Cairo when a violent mob recently came within minutes of reaching and attacking them. Here is what Prime Minister Netanyahu said about President Obama’s actions: “I requested President Obama’s assistance at a decisive – I would even say fateful – moment. He said he would do everything possible, and this is what he did. He activated all of United States’ means and influence – which are certainly considerable. I believe we owe him a special debt of gratitude.” By any standard, fairly and consistently applied, President Obama has been a proven friend of Israel. Support for a strong U.S.-Israel relationship has been bipartisan, and it is essential it remain so for our security and for Israel’s security. It is harmful to that relationship and to Israel for some in our community to attempt to drive a wedge between the Obama administration and Israel. I won’t comment here on the many other reasons I support President Obama. My goal is to simply express my abhorrence at blatantly unfair, inaccurate and sometimes inflammatory claims that President Obama is not a strong supporter of the U.S. – Israel relationship, when that relationship is important to U.S. security and to the goal of Middle East peace. I hope that this effort will succeed in utilizing the internet’s ability to have one’s thoughts shared broadly. If you believe they are worthy or interesting, please share them with your friends. Thanks.

And frankly I don’t think that’s why Republicans lost the election," Gutierrez said during an appearance on CNN’s "State of the Union." "I think we lost the election because the far right of this party has taken the party to a place that it doesn’t belong." Romney's remarks, made last week in a post-election conference call with donors, sparked Democratic outrage, with even top Republican operatives repudiating the 2012 Republican nominee. Second-term Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal -- the first Indian-American to be elected governor -- told reporters at the Republican Governors Association annual meeting in Las Vegas that he "absolutely reject[s] that notion, that description." Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has sought distance from Romney after the controversial remarks. Now Gutierrez, a former businessman and director of Romney's Hispanic outreach, is piling on. "I don’t know if he understood that he was saying something that was insulting," Gutierrez told Candy Crowley. "The language, the attitude, the body language, that’s what Latinos watch."</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353275603100</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 16:53:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353275679371-44</Id><Title>"I think we lost the election because the far right of this party has taken the party to a place that it doesn’t belong."</Title><Msg>that's what happens when you let the crazies take control, Rush, Beck, Coulter all the loonies</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1353275679371</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 16:54:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353279299262-45</Id><Title>14 kids murdered, 1,400 more terrorist created, to bad the #$%$ never got the memo from jesus</Title><Msg>At least 26 people were reported to have been killed in Gaza by Israeli bombardments on Sunday.
