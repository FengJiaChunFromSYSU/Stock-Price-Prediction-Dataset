The one that got his mother pregnant. Which john is your real father. I bet your mother could only give you a list of possible fathers. 2. Yes he was born in the USA. Hawaii became a state 6 years before he was born. 3. Stupid question. Harvard gives scholarships for room, board, tuition, flights to Harvard, and spending money. There are also scholarships from NAACP and other places. Besides this there are Stafford, GSL Loans, Plus, and many other loans. 4. Why should he show them? 5. You need to change your grammar for this one. It is awkwardly posed. How do you know he hasn't? 6.

Did you know that it can also teach you things that you never wanted to know and now not-so-secretly wish you didn’t? I am referring to a recent study out of the U.C.L.A. Department of Psychology that determined that the women of the Grand Old Party have more feminine faces than those of their female Democratic colleagues. In conducting the study, researchers analyzed the faces of the House of Representatives in the 111th Congress based on objective measures of feminine facial structure. The faces were then rated according to gender-typical femininity, and shown to undergraduate students, who (in exchange for course credit) were asked to judge which political party they thought each face was affiliated with. The students guessed correctly with surprising accuracy. The resulting data suggested that the more conservative a female politician is, the more likely her face will conform to subtleties that are considered typically feminine. The flip side being that more liberal female politicians tend to have less feminine facial structures. As in: they’re more masculine, I guess. As in: terrific. The researchers call it the “Michele Bachmann Effect.” Funny, but that’s exactly how I refer to the tingly feeling that overtakes me when I read or hear something so profoundly ridiculous that I briefly consider living the rest of my life in monkish isolation on a mountaintop with only the cold wind for companionship. Listen, anybody who has ever attended the Democratic National Convention knows that Democratic women prefer flats over heels, by an estimated ratio of 10 to 1. After all, if the sensible shoe fits... But this is anecdotal. It’s the type of research done after three days of being yelled at on the convention floor by people in 10-gallon hats, with only a steady diet of Coke Zero and SunChips to keep you upright. You’re punchy. Who can blame you for slumping on the floor outside a women’s washroom and counting people’s feet as they go by? But this U.C.L.A. study contains measurable scientific data collected by actual professional scientists who have just basically given us the green light to go ahead and judge a book by its cover. And though the data offered no evidence as to the relative “attractiveness” of either party’s representatives (as the face-modeling software controlled for superficial markers like makeup and hairstyles), why would that stop anyone from conflating gender typicality with sex appeal? The answer is ha ha, of course it wouldn’t, but I adore your innocence. I can’t figure out which part of this story is the most unforgivably retro. Is it the part where the Internet is flooded by a tsunami of bickering over which political party has the “prettier” members of Congress and/or prettier voters? Followed by smug accusations of sour grapes, actual sour grapes, and finally resentful grumbling by lots of women in comfort clogs, maybe even including me. (It’s none of your business but I require them for the back support. Take it easy, I have a doctor’s note.) Or is it the part that suggests that a key factor in the electability and, dare I say, presence of a female politician on a national stage can be dependent on something as random as the placement of her eyebrows? Are there really subtle ways in which people would consider a woman suitable for office that are rooted in their visceral reaction to the width and prominence of her cheekbones? Well, probably. All I know is that once I finished reading the study I’m pretty sure 1970s Burt Reynolds reached across the passenger seat of his Trans Am to give me a wink and a boob honk. Thankfully, the “sex typical” phenomenon applies only to female members of Congress. When it comes to male members of Congress, the results of the study are somewhat less conclusive. So guys, feel free to go to work on behalf of your constituents without wondering for a second whether psych undergrads around the country are hotly debating whether or not you got hit at birth with an ugly stick. Don’t you worry your pretty little man-heads about it. In the end, of course, it’s hard to know what the take-away is for voters: What should bother us more — that a scholarly journal decided to float this information out into the pre-election maelstrom of partisan nastiness or that some people will relish the findings and distribute the study as a voting guide? Perhaps over time the answer — and the usefulness of this research — will reveal itself. But until that comes to pass, perhaps science could take a crack at something I can use right now, like time manipulation, since I can’t help but yearn for the person I was before reading this study. The person not compelled to consider the possibility that her own facial structure could be construed as “mannish.” By a certain light.

Sept. 11th was surely one of the most defining and poignant moments in American history. The events of that day have been rehashed in countless television specials and documentaries, but in 2013 audiences can expect something different. A 9/11 "truther" fim titled "September Morn" is set to hit theaters and it has two big Hollywood names at the helm. Martin Sheen and Woody Harrelson will star in the 9/11 truther flick, according to Yahoo! Movies. The film will focus on some of the theories presented by the truther movement, a coalition of individuals who believe that the mainstream media has deceived the public about what really happened on Sept. 11, 2001. "September Morn" has been described in an advanced publicity note (via IMDb): "We the people demand that the government revisit and initiates a thorough and independent investigation to the tragic events of 911. In the vein of '12 Angry Men' this dramatic piece is set with a stellar and award winning cast." In 2007, Sheen first expressed doubt over the true events of 9/11. “I did not want to believe that my government could possibly be involved in such a thing, I could not live in a country that I thought could do that – that would be the ultimate betrayal,” he said during a 2007 appearance at We Are Change L.A. “There have been so many revelations that now I have my doubts, and chief among them is Building 7 –- how did they rig that building so that it came down on the evening of the day?” The actor was alerted to the "inconsistencies" in the collapse of 7 World Trade Center, the cornerstone of September 11th conspiracy theories, by his son Charlie, according to Yahoo!. Harrelson and actor Ed Asner, who will also appear in the film, have aligned themselves with the truther movement as well, according to the Guardian. Indie Wire reports that the 9/11 conspiracy film is set to be directed by BJ Davis, whose resume includes "Charlie Sheen's Stunt Spectacular" and "Forget About It." It will be produced by John D. Schofield. The film will be shot in one location, similar to "12 Angry Men," according to Indie Wire.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1350850381991</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:13:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350850463398-40</Id><Title>junior and his numerous IDs posting to each other</Title><Msg>How pathetic</Msg><Username>craypark</Username><Timestamp>1350850463398</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:14:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350850495707-41</Id><Topic><Title>Al Queda endorses Romney.</Title><Username>tfhddg</Username><Timestamp>1350812890114</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 05:48:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bush's Saudi Bin Laden connection sending money to Romney - da Traitor.</Msg><Username>superdupershortysporty</Username><Timestamp>1350850495707</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 16:14:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350850582935-42</Id><Topic><Title>AntiAmerican Romney Smiles When He Talks About Al Qaeda's Lybian Attack</Title><Username>superdupershortysporty</Username><Timestamp>1350782342104</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 21:19:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still no reply, you cowardly Repubs.

From "The Blaze" news website: "Bryan County sixth grader Kendra St. Clair told ABC News she was home alone when there was a loud banging on the door, followed by glass shattering and the intruder entering the house. Terrified, Kendra called her mom, who told her to get the gun and hide in the closet. “I said you go get the gun and you get in my closet right now and you call 911,” Debra St. Klair told KFOR-TV. Kendra was in the closet, on the phone with the 911 dispatcher and gripping the .40 caliber Glock when she saw the closet doorknob start to turn. “I was sitting there in the closet really scared, not knowing what was gonna happen,” Kendra told KFOR. “When he turned the door handle I shot toward him with my mom’s gun and it hit him right here in the arm.” It was the first time Kendra had ever fired a gun. Police said the bullet traveled through the closet door and struck 32-year-old Stacy Jones in the shoulder, prompting him to flee from the house."

From "The Blaze" news website: "President Barack Obama in 2010 spoke at LG Chem subsidiary Compact Power, an electric battery plant in Holland, Mich., to tout his administration’s decision to pour millions and millions of taxpayer’s dollars into the clean energy industry. “Our goal has never been to create a government program, but rather to unleash private-sector growth,” Obama said. “And we’re seeing results.” “This is a symbol of where Michigan’s going. This is a symbol of where Holland is going. This is a symbol of where America is going,” he added. Much like Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod’s premature Nats gloat tweet, the president’s 2010 Holland speech seems pretty ominous in retrospect. Why? Because, according to a new report from Target 8, that same electric battery company President Obama spoke at in 2010 is an unmitigated disaster and a shameful waste of tax dollars. For starters, there’s no work to be done. Employees, who are being paid with the $150 million the Department of Energy awarded the plant, claim they show up and sit around because there’s nothing to do. It has gotten to the point where employees spend most of their time playing cards and/or board games and watching movies to keep themselves entertained. “There would be up to 40 of us that would just sit in there during the day,” one former LG Chem employee Nicole Merryman, who said she quit in May, told Target 8. “We were given assignments to go outside and clean; if we weren’t cleaning outside, we were cleaning inside. If there was nothing for us to do, we would study in the cafeteria, or we would sit and play cards, sit and read magazines,” she added. “It’s really sad that all these people are sitting there and doing nothing, and it’s basically on taxpayer money.” Two current employees claim the idling among workers continues because there’s nothing else to do. “There’s a whole bunch of people, a whole bunch, filling their time with card games and board games,” one these current employee said. “There’s no work, no work at all. Zero work,” another current employee added. “It is what it is. What do you do when there’s no work?”"</Msg><Username>obama_bp_oil_spill_horror</Username><Timestamp>1350853512116</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 17:05:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350853548894-56</Id><Title>It will be a close election, PERIOD</Title><Msg>Which begs the question, if Obama's so great why is it so close?

The already unpopular 2010 health care reform law has been converted by the court into a $1.76 trillion tax increase funded by escalating taxes to be paid the vast majority of taxpayers. The high court’s ruling leaves in place 20 tax increases in the health-care law, of those, 12 tax hikes would affect families earning less than $250,000 per year, including a “Cadillac tax” on high-cost insurance plans, a tax on insurance providers, and an excise tax on medical device manufacturers. By formally converting ‘Obamacare’ into ‘Obamatax,’ the court allows Obama to raise taxes on the middle-class. The decision is a distressing blow to taxpayers and represents the single largest tax increase on young people in the nation’s history. When it takes full effect, the Internal Revenue Service will have immense new power and authority to persecute and prosecute a whole new group of taxpayers. If the law takes full effect, it will devastate small businesses and destroy any chance for a sustainable economic recovery. It will add trillions of dollars to the national debt and push the country toward bankruptcy even faster than current projections. Any individual who believes that this decision must be overturned must do everything possible to undo the damage that has been done, especially at the ballot box on November 6.</Msg><Username>obama_tax_secrets</Username><Timestamp>1350853664117</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 17:07:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350853724800-63</Id><Topic><Title>ANOTHER ONE OF OBAMA'S KIND GOES SHOOTING AT PEOPLE AT WISC.

Bain didn't build that new factory -- the Chinese Government Did October 20, 2012 | Mitt romney has made Obama's out-of-context “you didn't build that” quote a central theme of his campaign. It's ironic, as Mitt Romney is going to profit just before the election when Bain-owned Sensata Technologies moves 170 high-tech jobs from Freeport, Illinois, to a plant in China built for the firm by the Chinese government. Sensata enjoyed record revenues last year – this isn't about making the “hard choices” necessary to save a failing enterprise. The workers in Freeport have been working 24 hours a day, in three shifts. They make $14-17 per hour, with benefits. According to a report by the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights, one of Bain's first actions after buying Sensata was to set up “12 Sensata/Bain capital funds 'organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands' so as to avoid paying taxes.” They'll get a small tax break for relocating the plant – the one Mitt Romney insisted did not exist during the first debate – and then use those offshore funds to defer taxes on some of the income the company generates. American tax-payers, on the other hand, have paid $780,000 to retrain some of Sensata's laid off workers in Illinois, according to the New York Times . One would be hard pressed to come up with a clearer example of capturing private gains while socializing the costs. Mitt Romney is not directly involved in Bain Capital, but he did build its business model. In 1998, when he was actively running Bain, he personally visited the Global-Tech Appliances plant in Dongguan, China. He witnessed, personally, the horrific conditions the plant's workers were toiling in for .24 cents an hour, and didn't hesitate to invest millions in the firm." -Alternet dot org. "Romney's Bain Capital Is Sending a Bunch of High-Tech Jobs to China on the Day Before the Election. The story of Sensata Technologies is about the hollowing out of America's economy by a rapacious 1 percent. October 16, 2012 | On the day before an election that's supposed to hinge on jobs, taxes and the middle class, Bain Capital, the company Mitt Romney founded, will close the doors of a factory in Freeport, Illinois, and ship 170 good, high-tech jobs to China. The employees of Sensata Technologies were forced to train their Chinese replacements, and the American flag that long flew over the factory was reportedly removed while the Chinese engineers were visiting the site. A group of workers have set up camp across from the factory -- calling it “Bainport” -- and some supporters have tried to block the trucks hauling equipment out of the plant. According to Dave Johnson , there have been several arrests. Sensata workers have asked to meet with Mitt Romney and hoped to enlist his help keeping their jobs in the United States, but he has refused, instead remaining on the campaign trail where he speaks often about “getting tough” with China. The most important part of the story is that Sensata Technologies is profitable operating in Illinois. Net income last year was $355 million, up 16 percent from 2010. The company reported total revenues of $1.8 billion in 2011, up almost 19 percent from the year before. According to a company financial statement , “both 2011 net revenue and adjusted net income represent record levels for the company.” So this has nothing to do with “making hard choices” in the process of turning around a failing business, which is how the Romney campaign describes Bain's corporate raiding. Bain's partners are looking for a modest boost in profits by locating the plant closer to the booming Asian automotive market (Sensata makes high-tech automotive parts). They'll get a small tax break for relocating the plant – the one Mitt Romney insisted did not exist during the first debate – and possibly defer taxes on some of the income the company generates. It takes both capital and labor to make a successful business like Sensata Technologies. In order to make a few more bucks, 170 of the people who helped make the company thrive will be cast aside like so much trash. The layoffs will surely have a ripple-effect in Freeport – a town of 25,000 with a declining population and a poverty rate well above the national average. The move is the epitome of corporate America's lack of patriotism – it's capital unmoored from any sense of responsibility for the people that make the profits or the communities where they live. The city passed a resolution Monday asking Romney to intervene. But the Sensata story has, so far, had little impact on the presidential race, mostly because Mitt Romney has no direct involvement in the operations of the company he established (despite continuing to make millions as a “passive retired partner”). But this is reading the story of Bain Capital too narrowly. Mitt Romney is directly responsible for its business model. As Tom Gaulrapp -- a lifelong resident of Freeport and 33-year employee of Sensata – told the Huffington Post's Amanda Terkel, “They're still using his business model. He's the one who taught them how to do this. These guys were put there by him. So you can say he doesn't run the day-to-day operations, but he's still at blame for the way they do business." Mitt Romney started the firm, and built it up on a strategy of buying firms with little money down, loading them with debt, raiding their pension funds and breaking their unions and then “harvesting them” – in his words – for a profit. Romney is the only person to ever serve as Bain's CEO – since his departure, the firm has been run by a managing committee. The story is bigger than Sensata, and bigger than Bain. The issue is the turn America's corporate culture has taken, and what the consequences of its model are for our economy and, indeed, our society. And it is Mitt Romney's embrace of that model – ravage capitalism that is loyal to no nation-state and blind to every human virtue but profit – that should be disqualifying. In the New York Times , Chrystia Freeland, author of “Plutocrats: The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else,” wrote about the historical tendency of elites to self-destruct by extracting wealth from the broader community to such a degree that the society becomes dysfunctional and mired by social problems. She recalls how the Venetians became the most prosperous society in the world during the 14th century by opening their economy to a broad swath of the population. Then, at the height of its golden age, “the upper class acted to lock in its privileges, putting a formal stop to social mobility with the publication of the Libro d’Oro, or Book of Gold, an official register of the nobility. If you weren’t on it, you couldn’t join the ruling oligarchy.” She then notes parallels to the United States, which featured one of the most egalitarian economies through much of the last century, but is now plagued by rising inequality and decreasing economic mobility. She writes: The 1 percent cannot evade its share of responsibility for the growing gulf in American society. Economic forces may be behind the rising inequality, but as Peter R. Orszag, President Obama’s former budget chief, told me, public policy has exacerbated rather than mitigated these trends. Even as the winner-take-all economy has enriched those at the very top, their tax burden has lightened. Tolerance for high executive compensation has increased, even as the legal powers of unions have been weakened and an intellectual case against them has been relentlessly advanced by plutocrat-financed think tanks. In the 1950s, the marginal income tax rate for those at the top of the distribution soared above 90 percent, a figure that today makes even Democrats flinch. Meanwhile, of the 400 richest taxpayers in 2009, 6 paid no federal income tax at all, and 27 paid 10 percent or less. None paid more than 35 percent... Educational attainment, which created the American middle class, is no longer rising. The super-elite lavishes unlimited resources on its children, while public schools are starved of funding. This is the new [Venice]. An elite education is increasingly available only to those already at the top. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama enrolled their daughters in an exclusive private school; I’ve done the same with mine. Much of this is the result of the 30-year assault on organized labor. It's worth noting that Sensata Technologies is a non-union shop, which is a big reason the firm can move profitable operations abroad without much resistance. Employment, in raw jobs numbers, should not be the defining issue of this election viewed in isolation. We also need to consider what kinds of jobs are being created. A recent study conducted by the National Employment Law Project (NELP) found that while only 21 percent of the jobs lost during the recession were low-paying (with median hourly wages from $7.69 to $13.83), a majority of those created during the recovery – 58 percent – have come with such low wages. These trends are not Mitt Romney's doing, but he is the walking, talking personification of what's been happening in the American economy. Mitt Romney was an innovator in offshoring. He and his family will make a few more dollars as a result of shipping those jobs to China, at the expense of the workers who “built that” in the first place. That's why the story of Sensata Technologies should have an impact in this race. -Endquote. -Alternet dot org</Msg><Username>sunnsailor</Username><Timestamp>1350862324111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 19:32:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350863821806-75</Id><Topic><Title>US Ambassadors Release Joint Statement CONDEMNING Romney!!!

The Obama Administration has been touting the supposed upturn in the economy by using the September national unemployment rate of 7.8%. Don’t tell that to the blue-collar workers of Ohio. According to the Ohio Department of Jobs and Family Services, the private sector of Ohio took a nosedive in September. Construction: -4,100 Manufacturing: -4,300 Transportation: -1,800 Hospitals: -4,600 Financial activities: -2,900 Automobile dealers: -300 The surest sign of a failing economy can be seen in the one business that is necessary for survival: grocery statistics. And the September statistics reflect how bad the economy was, and which direction it headed in September: Ohio’s grocery stores cut 1,600 jobs and Ohio’s restaurants lost 4,700 jobs. So why weren’t the state’s unemployment numbers worse? Because the two areas that gained significantly were government jobs and university jobs. But here’s the dirty little secret the Obama Administration doesn’t want you to know: of the 50,000 jobs that were added in those two sectors, (34,500 in government and 14,500 in universities) 44,000 were added by the state and local governments in education.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1350866277136</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 20:37:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350866291545-77</Id><Topic><Title>Insider</Title><Username>sunnsailor</Username><Timestamp>1350862324111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 19:32:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HEY, DEWSCH!

Our response was as follows. Who you vote for as president comes down to which candidate’s plans are credible and whether you believe the candidate will work in the best interest of all Americans. We have listened to both conventions and watched all of the debates and many of their press releases. Here are our conclusions. Obama has to a large degree fulfilled the promises that he made prior to for his first term. He ended the war in Iraq, eliminated Osama bin Laden, got a heath care bills passed that ensures that everyone can get insurance even if they have a pre-existing conditions, eliminated don’t ask don’t tell, navigated our country through the worst recession in our lifetime despite obstacles put up by the opposition party, and signed a financial reform bill designed to prevent similar financial meltdowns in the future. He policies also helped save the American automobile industry. Did he do everything that he promised? No. He was unable to reduce the deficit, close the prison camp at Guantanamo, increase taxes on those making more than $250,000 or make changes in our countries emigration policy. In many instances his efforts were blocked by Republican filibusters in the Senate. While Obama has not laid out a specific agenda for his 2nd term he has pledged not to sign any legislation that retains the Bush tax cuts for those making more than $250,000 per year. He supports spending policies that stimulate new industries, protects our environment, rebuilds our countries infrastructure and improves the education of our children. He believes that a strong middle class is essential to economic growth. Romney believes that by further reducing taxes on both individuals and corporations and by cutting regulations hundreds of thousands of new jobs will be created and that the economy will grow. However, he has not provided any details other than to talk about reforming the tax system and not raising taxes on anyone. His economic plan is just not believable. You can’t reduce taxes across the board by 20 %, increase defense spending and balance the budget all at the same time without making major cuts in programs that impact peoples lives and adding to our country’s unemployment. Additionally, he has shown no willingness to compromise on major issues. He has signed the Norquist “no new tax” pledge and promised during the primary that he would reject any deal that reduced spending but raised taxes. He is in favor of repealing the “Dodd Frank Act” that was enacted to regulate financial institution and provide financial protection for consumers and the “Affordable Care Act” that grantees insurance to everyone including those with pre-existing conditions. He is also in favor of cutting funding to Planned Parenthood and Public Television. On foreign policy Romney appears to be a Hawk in that his advisors served in the Bush administration. He wants to increase defense spending and take a strong position against our adversaries abroad. He believes that respect comes thru strength.</Msg><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1350872370156</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 22:19:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350872399875-117</Id><Topic><Title>Economics Tells You To Avoid Cisco.

Look out for themselves. Economics says that a market operates more efficiently when all participate and with government assistance. It thus produces the better outcome for all. After the last Repub Depression in 1928, it was government stimulus that revived the US economy. That's right, a works program and military spending. It's a proven recipe when private capital gets too scared to invest. Just ask yourself, where were the rich when the economy tanked? Hiding!!! These idiots couldn't think of a way to save the auto industry which is part of our country's manufacturing prowess. So yes the FED is devaluing cash. So what. The FED's duty is to prevent economic collapse so that the remaining rich do not OWN this country. Because again, economic says an economy works best when resources are used effeciently and allocated correctly for the masses. Therefore spending now will result in higher returns in the future. I feel bad for public that are scared to invest because we will get either inflation or a severe depression. Most can survive inflation but not a depression.</Msg><Username>superdupershortysporty</Username><Timestamp>1350873621558</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 22:40:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350874534148-122</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY WILL 'WIN' THE 3rd DEBATE...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1350871487358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-21 22:04:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry Surf but Walterbyrd is bringing back memories of what a loser he was.

"The White House's new health-care proposal promises the "largest middle class tax cut for health care in history," which is a creative way of describing a vast taxpayer-subsidized insurance entitlement. Naturally, the fine print goes on to describe one of the largest tax increases for health care in history, too. This new ObamaCare bargain would for the first time apply the 2.9% Medicare payroll tax to "interest, dividends, annuities, royalties and rents," so-called passive income that we are told includes capital gains, though the latter wasn't explicitly mentioned in the proposal. This antigrowth investment tax would apply to singles earning more than $200,000 and joint filers over $250,000 and comes on top of the Senate's 0.9-percentage-point increase in the payroll tax, which would bring the combined employee-employer share to 3.8%. The rate hike on investment income would presumably take effect at the same time the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts are due to expire next year, bringing the top rate to 22.9% as the current top capital gains rate would also rise to 20% from 15%. That's a 52% jump, and the last time investors were slammed with anything comparable was 1986 when the capital gains rate bounced to 28% from 20%—or a 40% increase—as part of the Reagan tax reform that reduced income tax rates. [obama] In part this is a sneaky way of waging the House's war on "the rich" by other means while appearing to compromise. Speaker Nancy Pelosi's 5.4-percentage-point "surcharge" on modified adjusted gross income above $1 million—which also includes capital gains—was supposedly too extreme for the Senate, but the White House is trying to smuggle in its 2.9-percentage-point cousin. Of course, $250,000 is a lot lower income threshold than $1 million, and the rate can always be inched up later once the tax is already in place. The House surcharge is certainly destructive but it is at least above-board. The White House levy muddies up both the tax code and Medicare financing. The Medicare payroll levy was designed as a social insurance program with some connection, however attenuated, between taxes paid and benefits received. When Medicare passed in 1965 it was modelled after Social Security and the tax was supposed to be equivalent to a "premium" for guaranteed health-care insurance for seniors; everyone "contributed" at the same rate. Until 1993, the payroll tax was assessed only on the first $135,000 of wages, until the Clinton Administration and the Democratic Congress lifted the Medicare cap entirely.
