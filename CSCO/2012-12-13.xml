But our new NBC/WSJ poll shows that the Republican Party has already gone off one cliff, per co-pollster Peter Hart (D) -- the image cliff. The GOP’s fav/unfav rating in the poll now stands at 30%/45% (minus-15), which is down from 36%/43% (minus-7) right before the election. That’s compared with the Democratic Party’s 44%/35% rating (plus-9). And other than self-described Republicans and conservatives, just two other groups have a net positive view of the GOP: folks who live in rural America (39%/33%) and folks who live in the South (39%/38%), that’s it. What’s more, asked to give a word or short phrase to describe the Republican Party, 65% offered a negative comment, including MORE THAN HALF of Republicans.

Trent Franks of Arizona today, discussing the ongoing fiscal bluff negotiations between President Obama and Speaker John Boehner: I think the Speaker is at a profound disadvantage in the negotiations as it is ... simply because he's got a recalcitrant Senate and a president that simply is out of touch with reality. Hm. And which reality is that? Maybe the reality on Planet Wingnut, where up is down, trickle-down succeeds, tax cuts create jobs, and the Rhythm Method works. And the public secretly supported Republicans in the last election. Over here in our own little Planet Earth, the public resoundingly approves of Obama's approach to the negotiations -- and even a majority of Republicans agree that Obama has a mandate to take away those huge tax breaks Bush handed the wealthy. The crushing reality here is that Boehner and Co. are negotiating with their #$%$ in their hands. Of course, the current majority of members of the House happen to reside on Planet Wingnut. So that's a problem.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355413817295</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:50:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355415109597-24</Id><Topic><Title>Tax cuts create jobs</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355413817295</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:50:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Silly cut and paste Donna, following idiots as always?

December 12th, 2012 5:55 pm Henry Decker Michele Bachmann stopped by Jan Markell’s extremist right-wing radio show this weekend to share her latest unhinged conspiracy theory: that President Barack Obama is attempting to impose Sharia law in the United States, and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wants to override the First Amendment through a U.N. treaty. Right Wing Watch has audio of the interview, which really must be heard to be believed. Bachmann began by warning that “President Obama, if you look at nearly every decision he has made about this issue, it is to lift up the Islamists and to take down Israel,” before claiming that Obama has enacted “Islamic speech codes” in the United States to shut down any and all criticism of the religion: Not just verbal speech, but written, a cartoon, a painting, whatever it is, if it is in any way construed as being against Islam that is where the confrontation comes from the Islamist world and they want to stop anyone in the world from saying anything negative about Islam. Which means there is only one free speech right and that would belong to the Islamists. Everyone else would lose their right of speech and expression. The reason why this is important is because this is the whole game, it is game over if we who are in the non-Islamist world lose the right to criticize what the Islamist does, because the Islamist tries to advocate Islamic Sharia law and so anything that we would say in the future, once you criminalized anti-Islamic speech, anything that we would say that would be critical in any way of anything Islam does would be considered criminalized. Of course, the United States’ commitment to Israel has never wavered under the Obama administration, and the decimation of al Qaeda over the past four years hardly squares with Bachmann’s assertion that the president’s every move is designed to “lift up the Islamists.” Putting those facts aside, however, how does Bachmann think that Obama could get away with such a blatant violation of the First Amendment? As with most right-wing conspiracies, the shocking answer lies in the United Nations. “Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, she helped to formulate and write and pass UN Resolution 16/18, which calls for the criminalization — anti-free speech measures,” Bachmann says. “She’s already signed this. While a UN resolution doesn’t bind United States law, how in the world could the president allow the Secretary of State to sign a resolution that indicates that we are willing to take away the free speech rights of the American people?” Ignoring the fact that the U.N .Resolution in question does not limit free speech at all, Bachmann went on to explain that U.N. Resolution 16/18 which Hillary Clinton signed, presumably with the affirmation of President Obama..that’s the first step in a big step for taking away from you and me and all of your listeners our right of free speech and expression, religious practice, freedom of assembly, freedom of the printing press but even more importantly, it will empower the Islamist to use that against us. This is not the first time that Bachmann has accused Clinton of being complicit in an “Islamist” plot; in July she spearheaded a campaign accusing Clinton’s deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin of conspiring with the Muslim Brotherhood. That attack was so far over the line that fellow Republican John McCain — who usually loves a good conspiracy — took to the Senate floor to denounce Bachmann’s “sinister accusations.” If Bachmann persists with this type of paranoid rambling, she may suffer consequences for it in the 2014 elections. Unlike most of her colleagues in the Republican Party’s crazy caucus, Bachmann faced a serious electoral challenge in 2012; she edged Democrat Jim Graves by less than 5,000 votes out of more than 350,000 cast. Graves has said that he’ll “keep an open mind” about a rematch, unless Bachmann “really changes her modus operandi and starts serving the people” — and that certainly doesn’t seem to be the case so far.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355416355036</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:32:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355416526327-28</Id><Topic><Title>Tax cuts create jobs</Title><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1355413817295</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:50:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>markets up 100% since Bush II save the banking system.

Masri was seized in Macedonia in December 2003 and handed over to a CIA "rendition team" at Skopje airport and secretly flown to Afghanistan. It is the first time the court has described CIA treatment meted out to terror suspects as torture. "The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights unanimously found that Mr el-Masri was subjected to forced disappearance, unlawful detention, extraordinary rendition outside any judicial process, and inhuman and degrading treatment," said James Goldston, executive director of the Open Society Justice Initiative. Jamil Dakwar, of the American Civil Liberties Union, described the ruling as "a huge victory for justice and the rule of law". "Masri's treatment at Skopje Airport at the hands of the CIA rendition team – being severely beaten, sodomised, shackled and hooded, and subjected to total sensory deprivation – had been carried out in the presence of state officials of [Macedonia] and within its jurisdiction," the court ruled. UN special rapporteur on human rights and counter-terrorism, Ben Emmerson, described the ruling as "a key milestone in the long struggle to secure accountability of public officials implicated in human rights violations committed by the Bush administration CIA in its policy of secret detention, rendition and torture".</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355417611364</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:53:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355417862851-33</Id><Topic><Title>Coming for you soon W, Dick and Rummy!!!</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355417611364</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:53:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since Obama has continued rendition ( the practice of sending terrorists to other countries for enhanced interrogation) maybe he can go on trial with them.</Msg><Username>hairyroid</Username><Timestamp>1355417862851</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 11:57:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355417939724-34</Id><Title>Buffett, Soros Join List of Billionaires Calling for Tax Hikes They Won’t Pay</Title><Msg>#$%$ bag buffett and Soros. liberals... taxes should go up on other people leave my billions alone.

Buffett is among America's super rich, and his fortune, at $46 billion, is second only to Microsoft founder Bill Gates'. Prior to his latest call for the upward revision of the estate tax, the Berkshire Hathaway Chairman has also recently called for income, capital gains and dividend taxes to go up too, explaining in a widely discussed op-ed in The New York Times ("A Minimum Tax For The Wealthy") that higher tax rates over the years have had no bearing on investors like him. As much as this may sound like selfless advice from a renowned financier who simply wants what's best for America, in reality he's immune from almost all of it. As I discuss with Aaron Brown, Risk Manager at AQR, in the attached video, Buffett's do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do proposals seem to fit the criteria needed to be a patriotic millionaire.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355419210699</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 12:20:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355419298233-45</Id><Topic><Title>Bonehead "I WILL NOT COMPROMISE"</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355418303564</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 12:05:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah.

No doubt this is robinhood politics. take the 2% everyone is jelouse of make the other 98% victims and you get 98% of the votes. liberals lop it up. liberals deserve what they are about to get as a result of these games.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355425129086</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:58:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355425386577-103</Id><Topic><Title>Pocket indicators?</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355424829147</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:53:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a fiscal cliff deal will crash the market. either way it sould fall basied on lack of reasoning in the white house when it comes to free markets.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355425386577</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 14:03:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355425443144-104</Id><Topic><Title>before the election:</Title><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1355423931664</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:38:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>junior, you are a simple little pecker-wood, you have never had to control or earn any money, huh?</Msg><Username>captgail4444444</Username><Timestamp>1355425443144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 14:04:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355425490029-105</Id><Title>tax spend tax spend</Title><Msg>good luck america.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355425490029</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 14:04:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355425872614-106</Id><Title>socialism</Title><Msg>A federal judge in Hartford has ordered a Connecticut nursing home chain to reinstate nearly 600 workers who have been on strike since July 3, and to rescind the pension and health care cuts it had imposed.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1355425872614</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 14:11:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355425886302-107</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S UNWILLINGNESS TO NEGOTIATE ON TAX INCREASES</Title><Username>jaysallstarss</Username><Timestamp>1355422541882</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:15:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All my little donkeys coming back on line now.

So when you combine the Bush tax cuts expiring, the sequester in place, the commitment of both myself and my opponent — at least Governor Romney claims that he wants to reduce the deficit — but we’re going to be in a position where I believe in the first six months we are going to solve that big piece of business.

She turned the heads of top administrators when she created a fund that withheld alumni donations until the university either stopped their investments in companies doing business in South Africa, or the country ended apartheid. Interest in Diplomacy After she received her bachelor's degree in history in 1986, she went on to attend University of Oxford in Oxfordshire, England. Here she earned her M.Phil and D.Phil in international relations, and wrote a dissertation that examined Rhodesia's transition from white rule. Her paper won the Royal Commonwealth Society's Walter Frewen Lord Prize for outstanding research in the field of Commonwealth History, as well as the Chatham House-British International Studies Association Prize for the most distinguished doctoral dissertation in the United Kingdom in the field of International Relations.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355440668411</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 18:17:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355440820583-186</Id><Topic><Title>GOP succeeds in blocking Susan Rice nomination</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355439968282</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 18:06:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>of this #$%$ for SCOTUS Miers attended Southern Methodist University, where she received a bachelor's degree in mathematics (1967) and a Juris Doctor degree (1970). However, Miers' education would later prove troublesome during her nomination process. Her academic background went against a tradition that had gained momentum since the late 1970s of appointing justices who had received their collegiate, legal, and other graduate education at elite institutions. At the time of her nomination, all sitting justices hailed from leading law schools (specifically: Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, and Northwestern). Consequently, as the nomination process developed, individuals across the partisan spectrum came to both denigrate Miers on account of her degrees as well as to paint them as a non-issue. For instance, conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer addressing her education contended that "the Supreme Court is an elite institution. It is not one of the 'popular' branches of government," while conversely then Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) stated he did not feel an Ivy League pedigree was a necessary criterion for placement on the court. However, in the long run, discussion over Miers’ academic credentials was overshadowed by the focus placed on her career history and ties to the Bush administration, with fears of “snobbery” calls quieting discussion.[8] [edit]Professional experience Miers had clerked for the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, but had never served as a judge. She had neither taught nor written to any substantial extent on law. In private practice, as a corporate litigator, Miers had courtroom experience, but a scant and undistinguished track record of litigating in federal court (almost none litigating constitutional issues), and had never argued a case before the Supreme Court.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355440820583</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 18:20:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355440821519-187</Id><Topic><Title>carey was a wave during WW2</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1355440256044</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 18:10:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is l'il cumstain a woman?

It basically means a person is accusing another party of doing the very things which he/she is doing. From Wikipedia: Psychological projection or projection bias is a psychological defense mechanism where a person subconsciously denies his or her own attributes, thoughts, and emotions, which are then ascribed to the outside world, usually to other people. Thus, projection involves imagining or projecting the belief that others originate those feelings.[1] Projection reduces anxiety by allowing the expression of the unwanted unconscious impulses or desires without letting the conscious mind recognize them. An example of this behavior might be blaming another for self failure. The mind may avoid the discomfort of consciously admitting personal faults by keeping those feelings unconscious, and by redirecting libidinal satisfaction by attaching, or "projecting," those same faults onto another person or object. The theory was developed by Sigmund Freud—in his letters to Wilhelm Fliess, '"Draft H" deals with projection as a mechanism of defense'[2]—and further refined by his daughter Anna Freud, why it is sometimes referred to as Freudian projection.</Msg><Username>bullbear308</Username><Timestamp>1355444745279</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 19:25:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355444868633-214</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$ called to the white house</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1355437370602</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 17:22:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumb called people teabillies in the post he was crying about name calling in.

In 2003, University of Oxford philosophy professor Nick Bostrom published a paper, "The Simulation Argument," which argued that, "we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation." Now, a team at Cornell University says it has come up with a viable method for testing whether we're all just a series of numbers in some ancient civilization's computer game.
