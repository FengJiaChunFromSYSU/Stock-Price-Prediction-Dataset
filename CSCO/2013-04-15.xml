Exxon pipeline breaks spilling 84,000 gallons of Canadian crude oil near Arkansas lake [UPDATED] Originally published: March 31, 2013 On Thursday, I wrote about the 30,000 gallons of Canadian oil that spilled in Minnesota following a train derailment and noted the differences in oil spills caused by train accidents versus oil pipelines. Unfortunately, we now have another example of the large scale disasters oil pipelines create. On Friday, the ExxonMobil Pegasus pipeline, which brings Canadian crude oil from Illinois to Texas, ruptured, leaking at least 80,000 gallons of oil into the Central Arkansas town of Mayflower. Arkansas' THV11 reports: It was a rough start to the Easter holiday weekend after an oil spill struck in Mayflower. Authorities said as many as 40 homes had to be evacuated Friday afternoon. Lisa Song at Inside Climate News reports on the size of the spill: The size of the spill remains unclear. Dodson said the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated the spill at 84,000 gallons. The EPA and the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management did not return calls for comment. According to a Saturday afternoon press release from Exxon, 189,000 gallons of oil and water have been recovered from the site so far, and it is prepared to clean up more than twice that amount. KARK posted some photos taken by residents in the affected neighborhood:</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1366034273625</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 09:57:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366035870758-13</Id><Topic><Title>Don't remember the rightwing crazies that post here mention</Title><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1366034273625</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 09:57:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nobody interested in your drivel today, chump ?

This event is further proof that bomb control laws don't work, when bombs are outlawed, only outlaws have bombs. It is a second amendment , constitutional right, for every American to be able to protect themselves. This incident is clear evidence that bomb control laws don't work, existing bomb control laws were unable to stop this bombing and won't be able to stop bombings in the future.

Booker Elementary School in Sarasota County, Florida, when White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card informed him that a second airplane had just hit the World Trade Center. Bush remained seated for roughly seven minutes and followed along as the children read the book. After spending about 20 minutes total with the children, Bush was scheduled to give a short press conference at about 9:30 a.m. At the conference inside the school, Bush made his first speech about the attacks and was later taken to a secure location by the Secret Service aboard Air Force One before returning to the White House later that evening.[2] Bush's critics, notably Michael Moore in his film Fahrenheit 9/11 - in which Moore erroneously named the book My Pet Goat - have argued that the fact that Bush continued reading the book after being notified that the attack was ongoing shows that he was indecisive.[1] A 9/11 Commission Staff Report entitled Improvising a Homeland Defense said: "The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening."[3] President Bush was later quoted as saying he wanted to see how the book ended.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366059952638</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:05:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366060045310-119</Id><Topic><Title>My Pet Goat</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366059952638</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:05:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>funny how Bush was holding the book upside down the whole time, LOL he was probably drunk</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366060045310</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:07:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366060534858-120</Id><Topic><Title>BOSTON BOMBS: The U.S. Not A Safe Place Under Obama Admin.</Title><Username>deeperharbor</Username><Timestamp>1366060254984</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:10:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah not safe like 9-11 under Bush, good call there Goober</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366060534858</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:15:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366061084374-121</Id><Topic><Title>remember on 9-11</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366059495864</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 16:58:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I liked the memo he didn't bother to read titled "Al Qaeda Intends to Fly Commercial Airliners into U.S. Buildings."

And I said, 'It must have been a horrible accident.' But I was whisked off there - I didn't have much time to think about it." [CNN, 12/4/01] He has repeated the story on other occasions. [White House, 1/5/02, CBS, 9/11/02] However, it has been noted that Bush doesn't have access to a television until 15 or so minutes later. [Washington Times, 10/7/02] A Boston Herald article later says, "Think about that. Bush's remark implies he saw the first plane hit the tower. But we all know that video of the first plane hitting did not surface until the next day. Could Bush have meant he saw the second plane hit - which many Americans witnessed? No, because he said that he was in the classroom when Card whispered in his ear that a second plane hit." The article points out that Bush had told the story more than once, and asks, " How could the commander-in-chief have seen the plane fly into the first building - as it happened?" [Boston Herald, 10/22/02] By 8:31 or 8:40, NORAD knew that Flight 11 was hijacked, and by 8:43, they knew Flight 175 was hijacked. Bush has just been briefed by his National Security Advisor on the situation. How he can only think, "There's one terrible pilot," based on an impossible television viewing? Flight 175 an instant before it hits the WTC south tower.

Even if they strike a US base with an atom bomb, I doubt the allies will strike back with nuclear weapons. Remember, the allies, really the USA, could wipe Pyongyang off the map whenever they like, but the consequences would include a humanitarian disaster and upsetting the Chinese, so that is very unlikely to happen even if the DPRK manages to set off an A-bomb. The most likely scenario for a nuclear exchange would be an attack on Seoul or some city in Japan. I would not be surprised if the South Koreans have a bomb up their sleeves, developed with American assistance years ago, but kept secret all this time.</Msg><Username>alexey_gupta</Username><Timestamp>1366063280135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 18:01:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366063468402-140</Id><Topic><Title>My Pet Goat</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366059952638</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:05:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Twelve years later,dumb is posting about" My Pet Goat".

But the first independent investigation of Bush's military record by a former Air National Guard pilot has revealed the following: Pilot George W. Bush did not simply "give up flying" with two years left to fly, as has been reported. Instead, Bush was suspended and grounded, very possibly as a direct or indirect result of substance abuse. The crucial evidence – a Flight Inquiry Board – that would reveal the true reasons for Bush's suspension, as well as the punishment that was recommended, is missing from the records released so far. If no such Board was convened, this raises further questions of extraordinary favoritism. Contrary to Bush's emphatic statements and several published reports, Bush never actually reported in person for the last two years of his service – in direct violation of two separate written orders. Moreover, the lack of punishment for this misconduct represents the crowning achievement of a military career distinguished only by favoritism. This in-depth investigation and analysis of Bush's apparent misconduct over the last two years of his six year obligation suggests that Bush did not fulfill all of his military obligations to the Texas Air National Guard and to his country, contrary to his repeated assertions. Moreover, Bush's misconduct could have resulted in significant disciplinary action by his Commanding Officer, ranging in severity from temporary or permanent grounding, a career-damaging letter of reprimand, to forced reenlistment in the US Army (including active duty in Vietnam), to a less-than honorable discharge.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366064885635</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 18:28:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366064923840-152</Id><Topic><Title>Bush that is one terrible pilot, LOL</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366062673894</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:51:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With two years left in his six-year obligation to the Texas Air National Guard, 1st Lt.

Competition for the few openings in the National Guard was intense, and there was a waiting list of 100,000 nationally at the time. Bush took the Air Force officer and pilot qualification tests on January 17, 1968. He scored 25%, the lowest possible passing grade on the pilot aptitude portion. On his application form, he listed his "background qualifications" as "none." But despite the waiting list, his low score and his lack of qualifications, Bush was given a highly-coveted spot and was sworn in on May 27 for a six-year commitment, taking a solemn oath to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution and the United States of America. Bush and his father have adamantly denied that he received preferential treatment, despite the fact that his father was then a U.S. Representative from Texas and his grandfather Prescott had been a prominent U.S. Senator from Connecticut. But the Speaker of the House in Texas at the time, Ben Barnes, admitted under oath last year that he had received a request from a longtime Bush family friend, Sidney Adger of Houston, to help Bush get into the Air National Guard. Barnes further testified that he contacted the head of the Texas Air National Guard, Brig. Gen. James Rose, to pass along Adger's request. When asked about this sworn testimony, Bush was evasive: "I have no idea and I don't believe so," he said. But according to the Boston Globe, Bush "vaulted to the top of a waiting list of 500." This preferential treatment in gaining entry to the Air National Guard set the pattern for Bush's treatment throughout his six-year obligation, including his rapid promotion to pilot and 1st Lieutenant, his sudden disappearance from the skies with two years left to fly, and his failure to report for a single day of duty in his final two years contrary to two specific orders.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366065051689</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 18:30:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366065388484-155</Id><Topic><Title>Why haven't Obama and Biden fled for safety</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1366061518427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:31:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of your stupidest posts,Dumb .The president listens when the Secret Service says he is in danger, That is what their job is.
