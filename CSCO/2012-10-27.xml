RCP average in 2008 missed the real result in many states by several points (2.1 in Ohio, 2.5 in Indiana, 3 in Pennsylvania, 3.5 in Colorado, 5 in Arizona e 6 in Nevada) so maybe it's just due to the margin of error but it's worrying anyway. Anyway if Romney loses Ohio he has to win Colorado, Iowa, Wisconsin and New Hampshire (if he wins Ohio only one of them would be enough). So I would like to focus on these five states. Absentee and Early Voting look great so far according to RNC Political Director Rick Wiley: "COLORADO Republicans are leading Democrats in absentee ballot requests and early votes by over 10,000 voters. Republicans are outperforming voter registration by 2.13 points. Republicans won the first day of early voting in Colorado. In 2008, Republicans lost early voting by nearly 4 points. Republicans have made 1.5 million volunteer voter contacts in Colorado since the RNC’s AB/EV turnout program began nationwide. IOWA At this point in 2008, Democrats led by almost 24 points in early voting. Today they lead by 8.3 points, a 65 percent collapse in Democrat support. Almost 5,000 fewer Democrats have voted early this year than had done so at this time in 2008. Democrats are underperforming their share of 2008 AB/EV votes cast by 0.41 percentage points, while the GOP is over-performing their share by 1.23 points. The result is a net swing of +1.65 percentage points for Republicans. Republicans have made nearly 1.1 million volunteer voter contacts in Iowa since the AB/EV turnout program began in the state. NEW HAMPSHIRE Republicans lead Democrats by over 5 points in absentee ballot requests in New Hampshire’s key towns. Republicans are outperforming our voter registration in absentee requests by 4 points. Republicans have made over 700,000 volunteer voter contacts in New Hampshire since the RNC’s AB/EV turnout program began nationwide. OHIO Republicans are outperforming our share of voter registration in absentee requests and early votes by 8.73 points. Democrats are underperforming their share of 2008 AB/EV votes cast by 7.60 percentage points, while the GOP is over-performing their share by 5.94 points. The result is a net swing of +13.54 percentage points for Republicans. Republicans have closed the gap on Democrats’ historic absentee and early vote advantage for 15 of the past 16 days. Republicans have made almost 3.7 million volunteer voter contacts in Ohio since the RNC’s AB/EV turnout program began nationwide. WISCONSIN AB/EV activity is down from 2008 the Democrat counties of La Crosse (-19.25%) and Rock (-6.41%) AB/EV activity is up the Republican counties of Outagamie (12.06%) and Washington (26.14%). On the first day of in-person absentee voting, the Republican bastion of Waukesha County out-voted Dane County, a liberal Democrat stronghold and home to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, despite visits to Madison by high-profile Democrat surrogates and celebrities. Republicans have made over 2 million volunteer voter contacts in Wisconsin since the RNC’s AB/EV turnout program began nationwide."</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351338033652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 07:40:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351338161557-7</Id><Topic><Title>4 DEAD AMERICANS IN BENGHAZI WHERE ALL WHITE</Title><Username>callmewhimpy</Username><Timestamp>1351299559416</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 20:59:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And on top of all that, Obama &amp; Co. lets student ISLAMIC DEVILS into this country to commit terror if possible.

Now we are all familiar with the “ground game” in the state, but few have paid enough attention to the demographics that have been aiding Governor Romney. Ohio has actually been trending in the GOP’s direction for years: Many residents of Democratic-vote-rich areas of northern Ohio have left the state due to decreasing jobs, while the GOP-leaning suburbs of Columbus and Cincinnati have been some of the fastest-growing areas in the Midwest. Let’s put the microscope to these data: In 2008, Barack Obama garnered less votes in Cleveland’s Cuyahoga County than did John Kerry in 2004. This is surprising, since Cuyahoga is the largest county in Ohio and has the largest African American population. But all of the Democratic counties in northern Ohio, like Cuyahoga, have been decreasing in population, skewing the state as a whole toward the GOP. The fast-growing suburban counties surrounding Columbus went for Senator John McCain 60–40 in 2008. However, those same counties went for President Bush 67–33 in 2004. The suburban counties around Cincinnati went for Senator McCain 63–37, but they gave President Bush nearly 70 percent of the vote in 2004. However, Romney-campaign officials suggest that the suburban numbers in Columbus and Cincinnati are back where they were in 2004. If this indeed is the case, it seems quite difficult for President Obama to win the state, since counties that favor him such as Cuyahoga (part of Cleveland), Lucas (Toledo), and Mahoning (Youngstown) have all seen population drops since 2008, while the suburban counties continue to grow rapidly. For example, census estimates suggest that Cuyahoga County may have lost nearly 5 percent of its population since 2008, with many of the residents moving to southern and western states. On the flip side, the suburban GOP-stronghold counties that surround Columbus and Cincinnati have gained residents, some by nearly the same amount that Cuyahoga County lost. The demographic data are not only relevant to Ohio, but also to other Midwestern states, especially Michigan. From 2000–2010 Detroit lost over 250,000 residents and is now smaller than Columbus, which is why some believe even the Big Labor stronghold of Michigan may be within the reach of the Detroit-born Governor Romney. This doesn’t take into account eastern Ohio, a normally reliable Democrat area, but in the east, coal is is king. The Democrats may not win a single county in Ohio’s coal country because of the Obama administration’s attempts to strangle the coal industry. Anecdotal evidence for the Romney-Ryan ticket can been seen in the number of Romney-Ryan signs in rural Ohio, and most notably in the number of homemade signs. In addition, the size of rallies for the Romney-Ryan ticket has been nothing short of amazing. On Thursday night, More than 12,000 people showed up for a Romney-Ryan event in the GM-factory town of Defiance, Ohio (population 16,465), located in rural northwest Ohio. Polling has been questionable at best in the Buckeye State; the CBS/New York Times poll even gave President Obama a D+9 voter advantage in a state that had a R+1 advantage in the 2010 miderm election. Few pollsters have even thought to factor in the religious-liberty Issue in a state that has a large number of socially conservative, working-class Catholic voters in northern Ohio, in addition to a large swath of Catholic farmers in the western portion of the state. These voters often put social issues ahead of economic issues, and their faith is often more important to them than it is for voters on either coast. Such social issues, along with the demographic trends, point to a Romney-Ryan victory in Ohio come November 6.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351338618722</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 07:50:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351338660507-10</Id><Topic><Title>Gop up in Early swing state voting</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351338033652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 07:40:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bbuummpp</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351338660507</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 07:51:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351339820464-11</Id><Topic><Title>WHO IS MORE CHRISTIAN OBAMA, BUSH, OR ROMNEY...</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1351309391923</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 23:43:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LEAST OF ALL !

Host Greta Van Susteren asked Rice directly and repeatedly about a set of emails uncovered by Reuters. In what has been dubbed “Benghazi-Gate,” the conservative media has jumped on the emails as definitive proof that the Obama administration has been lying about what it knew and when in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attack on a diplomatic mission in Benghazi. Rice’s response was likely not what Van Susteren expected: RICE: But when things are unfolding very, very quickly, it’s not always easy to know what is really going on on the ground. And to my mind, the really important questions here are about how information was collected. Did the various agencies really coordinate and share intelligence in the way that we had hoped, with the reforms that were made after 9/11? So there’s a big picture to be examined here. But we don’t have all of the pieces, and I think it’s easy to try and jump to conclusions about what might have happened here. It’s probably better to let the relevant bodies do their work. Watch Rice’s full interview here: Throughout the interview, Rice highlighted the difficulty that comes in a “fog of war” situation, with multiple stories coming in which need to be processed and verified. Her statements strongly align with the evolution of the Obama administration’s understanding of what happened in Benghazi. Rice also joined current Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in dismissing the big picture importance of the emails from the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, as a small portion of the overall communication between the mission and the State Department. With her reasoned response, Rice stands apart from other former Bush administration officials, including former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Both Rumsfeld and Bolton have repeatedly insisted that the Obama administration has performed a cover-up of the events in Benghazi.</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1351346419810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 10:00:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351347086567-17</Id><Topic><Title>Great info inside Cisco System</Title><Username>rubiegjaq694439</Username><Timestamp>1351342453318</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 08:54:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just read your article.

QStarNews predicts the turnout nationally will includes 34.8 percent Republicans, 35.2 percent Democrats, and 30.0 percent independents. QStarNews predicts turnout will rise by about four percent, or a total of about 130,955,000 voters including about 600,000 for third party candidates and the rest going to Romney and Obama. Methodology: For EACH state, all of the following information was considered: results from the last four elections averaged together, recent political trends in that state (such as Republicans winning control of both houses of the state legislature in 2010 in Maine and New Hampshire), recent trends in demographic makeup that affect the politics of the state (such as the growth of hispanics in Colorado causing the Democratic Party to become more competitive), and the degree to which one or both of the major campaigns are targetting that state, such as both campaigns making Ohio the most important state and campaigning there more than any other state, and any other relevant political factors and data such as public polls from a variety of pollling firms, as well as data from the QStarNews polls of the presidential race. From all of this information a percentage breakdown of each state is calculated between Romney and Obama. This projection is expected to be spot-on accurate for predicting the outcome in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and close to the actual popular vote. Perhaps some of the most surprising states to some will be the following: Colorado: 54-45 Romney -- a suprise for many still expecting Obama to carry Colorado Connecticut: 51-47 Obama -- closer than expected, and probably an indication that Linda McMahon wins the state's U.S. Senate seat Florida: 54-46 Romney Iowa: 54-46 Romney -- many don't expect this Maine: 49-49 Obama -- much closer than expected Michigan: 51-48 Romney -- the surprise of the night, Romney's home state ties are more key than Obama's claims to have "saved" the domestic auto industry Nevada: 52-47 Romney -- this will surprise many Minnesota: 51-47 Romney -- this will surprise many New Hampshire: 53-46 Romney New Jersey: 50-49 Obama -- much much closer than expected, the Romney campaign will re-allocate resources to New Jersey if they believe this number New Mexico: 53-46 Romney -- most don't expect Romney to win New Mexico Ohio: 54-46 Romney -- Late momentum and great ground game win the Buckeye state for Romney Oregon: 52-46 Romney -- major surprise Pennsylvania: 53-47 Romney -- big time upset Washington: 51-49 Obama -- closer than expected</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351354299266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:11:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351354533738-29</Id><Topic><Title>'MY PARTY IS FULL OF RACISTS'</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1351341928713</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 08:45:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then maybe he should been a General of some banana boat in Haiti ??? or it's Army in charge of all 6 troops.

Good luck to you I know a lot of young people who have fresh degrees but little experience and they don't even get replies to their cover letters. Its insane they have to pay off education loans and can't get a job. Meanwhile Obama spent 4 years campaigning, giving hundreds of speeches, fund raising for 4 years, playing Golf, partying, state diners, vacations. Obama joked about the lack of shovel ready jobs. He would not sign the Keystone pipeline, he cut off drilling in the Gulf and the rigs went to Brazil and the Middle East and Africa.

Soetoro/Obama claims in his book “Dreams from my father” that he stopped in Indonesia to visit his mother. But again, his mother was not in Indonesia, she was in Hawaii with Maya, divorcing Lolo Soetoro.

At the time Barry Soetoro was in Indonesia, all Indonesian students were required to carry government identity cards or Karty Tanda Pendudaks, as well as family card identification called a Kartu Keluarga. The Kartu Keluarga is a family card which bears the legal names and citizenship status of all family members. Soetoro/Obama was registered in a public school as an Indonesian citizen by the name of Barry Soetoro and his father was listed as Lolo Soetoro, M.A according to the Indonesian school records. Indonesia did not allow foreign students to attend their public schools in the late 1960’s or 1970’s, and any time a child was registered for a public school, the child’s name and citizenship status were verified through the Indonesian Government. See Constitution of Republic of Indonesia (Undang-Undang Dasar Republik Indonesia 1945), Chapter 13, Law No. 62 of 1958 (all citizens of Indonesia have a right to education). There was no way for Soetoro/Obama to have attended school in Jakarta, Indonesia legally unless he was an Indonesian citizen, as Indonesia was under tight rule and was a Police State. See Constitution of Republic of Indonesia (Undang-Undang Dasar Republik Indonesia 1945), Law No. 62 of 1958. These facts indicate that Obama/Soetoro is an Indonesian citizen, and therefore he is not eligible to be President of the United States. Under Indonesian law, when a male acknowledges a child as his son, it deems the son, in this case Soetoro/Obama, an Indonesian State citizen. See Constitution of Republic of Indonesia, Law No. 62 of 1958 concerning Immigration Affairs and Indonesian Civil Code (Kitab Undang-undang Hukum Perdata) (KUHPer) (Burgerlijk Wetboek voor Indonesie). Furthermore, under the Indonesian adoption law, once an Indonesian citizen adopts a child, the adoption severs the child’s relationship to the birth parents, and the adopted child is given the same status as a natural child and the child takes the name of his step-father, in this case, Soetoro. See Indonesian Constitution, Article 2. The Indonesian citizenship law was designed to prevent apatride (stateless) or bipatride (dual) citizenship. Indonesian regulations recognized neither apatride nor bipatride (stateless or dual) citizenship. Since Indonesia did not allow dual citizenship; neither did the United States (since the United States only permitted dual citizenship when ‘both’ countries agree); and since Obama/Soetoro was a “natural” citizen of Indonesia, the United States would not step in or interfere with the laws of Indonesia.

Even former U.S. President Bill Clinton openly declared his doubt on Obama’s birth and eligibility to run for president until it was reported that the life of his daughter Chelsea was threatened by someone associated with the Obama campaign. There have been several lawsuits challenging Obama’s eligibility, but so far, the courts have ruled in favor of the President. On behalf of over 200 residence of his county, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has had his Cold Case Posse investigate the birth certificate presented by the White House as being that of Obama. The investigation has discovered numerous pieces of evidence that indicate that the birth certificate and Selective Service Registration are both forgeries and constitute fraud. Unfortunately, Congress appears to be impotent and unwilling to do anything about what could be the greatest case of fraud in the history of the United States and possibly all of history. There has even been some question about whether or not Barack Hussein Obama was really born in Hawaii as he claims or in Kenya as they claim. And to be honest, as often as he has lied to the American people about everything else, how can anyone trust him about this, especially when he has worked so hard and spent so much to hide his records.</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1351366774961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 15:39:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351366820665-83</Id><Topic><Title>Obama pulls an All Nighter, finally he woke up from 4yrs sleep</Title><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1351365914927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 15:25:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GM is back in bankruptcy again OBL is dead the CIA didn't wait for Obama's order, or shall I say Valerie Jarretts order.

We need to fire them all and replace them with private security firms that hire decent non ghetto people that dont have rap sheets 100 pages long. From boston cbslocal news website: "BOSTON (CBS) – Terri Ivester was on her way to a family christening in Chicago when she ran into a snag at the security checkpoint at Logan Airport. Terri Ivester says, “The TSA agent holds my backpack up, and um, says there’s a water bottle in this backpack, I’m going to have to take that.” That’s when Ivester says the agent left the area with her bag. George Nacara, who is head of the TSA at Logan, tells the I-Team that passengers have the right to stay with their bags. Ivester says she continued through the security checkpoint and she never gave it another thought until she got dressed for the christening. “I’m ready to put on my jewelry and I can’t find it,” she says. She realized she was missing four pieces including a single strand of pearls and a double strand bracelet totaling $3,700. “It had gone through the scanner, I think they saw the jewels and took them,” says Ivester. The Transportation Security Administration recently revealed that 382 of its agents have been fired for theft in the past ten years. According to Nacara, six TSA agents have been fired from Logan out of the thousands hired. He says Logan’s high-tech security camera system closely monitors checkpoints and is often used to resolve cases of theft. But there is a catch. The tapes are only saved for 30 days and Ivester says she lost time initially filing her complaint with police. By the time she made her claim with TSA it was too late. The I-Team also analyzed thousands of reports of stolen items nationwide, laptops, watches, currency and jewelry. Since 2011 – more than $60,000 worth of claims were filed in Boston. TSA reimbursed less than $3,000. Not surprising to Nacara, who says closed circuit cameras often reveal items are stolen by other passengers. Still the Airline Passenger Rights Association warns travelers a series of recent TSA firings means there’s plenty of reason for concern. The TSA’s advice: While they are watching you with your cameras, you should keep a close eye on your belongings.

Someone keyed the word “Obama” into two cars and slashed seats in another outside a residence that had Mitt Romney campaign signs. CBS2 and KCAL9 reporter Rob Schmitt spoke to Ken Slown, owner of one of the keyed vehicles. Slown actually supports President Obama! He explained to Schmitt that he and his wife — both currently unemployed — are staying with her parents and it’s her parents who support Romney. “I don’t know if they were trying to get a point across, to vote for Obama,” said Slown, “but to do something like this is not going to get the point across.” He estimates the damage to both of his vehicles at about $3,400. In addition to both cars being keyed, his wife’s vehicle had her seats slashed, as well. Said Slown, “They pretty much cut the backs of all of the seats.” A neighbor, who also has a Romney/Ryan sign in their front yard, were also hit. “Obama” keyed in the hood and on the black gate of an SUV. A GPS unit was stolen from a Dodge Ram nearby. The truck, however, was not vandalized. A report was filed with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. Deputies say a clear palm print has been lifted from one of the vehicles.

Just for fun, I took it out for a test drive. I wanted to sense that new "feel." The salesman (a black guy wearing an Obama "change" lapel pin) sat in the p#$%$enger seat describing the truck and all its "wonderful" options. The seats were of particular interest. He explained that the seats directed warm air to your butt in the winter and directed cool air to your butt in the summer heat. Feeling like messing with him, I mentioned that this must be a Republican truck. Looking a bit angry, he asked why I thought it was a Republican truck. I explained that if it were an Obama truck, the seats would blow smoke up your #$%$ year-round.
