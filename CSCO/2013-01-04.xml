This is an interesting fact, particularly amid the Democrats' feverish push to ban many different rifles, ostensibly to keep us safe of course. However, it appears the zeal of Sens. like Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) is misdirected. For in looking at the FBI numbers from 2005 to 2011, the number of murders by hammers and clubs consistently exceeds the number of murders committed with a rifle. Think about it: In 2005, the number of murders committed with a rifle was 445, while the number of murders committed with hammers and clubs was 605. In 2006, the number of murders committed with a rifle was 438, while the number of murders committed with hammers and clubs was 618. And so the list goes, with the actual numbers changing somewhat from year to year, yet the fact that more people are killed with blunt objects each year remains constant. For example, in 2011, there was 323 murders committed with a rifle but 496 murders committed with hammers and clubs. While the FBI makes is clear that some of the "murder by rifle" numbers could be adjusted up slightly, when you take into account murders with non-categorized types of guns, it does not change the fact that their annual reports consistently show more lives are taken each year with these blunt objects than are taken with Feinstein's dreaded rifle. Another interesting fact: According to the FBI, nearly twice as many people are killed by hands and fists each year than are killed by murderers who use rifles.

Working for the American people is a great privilege – and I have you to thank for this opportunity. As a result of your hard work, we held the House majority and elected 34 new Republicans to Congress on November 6. Today these members-elect – which include small business owners, a dairy farmer, a former Air Force Pilot, and a doctor – joined me and my colleagues in vowing to support and defend the Constitution. We took the simple, time-honored oath of office knowing that for the forseeable future we will be the last and only line of defense against a President, and a Senate Democratic majority that spends too much, taxes too much and borrows too much when left unchecked. The challenges facing our country – and our Republican House majority – are big. But so are the opportunities. As I told my colleagues, the oath of office doesn’t call us to serve party, or to faction, but to the Constitution, and building a more perfect union. Or, as I like to say, ‘doing the right thing.’ This is our charge for 2013. To honor our oath, do the right thing, and make this year the year we finally address our $16 trillion debt. We know our government spends too much, and it’s time for both parties to take on our debt in a meaningful way with significant spending cuts and real tax reform that closes loopholes, lowers overall rates, and helps bring jobs home. And with your continued support, that’s exactly what House Republicans will work to get done. Thanks again for all that you've done for our team, and God Bless. Sincerely, John Boehner</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357310135546</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:35:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357310497206-51</Id><Topic><Title>The befuddled puppet</Title><Username>careyh5050</Username><Timestamp>1357241035550</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:23:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My Goodness!!!!!!Looks like I struck a nerve.

You're going the wrong way bozo. For the past two years, the U.S. has gained an average 153,000 jobs a month. Economists say the number should be twice that to keep up with population growth and support a healthy economy. The unemployment rate did fall the past year — from 8.5% in December 2011 — but some of that improvement has come from people leaving the labor force. Some of them retired and some went back to school. But when jobless workers stop looking for jobs, they're no longer counted as unemployed. Since the recession's official end, the number of Americans 16 and over who aren't in the labor force — meaning they're either employed or seeking employment — has grown by about 8 million.

The left-wing Internet giant provided Silicon Valley’s biggest campaign finance boost to Obama, with individual employee donations supporting the tax-hiking candidate by a ratio of more than 31-to-one. Google rank-and-file workers pitched in some $800,000 to Obama. Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt, Google cofounder Sergey Brin, Chief Legal Officer and Senior Vice President David Drummond, and Google vice president and chief Internet evangelist Vint Cerf are all vocal Obama supporters and top donors. In December, Google’s Netherlands subsidiary disclosed in a tax filing that it had shifted nearly $10 billion in revenues to a Bermuda shell company. That’s “almost double the total from three years before,” according to Bloomberg News. In response to criticism, Google defended the scheme as a legal response to government incentives. “It’s called capitalism,” Schmidt snarked defiantly. Wonder what all of Obama’s operatives and media lapdogs who bashed evil, selfish Republican offshore tax havens have to say about that? Cue crickets chirping.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357319272919</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:07:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357319300709-99</Id><Topic><Title>ROCK CENTER TELLING How JFackingKennedy Raped MEME Alford</Title><Username>donkeydouchebags</Username><Timestamp>1357270219085</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:30:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah, their mom (meme) is a good lay, but she's an expert on bjs by now.

But neither Zuckerberg nor his many Facebook execs are actually down with following through.

In addition, Zuckerberg and a half-dozen Facebook insiders are all skirting hefty estate and gift taxes on their family Facebook shares held in annuity trusts. According to the Wall Street Journal the legal maneuver is called a “grantor-retained annuity trust, or GRAT,” and the total Facebook tax avoidance sum adds up to at least $200 million.

Forbes magazine named this California gangsta rapper-turned-music industry mogul the highest-paid musician in the world in 2012. He raked in an estimated $100 million, mostly from sales of his Beats headphone company along with concert revenue. Dre’s music electronics company was co-founded with Jimmy Iovine, who also founded Dre’s parent record label, Interscope Records. Interscope was funded by “progressive” billionaire Ted Field, heir to the Marshall Field retail empire and one of the nation’s biggest Democratic Party donors. Dre boosted the careers of prominent Obama hip-hop cheerleaders Eminem and 50 Cent. But overseas, he’s rolling like a Romney supporter. The rap mogul is now using a County Cork, Ireland, tax haven to protect his global headphones empire subsidiaries and avoid high U.S. corporate tax rates. The Irish Examiner newspaper explained that the elaborate structuring “allows for money to be [channeled] between the separate companies in the form of royalty payments or [license] fees to artificially but legitimately reduce profits as a means of reducing tax liabilities.” To paraphrase Dre and his Obama-endorsing rap partner Snoop Dogg, it ain’t nuthin’ but an E thang: Elitism. Exemptions. Evasion.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357320663403</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:31:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357320852630-109</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats and liberals have policies helping the greatest number of Americans.</Title><Username>juniorsclassmate_5</Username><Timestamp>1357319972425</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:19:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SURE CHUCKLES</Msg><Username>robconcarne1</Username><Timestamp>1357320852630</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:34:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357320906529-110</Id><Topic><Title>fair share obama's friends</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357319272919</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:07:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MIDDLE CLASS GOT A TAX HIKE UNDER OBAMA.</Msg><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357320906529</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:35:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357320946577-111</Id><Topic><Title>MIDDLE CLASS TAX HIKE UNDER OBAMA!</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357317460319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 11:37:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SO THE OBAMIE THINGY LIED</Msg><Username>robconcarne1</Username><Timestamp>1357320946577</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:35:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357321022385-112</Id><Title>Memo to all Republican fruitcake posters:</Title><Msg>Romknee LOST,Obama kicked #$%$,GET OVER IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1357321022385</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:37:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357321234662-113</Id><Topic><Title>more liberal slime</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357320553883</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:29:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's just good business.

Janice Arnold-Jones, who was the 2012 Republican nominee for New Mexico's First Congressional District, turned over home surveillance video to the Albuquerque Police Department showing an older man slashing her tire with an ice pick on Dec. 20. Arnold Jones suspected the man in the video was Gary Smith. In April 2012, Arnold-Jones’s campaign sued Smith alleging he did not have enough petition signatures to get on the Republican Primary Election ballot. A judge agreed and the legal move paved the way for Arnold-Jones to run unopposed during the primary election. Arnold-Jones said she suspected Smith slashed her tires in revenge. Albuquerque police Detective Lorenzo Garcia said he was able to verify the man in the video was Smith. "I looked at Gary Smith's MVD photo and compared it with the video and it showed it did appear to be him," Garcia said. Arnold-Jones said the incident has caused her and her family to worry about their safety. "This is not politics,” Arnold-Jones said. “I know what it's like when there is political retribution. You lose your bills, you lose your office, you lose your parking space, that's none of this. This is an assault on my private property on our residence and I believe it's by someone who is not very stable." Albuquerque police arrested Smith at his home Friday evening. Only KOB Eyewitness News 4's cameras were present as Smith was placed under arrest. "Did you slash those tires?” KOB Reporter Chris Ramirez asked while Smith was in the back of a patrol car. “I don't even know what's going on,” Smith replied. “They haven't explained anything to me yet. I don't even know why they came to my house.” “Well according to the arrest warrant you are being arrested because you were slashing Janice Arnold-Jones' tires. Did you do it?” asked Ramirez. “No, not at all,” replied Smith. “What if we told you there was video of you doing that? Would you still say you're not the person?” asked Ramirez. “Sure," replied Smith. Police said they believe Smith may also be responsible for slashing the tires of other Republicans who participated in the lawsuit against Smith.</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1357323480717</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 13:18:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357323503141-130</Id><Topic><Title>Bloomburg trumpeting gun control saying 33 people die a day from lack of gun control.</Title><Username>deadpainting</Username><Timestamp>1357321564413</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:46:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A mental health program would never get funding.
