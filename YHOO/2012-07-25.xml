He is the one who is going to engineer a purchase. At 20 billion dollars, Yahoo is way too cheap. The reason why Dan Loeb is confident in hiring Mayer is because that it is obvious that Mayer will be functioning not at her full capacity and Dan Loeb doesn't need a CEO functions at full capacity, since Dan Loeb is working to acquire all Yahoo ... probably with other private equity guys... MSFT and Apple missed the boat. Yahoo is dirt cheap at this price and these morons are going to loose it to Dan Loeb and then having to buy Yahoo from him at a much higher price.. I think Dan Loeb and buddies will offer to buy Yahoo at around $22 to $24 dollars a share and after it turns around, feel it for $45 to $50 a share... or just keep it. It is surely a money maker... growth no growth... it makes great amount of money for a private equity company.</Msg><Username>teknorhino</Username><Timestamp>1343190208568</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 00:23:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343191790733-2</Id><Topic><Title>Poll: Why Did Dan Loeb Buy 2.5M More Shares of Yahoo?</Title><Username>trudeau256</Username><Timestamp>1343172072002</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 19:21:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>because Dan Loeb, like Eihorn, is hoping that people follow his trade into yahoo.

YHOO has huge Asian assets that at some point will be monetized. As that happens, you obviously want the share count as low as possible. YHOO in an all out rush to retire as many shares as possible (on the cheap) before the big pay days come in. Then imagine what could happen of the core biz turns around. You will have huge cash being thrown out across a vastly smaller scare count. Basic mathematics my friend. YHOO down on global macro concerns is a gift to retire more shares at lower prices.

I get so annoyed every time they make a change here, gets worse every time. Further, because they ram so many ads into a page from so many sources, page loads and delays become unbearable. It is torturous - they have so much great content here, and kill all the value making the site so awkward and painful to use. I have managed to work around most of the advertising/load issues though - just view the page source, pull out those servers where ads are coming from, add to your host file with IP 127.0.0.1 and things will speed up enormously. I think I found about 20 to 25 servers they come from. You'll see blank spaces around your pages where the ads would be, but who cares - I'm not buying anyhow. Nice thing about this - works with every other site as well - they all use the same advertising platforms. Love it when those ads with the videos get stopped in their tracks.

Now, Yahoo even censors messages containing links to articles that YAHOO links to and posts on Yahoo Business. Ultimately censorship will turn people away from portals such as Yahoo and will move them toward portals with a more open environment. Is it any wonder CNN and CNBC are dying? Is is because people are getting tired of the same old propagandist news media that lies, distorts and omits. It will be the same with Yahoo. As Yahoo continues to be just simply a tool of its advertisers and the government it will die a slow death ... and no CEO will fix it regardless of how much money she is undeservedly paid.</Msg><Username>hermes3m</Username><Timestamp>1343215528034</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 07:25:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343216007740-12</Id><Topic><Title>I cant deal with this new message board format.</Title><Username>rbg5r</Username><Timestamp>1343176757407</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 20:39:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can use it, but would not in any way call it an improvement.

If YHOO were to use their announced $5 billion buy back to retire shares at the current share price, you have 900 million shares outstanding. Let's say they get that done by 2014. I figure by then, their remaining 20% alibaba stake is worth $10 billion. Do the math, it is simply too compelling. They will still have YHOO Japan and I'm betting a growing core biz by then. This is a safe and easy play IMO.
