Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

It seems to me that this company must going to basics and Yahoo´s employees have the motivation and the capacity to bring the market new products, without the need of burning cash with new "doubt value adding" acquisitions. Tech speaking now, YHOO is trading in a lateral range well defined, but after last two weeks we could see that the company is in nice accumulation mode, with two big green candles on weekly graphs that inspire Long to hold tight their shares. YHOO is navigating now over it´s 200MM, so bulls are in the driver´s seat right now, and Momentum is building up with a near term crossing MM´s 20/50/200, that could lead YHOO to spike near term and break up its perpetual lateral pattern. I love this kind of tech. situations, that could lead YHOO to give back shareholders some of its lost luster Personally I´m Long this undervalued company.

" You reduce your share count by a third, and you increase your Earnings Per Share by 50%. Do you not understand that doing this would have a profound effect on the stock price?" As they say figures never lie, but liars sure can figure. That math works if and only if the shareholders have an expectation that revenue and earnings will grow and the P.E. ratio expands. Unfortunately for Yahoo doing that buyback could and most likely will result in a lower stock price than at the present because total revenue and earnings are shrinking, the expectation of a growth initiative will diminish since no one believes that Yahoo can generate internal growth, and the PE will contract. (This is especially true if the earnings from YahooJapan end and/or if the cash from MSFT ends because Yahoo brings search back in house - Oh the expenses that will add.) Yahoo is actually doing one of the most inefficient LIQUIDATIONS ever dreamed up. The share buyback allows some smart investors to get out of large positions in one swoop without driving the price lower. A Dividend would at least give all shareholders some of their dead cash back. Here is the thing, watch Mayer decide to enter a whole new business and use all of that cash to try and compete in the social market (or some other) now take a good look at Kodak. (Bankrupt Kodak) All of the Billions they have blown trying to enter the printer business and then (Depression setting in) office and home printing starts tumbling at double digit rates. This is Yahoo's future. As I said Yahoo is doing an inefficient liquidation trying to keep as many executive and employees employed until they strike a miracle. Not going to happen.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1348240313555</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348240413761-41</Id><Title>Posts are being blocked about iaci</Title><Msg>my posts are being locked about iaci</Msg><Username>jpalopoli</Username><Timestamp>1348240413761</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:13:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348240465055-42</Id><Topic><Title>good control by Loeb !!!!</Title><Username>bjinvestllc</Username><Timestamp>1348239329058</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 10:55:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dan Loeb has bought a dead horse that even the glue factory won't take.

As for your proposal of an annual dividend (paid quarterly) that would put a floor under the stock. But consider this Yahoo earned 89 cents a share last year i think, let say 90 cents. The average dividend yield on the S&amp;P 500 over the last 10 years was 1.84% (google search) so lets say 2%. If Yahoo is trading at $16 where it almost is a 2% yield would be 32 cents. That means to have an average yield Yahoo would have to pay out 1/3 of its earnings each year. (Lets assume earning stop shrinking mainly because of interest on the billions in cash) Now Yahoo is going to lose its dividend from Yahoo Japan if it sells, but it will earn money on the billions in the bank account. How much? Not 2%! Lets leave the Alibaba Group IPO out of it for a second. What we now have is a company paying out 1/3 of its annual earnings to pay a 2% dividend and has only 2/3 of its earnings left for internal growth. What if Yahoo spends a few billion on acquisitions? Now the dividend is consuming more than 1/3 of Yahoo earnings. All that and with little chance of a dividend increase. So, I will give you that an annual dividend is a better option to keep the share price from sliding too far, but it is still a slow liquidation of the company. As for AOL, they are actually seeing some growth - not much - but that little growth along with their dividend and buyback and Armstrong's large personal cash investment in the company is putting success fantasies in the heads of investors. Plus, they also have the Pixie dust of a potential buyout dancing with sugar plums in their heads.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1348242739812</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:52:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348242889243-53</Id><Topic><Title>Frustration</Title><Username>joco52</Username><Timestamp>1348241321129</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:28:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But, but, but.....Did you forget?

You do know they only earn 89 cents a year right? Much of that is from the Yahoo Japan dividend - which they are selling. So you want about a 5% dividend yield on the present stock price when Yahoo will be investing its billions at less than 1%. Trust me the stock price won't rise to know that yield into the 1.5% to 2% range. Your 80 cent dividend just killed all of Yahoo's growth potential and even its ability to maintain its present weak status.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1348243667702</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:07:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348244190087-55</Id><Title>Yhoo Shareholders get screwed again. while employees get free phones and tickets to the Iheart radio show</Title><Msg>Yhoo keeps giving stuff away spending shareholders money and what do the shareholders get?</Msg><Username>jpalopoli</Username><Timestamp>1348244190087</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:16:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348244858740-56</Id><Title>Basket: ie Could Yahoo be bought out?</Title><Msg>The best thing for Yahoo shareholders would be a large one time cash dividend followed by a quick sale of the core. The problem is that I don't think the Yahoo core can be sold in one piece. No one has successfully turned around a web portal type business and not for a lack of trying. Even Ballmer is getting tired of his web initiatives it seems. I really believe Yahoo would have to be sold in pieces. Sports, Finance....a couple of subsidiaries maybe a few buck for the patents..... But then you're left with the dregs. This part will just have to be closed down, written off, and liquidated. An expensive and years long project. The best option may be simply to take all of the cash and turn Yahoo into an investment fund while continuing to liquidate the rest of the operating portions of the business. Of course, that would be the exact opposite what Yahoo is doing. So watch for a moon shot type project that will cost a fortune. It will either be a home run or a strike out. Bottom of the ninth, no one one base, no balls and two strikes and I see a swing and a miss.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1348244858740</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:27:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348244893650-57</Id><Topic><Title>Buy or sell Yahoo at $15.79</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1348185202571</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 19:53:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Buy!</Msg><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1348244893650</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:28:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348244987621-58</Id><Topic><Title>Basket: ie Could Yahoo be bought out?</Title><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1348244858740</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:27:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you want an accurate answer ask coldone or read his Yahoo Japan thread.</Msg><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1348244987621</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 12:29:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348245068113-59</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo!

That is pretty close to correct. Although I do see value in Techcrunch. As for the rest of AOL, I think if I stopped using MapQuest there would be no one using MapQuest. HuffPo might be worth a few bucks to NewsWeek Daily Beast. I will miss my Netscape E-mail address when AOL goes toes up, but I will hold out hope that Andreessen will purchase the name for old times sake. Now I must run.

Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.
