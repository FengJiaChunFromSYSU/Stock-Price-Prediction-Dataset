Yes I agree a change of Fed policy could trigger a market correction. But this time around it is really very different because the uptrend movements is really very gradual while reaching record level in the s/p particularly so the market is absorbing this record level in gradual manner likewise. So I do not foresee market correction in the short-term unless until we experience an upside movements aggressively. If we have a market correction, I think YHOO can withhold his ground.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1369282472510</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 00:14:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369284083048-2</Id><Topic><Title>If analysts were as smart as they think they are they would be running Yahoo.</Title><Username>stockplugged</Username><Timestamp>1369278001868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 23:00:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the variables pointing YHOO uptrend movement intact. I agree YHOO will be in the $30’s this year. An upgrade PT of $30 seems to be the norm PT mostly given by noted specialty analysts. Likewise none of these well-known analysts disagree with YHOO acquiring Tumblr, meaning a good deal for YHOO. Another important variable that is forthcoming is the Alibaba IPO. I think this is really huge to YHOO. In my opinion the IPO valuation would tell us how much we have to tack in to YHOO share.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1369284083048</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 00:41:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369301467102-3</Id><Topic><Title>It is a joke, that Tumbrl has the 27-fold price and Yelp the 50-fold market-cap of Local Corp, but both less US-Monthly-Unique-Visitors (newest numbers from Siteanalytics)</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1369056760083</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 09:32:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We also fundamentally believe that our pattern portfolio is undervalued so we think the value of our IP will be realized as we make progress and protecting our life under our patterns.

There are no sides, only what is going up in price on accumulation and going down in price on distribution. The investors hove no idea of where the stocks stand in this range. Believe this, I am not going to just give away the program as to how I see accumulation or distribution. But I do not mind adding a little color to the Market-place. Now think about what might happen should some 40 Million investors had the same view into where a stock stands inside this color range of the Market-place. Anyway Yahoo can spend some one billion for a blogsite, they could have color for about 10 million. Color does make a difference.

(NASDAQ: YHOO) is in talks to buy out Hulu. I estimated that acquiring Hulu would cost in excess of $2 billion. Marissa Mayer's strategy in movie streaming by buying out Hulu is stronger than Amazon, because Hulu already has a large content library (not as big as Amazon or Netflix), but at least it has one. It also has a user base of approximately 4 million subscribers, giving Yahoo! an effective base to grow from, and if Yahoo! was to expand Hulu’s services in key international markets, it can actually carve out a niche for itself while co-existing with Netflix. Something Amazon may not be able to do because Amazon’s intent is to compete directly with Netflix, whereas Hulu focuses more on TV shows and a narrower target market. If Yahoo! buys out Hulu, it is unlikely that Yahoo! would risk changing Hulu’s brand name into Yahoo! Hulu, or pull a brand-extension stunt that could hurt the company’s performance. Imagine if every Procter &amp; Gamble product had the name Procter &amp; Gamble in it, would you honestly be able to distinguish the difference between Olay, Vicks, Tide, and Listerine if the brand name Procter &amp; Gamble was in each of these different products? Having separate brand names help consumers to differentiate products and services, which is why Hulu could be the best investment decision Yahoo! could make in light of its current financial position.</Msg><Username>lutts</Username><Timestamp>1369341277934</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 16:34:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369341559071-47</Id><Topic><Title>Wish it dipped to $25</Title><Username>bee_plus_001</Username><Timestamp>1369338174661</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 15:42:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>buy them now anyway.

I do recall Chernin's bid a months back was $500 million, but everyone seems interested once again - they are valued @ closer to 2.5 billion.

Besides the obvious things friends talk about we got around to what investments/stock picks we have. I brought up Yahoo and Tumbler. He remarked.....oh yes Tumblr - all my kids use it! As a matter of fact their entire H.S. uses it. When I heard this I was totally flabbergasted. I asked if his kids still us FB and he said "occasionally." Again I was shocked. When I inquired further he said that they don't think it's worth their time anymore. It's no longer a favorite with kids their age. Sooooo.....while this example is not a scientific finding, I have to go with gut feeling. I"m not worried about monetization yet. Let's give MM a chance to marinate this big bird. For those who say Yahoo made past mistakes with purchases I wholeheartedly agree. They made lots of foolish large buys in the past. However, it's apples and oranges folks. The past CEO's did NOT come from Google. They were not "trained" at Google. It has always been a patchwork team with bad genes from non-inspiring companies. I say we will soon see the Google DNA take Yahoo to higher heights. Give it a chance, these guys are not dumb dumbs like the past teams. Also, stop listening to the "experts" - notice that it's 50/50 of for and against the acquisition. That tells me they know nothing. I rather trust what the H.S. kids are doing NOW vs. what the adult "experts" think Yahoo should have done or did do. Again.......I could be 100% wrong......but what if..........? LOL Good luck to all longs!</Msg><Username>toddspencerusa</Username><Timestamp>1369366249638</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 23:30:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369366259062-75</Id><Title>$1 billion for 1% revenue producing company?
