December 2008 $12 Today $25.... Just with inflation from 1999.... the share price would have to be north of $81 today just to be at even money..... Do you people even look at those books.... Don't you realize.... one will never be able to stretch a gnat's butt over a 6 inch fence post.... even if that person shaves all the hair off that gnat's butt.... it ain't gonna happen.... More and more young people know that Ms Mayer was sitting on Wal*Mart's Board of Directors before being appointed CEO of the exclamation mark behind the word yahoo.... and they all know where Wal*Mart has their Global Procurement Office..... Pipe dreams are only made while the smoke is in the glass.... Real dreams are made once the smoke clears.... Ms Mayer was born in 1975.....the last year America had a trade surplus..... She has only witness trade deficits her whole life.... Sad.... really sad... America had only a mere $533 billion US Government Debt in 1975.... She spends a billion for porn this past month.... but the US Government Debt today is over $16.67 trillion.... If any of you think social media is gonna get US out of that mess.... you sir/madam are one sandwich short of a picnic and three sheets in the wind. If no one "clicks".... the damn smoke stays in the glass.... right along with that pipe dream..... You young people had better wake your butt up.... and soon...!!</Msg><Username>madmilker70</Username><Timestamp>1371962131783</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 00:35:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371969100667-2</Id><Topic><Title>Organic Traffic of Local Corp (46% of Total Traffic) and Total Traffic of Zillow are equal, but Zillow has with 1,850 million</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1370703987694</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 11:06:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lori Chavez comes from Local Corp Debunking 4 Local Advertising Myths 6/21/2013 - MediaPost by Lori Chavez Fact or fiction – local advertising is a waste of online marketing dollars? If you answered fact, you could be missing a potential $38 billion market opportunity. The challenge is how do brands take advantage of deploying the right tools to reach and engage local consumers. Not everyone gets it right. Of all the misconceptions brand marketers have about ad networks and local advertising, perhaps the most critical is that it can’t be done well. In reality, it’s been something of an after-thought. As a result, some brands don’t embrace the nuanced approach necessary to target those markets in a way that drives desired results. Today, it’s essential to debunk some of the long-standing myths that are holding local advertisers back from success in their local market.
