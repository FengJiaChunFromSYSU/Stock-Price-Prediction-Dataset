Still, Tumblr offers 100 million blogs, and 36 million unique visitors in the U.S., 117 million worldwide? That comes out to one person per blog, which is a strange metric. And the price tag is questionable: $1.1 billion?

Some flickr members uploaded pictures everyday. They had daily contacts with many of their hundreds of flickr friends. Some kept person photo journals for photo therapy. Now since the changes, flickr isn't accessable with some devices such as a computer with IE. flickr ads can't be seen. When the 'changed' flickr was working a few days ago, I noticed that flickr members' photostream index pages didn't have any room for ads. When viewing individual pictures, the picture is now so big that there is no room for an ad to the right of the picture. That is if your computer or device can handle the bandwidth needed to view the now huge web pages. Flickr used to have ads next to the photo, and you could right click to view the original picture.</Msg><Username>sugarisaddictive</Username><Timestamp>1369382864352</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 04:07:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369382969765-6</Id><Topic><Title>It is a joke, that Tumbrl has the 27-fold price and Yelp the 50-fold market-cap of Local Corp, but both less US-Monthly-Unique-Visitors (newest numbers from Siteanalytics)</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1369056760083</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 09:32:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ignore lies and nonsense of lutts: Company reports positive cash flow from operations Local Corporation Reports First Quarter 2013 Financial Results Company reports positive cash flow from operations one quarter earlier than forecasted Local Corporation – Thu, May 9, 2013 4:15 PM EDT Local Corporation (LOCM), a leading online local media company, today reported its financial results for the first quarter 2013. “As previously announced, we achieved positive cash flow from operations a quarter ahead of schedule, due to solid gross margin expansion in the first quarter.

They use Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. The big thing now are these very short video sites(few seconds to 36 seconds) in Vine and Keek. As for "trained by Google"...big whup as that is no guarantee of success. Ron Johnson was "trained at Apple" by Jobs himself and look what he did to JC Penneys. Elop was "trained at MSFT" and he hasn't did anything at Nokia in the past 2yrs. Now if you say "trained at GE" then you'd be onto something cause for DECADES they were a feeding ground for future CEO's of other Fortune 500 companies. The HS kids grow up like crazy in those 4yrs and move on completely when college rolls around and its night and day between when they get their 1st career job. Think of the boy bands of the late 90's...HUGE from 98-2002 and then the teenyboppers grew up. Look at clothing stores tailored to teens...Abercrombie, RU21, GAP, I'm drawing a blank on a few others but their earnings fluctuate like crazy getting that group to buy. Whether Marissa does everything PERFECTLY to pull this off...hope so but I'm still against it from a risk/reward standpoint.

Excerpted from Bloomberg: "The one bright spot was its 40 percent stake in China's largest e-commerce company, Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. In 2012, however, Yahoo agreed to sell back half its stock in a company that dominates a high-growth market in the world's fastest-growing region. The deal, which Yahoo's board approved unanimously, was worth $7 billion, of which Yahoo netted $3.65 billion after taxes and buybacks. This week, Yahoo used a chunk of that cash to buy Tumblr. " ***** Sure, except over 70% of Alibaba was owned by outsiders - there would be no discussion of AG going public without a good chunk of that going back to AG. Sure, except Yang snagged that stake for $1billion &amp; last year when the stock was languishing, everyone and their Uncle was screaming for Yahoo to monetize a significant portion of the AG stake.

Part of the reason why these upstarts succeeded is because the brains were 'big fish in little ponds,' and their talent was recognized, appreciated and rewarded. Now, as a part of the HUGE (and growing) YAHOO!, they may feel their voices aren't heard, and they are becoming just another number. Dissatisfied, unappreciated workers leave. Retaining these brainiacs will be a big challenge for MM and her managers.

What if?....what if that all these acquisitions start to take hold and contibute to the core. You will see this thing blast off I think. I've been buying since $15 and frankly I'm still accumulating.

The stock DIPPED to $8.96 for less than a week before it was right back to the $11-$12 range. They've also bought back 260,000,000 shares in that time which in actuality makes this $20/$21 back then. A double or so! As for Hulu, it'd be cool as I've recommended video(Netflix) for 4.5yrs now so a feather in my cap but its been rumored that Yahoo is going to buy it for 3/3.5yrs now. It's gotten a lot better in the last year alone, I've used it a few times. Amazon's Prime could be the one to catch Netflix IMO. MSFT too is launching a service on its XBOX One that will go after Netflix. Winner in all of this is the consumer...loser potentially the investor.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1369447205451</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 22:00:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369448397255-111</Id><Title>Hulu $700M revenue now -Wow!

Yahoo will not get outbid by anyone for anything they set their sites on at this stage. Ms. Marissa Mayer will not, cannot, and should not be stopped at this point.
