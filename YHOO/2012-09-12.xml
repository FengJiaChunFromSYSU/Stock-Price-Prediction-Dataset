Sources said the deal is set to be announced next Wednesday, in which the Chinese Internet giant will pay the Silicon Valley company $7.6 billion to buy back 20 percent of Alibaba. Yahoo still owns another 20 percent. Yahoo will get $7.1 billion in the transaction, as well as a $550 million payment related to the ending of licensing fees that Alibaba has paid annually to Yahoo. It’s a huge return from when Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang led a $1 billion investment in the then-fledgling Alibaba seven years ago, with a belief in its CEO and co-founder Jack Ma. But once-cordial relations between the companies became tense in the ensuing years, as Ma sought to lessen Yahoo’s 40 percent ownership. After many public kerfuffles, Yahoo finally agreed earlier this year to sell half its stake. It still holds 20 percent, which could eventually reap even larger returns once the fast-growing Alibaba goes public in several years. Yahoo is required to sell 10 percent at that IPO and must sell the rest after that. Still, Yahoo is getting a pile of money now. After taxes, that gives new CEO Marissa Mayer about $4.5 billion to use in some as yet undetermined way. But it will most likely be for a series of acquisitions to try to reinvigorate the long-troubled company. Yahoo’s board and later its CFO Tim Morse had promised to return the money to shareholders by way of a stock buyback. But, last month — in a move that quickly depressed Yahoo’s shares and angered major investors — the company filed a statement saying that Mayer was reevaluating that move and could keep the money for other strategic reasons. Given what a huge windfall it is getting, it will be interesting to see if the board of Yahoo — which is meeting next week, sources said — will choose to return a portion of the Alibaba money to shareholders. A recent similar move by AOL — using money it got from selling patents — was partially the reason for the recent run-up in its stock. That will be the question once Yahoo gets its cash in the kitty, which is no small feat. The complicated transaction spans the globe, given the size of the borrowing — $8 billion, which will value Alibaba at $43 billion — that the company is doing to regain some control from Yahoo. The deal includes debt, as well as the sale of both convertible preferred and common shares, and includes a wide range of players. That includes current investors, such as Silver Lake, DST Global and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, as well as many others. “This is a lot of money flying around the world to complete this,” said one person close to the situation. Speaking of more money, it’s still unclear where Yahoo is in its long and very drawn out negotiations with its other Asian partner, SoftBank, over selling its stake in Yahoo! Japan. Sources said the deal was proceeding well right before Mayer was hired, but that she slowed down the talks to reevaluate the prices being discussed. Since then, shares in Yahoo! Japan have appreciated strongly, while shares in Yahoo itself have lagged. It’s a good thing that Yahoo has both its Asian assets — the value of them now makes up most of the company’s valuation. Until, of course, Mayer figures out a way to turn the money Yahoo is getting into more gold. An Alibaba spokesman declined to comment and Yahoo’s PR spokeswoman never speaks as per usual.</Msg><Username>sfm211myutmost</Username><Timestamp>1347426486931</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 01:08:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347426630357-9</Id><Title>Exclusive: Mayer Set to Get Yahoo’s Alibaba Billions in One Week</Title><Msg>According to sources close to the situation, Yahoo will officially close the multi-billion-dollar sale of half its assets in China’s Alibaba Group in one week.

(actually, 96,000 jobs weren't added because the Dept Labor dropped over 300,000 people as actice participants in the labor pool because they ran out of benefits!!) But analysts at the Federal Reserve Board, economists and business leaders say Mr. Obama’s declining economy is not going to get significantly better this year, next year or the year after that, until there are dramatic changes in the nation’s fiscal policies.

Boehner and the Congressional Republicans are working overtime to retard recovery by destabilizing the business/investing environment and so dampening investment in the US. Their donors don't have to worry about getting a job. Republicans in Congress will make a living after their faithful service. For example Rep Sen Gramm, who wrote the legislation enabling unregulated derivatives and worked hard in the Senate for Wall Street on financial "reform" for years eventually went to work as a Washington lobbyist for the Utah subsidiary of UBS, the Swiss bank. He was a VP. Now he has a nice job with the Heritage Foundation AFAIK. Romney is running on a crony Capitalism and plutocracy platform. That is a formula for failure that has been a disaster in country after country in modern times. It fails because it is not Capitalism and Markets which we know succeeds. Wall Street and present US medical care overall are crony Capitalist bubbles bought in Pay-To-Play Washington. They are eating more than a quarter of US GDP and also retarding recovery. The Republican "trickle down" or "supply side", Romney's economics, is a hoax, a cover story for redistributing wealth upwards. Do we get jobs out of it? No - we get offshore accounts, offshore investment, and shocking consumption. Wall Street and the Republicans detached themselves from Main Street years ago. Main Street is the real US economy. That's where most innovation and net new job creation happens. The corporations more and more buy their global interests in Pay-To-Play Washington, not American ones.</Msg><Username>maguro_01</Username><Timestamp>1347438001489</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 04:20:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347438605207-21</Id><Topic><Title>WashingtonTimes says Obama has worst record since WWII</Title><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1347433959455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 03:12:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Republican majority House of Representatives have been passing budgets and job creating bills but the Democrat majority Senate has been blocking every single one of them.

Not sure if anyone remembers this but that's what Veritas did to Seagate some 10 years ago - gobbled up the whole company for $10B or so, kept Veritas shares, and then sold the core Seagate business for $2B! I know that the folks who run these companies are much smarter than the average joe, but still it does not make sense!

Also YHOO should not have to pay taxes on the $1 bil they invested or the value of Y-China that they put in the deal. It seems YHOO should end up with 20% AG, (worth $10 bil but perhaps up to $20 bil in IPO) $800 mil in AG preferred shares. $6.8 bil cash after the pref. shares (with say $6 bil taxable) plus the $550 royalty payment, for appox $4.5 bil cash, (after taxes). That plus the $2 bil they already have comes to $6.5 bil cash to go w/ the 20% retained AG (and the $800 mil in pref.) so maybe approx $17 bil worth of cash and AG paper. That is YHOO'sr present market cap so no value is given to the core or Y-Jap.

Buy, buy and buy some more.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1347477733970</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:22:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347478110835-68</Id><Title>Price estimate when $7b Cash arrives?</Title><Msg>What do you think the price will be when yhoo receives the cash in the bank? $17-$21?</Msg><Username>jpalopoli</Username><Timestamp>1347478110835</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:28:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347478246653-69</Id><Title>what comes first?</Title><Msg>The Money or the BABY!</Msg><Username>coperfit</Username><Timestamp>1347478246653</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:30:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347478403122-70</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo's strength has quieted the board bashers...Ha!</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1347291360488</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 11:36:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coldone's army of longs has defeated hotmodel's multiple aliases of bashers.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1347478403122</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:33:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347478529290-71</Id><Topic><Title>Price estimate when $7b Cash arrives?</Title><Username>jpalopoli</Username><Timestamp>1347478110835</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 15:28:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think that the market is uncertain the cash will arrive.

This will net the company $7–$4.5 billion after taxes. mb99 broke the story here first. Yahoo's stock price would surely benefit in the short term from a buyback or a fat dividend, but what Yahoo needs in the long term is to invest that money in a series of new products that can restore organic growth to the company's top line. We know that Yahoo's previous few CEOs would have liked to have pulled a similar move with the Alibaba proceeds, but perhaps none of them had Mayer's apparent willingness to tell board members and major shareholders to shove off. So, where will Mayer spend the $4.5+ billion?

TURNER-----DID THEY DO YOU THE WAY THEY DID ME....READ---VS. S.E.C. CASE ON RIGHT NOW</Title><Msg>JP Turner Burner? ------------------------------ FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 2012-186 Washington, D.C., Sept. 10, 2012 – The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three former brokers at an Atlanta-based brokerage firm for “churning” the accounts of customers with conservative investment objectives, causing severe investor losses while the brokers collected handsome fees. The SEC also charged the head supervisor at JP Turner &amp; Company, Michael Bresner, as well as the firm’s president William Mello and the firm itself for compliance failures. JP Turner and Mello agreed to settle the SEC’s charges, while an administrative proceeding will continue against the three brokers and the supervisor. Churning is a fraudulent practice in which brokers disregard the customer’s investment objectives and engage in excessive trading for the purpose of generating commissions and other revenue for themselves or their firms. The SEC’s Enforcement Division alleges that brokers Ralph Calabro, Jason Konner, and Dimitrios Koutsoubos engaged in churning while they worked at JP Turner. They collectively generated commissions, fees, and margin interest totaling approximately $845,000 while the defrauded customers suffered aggregate losses of approximately $2.7 million.
