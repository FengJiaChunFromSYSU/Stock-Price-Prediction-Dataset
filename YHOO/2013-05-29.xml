Remarkably, it appears Yahoo is using their brand and credibility to give legitimacy to online porn and is doing it with alacrity. I'm not sure that this is what Yahoo leadership wanted to communicate, but this is the message that is being conveyed. And it's doubtful that the fawning analyst community and media are going to ask any difficult questions. It is my understanding, that any child can fudge their age and sign up for an account and then obtain unfettered access to unfiltered porn. Is this correct? Can Yahoo ensure the public that no underage children are signing up for accounts and visiting Tumblr's porn and sex sites? How does this comport with Yahoo's written code of ethics in which they desire to protect children and communities? Where are Yahoo's founders? Are they ok with all this? The iconic brand that they built is in jeopardy of being tarnished if this issue is not addressed.</Msg><Username>j_r_mcdowell</Username><Timestamp>1369834515352</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 09:35:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369835092650-21</Id><Topic><Title>Is Yahoo the New Purveyor of Porn?</Title><Username>j_r_mcdowell</Username><Timestamp>1369747468774</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 09:24:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>J R, you can make a personal choice to not open a porn site.
