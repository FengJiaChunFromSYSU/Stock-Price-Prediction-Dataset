I own iMacs and PC's. Our family has an iPad and now the Surface Pro, but remember: never fall in love with a stock or marry it. Apple is having a lot of trouble now, but is loved. Google is beginning to experience disdain and souring. The "Don't Be Evil" smirk is wearing thin on people, especially techies..Microsoft, as a stock, has the most upside and they are doing a lot of smart things.The smartest thing Apple could do would be to buy Yahoo now before it gets too much further along. As an investor, I'd rather the biding war come later.</Msg><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1370500938892</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 02:42:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370514787167-2</Id><Title>Obama's NSA is collecting phone records of millions daily</Title><Msg>Remember the liberal press including yahoo complaining about government collecting phone records of suspected terrorists during the Bush administration?

The order, signed by Judge Roger Vinson of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in April, directs a Verizon Communications subsidiary, Verizon Business Network Services, to turn over “on an ongoing daily basis” to the National Security Agency all call logs “between the United States and abroad” or “wholly within the United States, including local telephone calls.”</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1370514787167</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 06:33:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370519756507-3</Id><Topic><Title>I truly miss the comments from Coldone and Remmy .</Title><Username>lyonsaudit</Username><Timestamp>1369266392014</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:46:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>don't worry. as soon as the price moves up to a new high, co1done will resurface to take credit..patience, young grasshopper.</Msg><Username>matthewbergey1770</Username><Timestamp>1370519756507</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 07:55:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370521753082-4</Id><Topic><Title>I truly miss the comments from Coldone and Remmy .</Title><Username>lyonsaudit</Username><Timestamp>1369266392014</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 19:46:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The all in at $28 gang is taking a 2 week forced vacation away from internet.

Credit Suisse Group AG's transaction history with Alibaba has increased the bank's chances of a key role in any issue, the people familiar with the matter said, adding that Morgan Stanley is also likely to land a top role. Alibaba has yet to shortlist or formally mandate any bank for the IPO, but bankers expect the listing to take place in Hong Kong by the end of this year or early 2014. The issue is expected to value Alibaba at $70-$100 billion, and could raise $15 billion.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1370527196141</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:59:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370527276070-10</Id><Topic><Title>The Coldone is Leaving for Vacation</Title><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1369147048570</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 10:37:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PROVE IT #$%$!!!!

Yahoo! also has $831 million in preferred shares of Alibaba Group equal to $0.75 per share for shareholders. The 35% ownership interest in Yahoo! Japan (YOJ) is worth about $7 per share, and finally, the cash per share is worth $4.87 to Yahoo! shareholders. The total value of the investments and cash is a little over $23.50 per share. At a current price of $25.75 per share, that means investors are paying just over $2.50 for shares of Yahoo!. Yahoo! should generate over $1.5 billion EBITDA in 2014 within its core business. At a multiple of 5x - 6x EBITDA, this is equal to around $6.50 - $8.00 in per share value.</Msg><Username>sublimalt</Username><Timestamp>1370537833716</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:57:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370537922837-35</Id><Topic><Title>You don’t want to miss out on IOGA</Title><Username>palmerthomas471</Username><Timestamp>1370534840874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:07:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice Info</Msg><Username>jonathanavila624</Username><Timestamp>1370537922837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:58:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370538022479-36</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo: Goldman, Cantor Up Targets to $30 on Alibaba Value</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1368570511619</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 18:28:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>July at the latest.</Msg><Username>stronghold812</Username><Timestamp>1370538022479</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 13:00:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370538445720-37</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Undervalued Based on the Sum of Parts Analysis</Title><Username>sublimalt</Username><Timestamp>1370537833716</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:57:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Although I'd like to believe that Yahoo is worth three times its current valuations, there is a reason why Yahoo has been dropping this week.</Msg><Username>rising_asset</Username><Timestamp>1370538445720</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 13:07:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370539451075-38</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Undervalued Based on the Sum of Parts Analysis</Title><Username>sublimalt</Username><Timestamp>1370537833716</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:57:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, Asian markets aren't doing well lately (which affects Yahoo's assets in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan) and the US tech market isn't doing well.</Msg><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1370539451075</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 13:24:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370540142316-39</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Undervalued Based on the Sum of Parts Analysis</Title><Username>sublimalt</Username><Timestamp>1370537833716</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 12:57:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo is worth $40!</Msg><Username>stronghold812</Username><Timestamp>1370540142316</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 13:35:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370540481532-40</Id><Title>YHOO isn't moving but MEG is climbing all day on merger news.

Especially after Microsoft offered a 60% premium back in 2008 (and Yahoo STILL said 'no thanks'). Google wouldn't make a run because the government still doesn't want them owning that much search share (they'd have to sell it off to Microsoft). Apple is a software company, not a content company so I don't think they'd be interested. Microsoft wouldn't do it now either because they are about ready to start the process of splitting their company in half. That leaves Yahoo going solo and running with their "mobile first" strategy.....which is why you seeing them buy up lots of mobile talent.</Msg><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1370546695118</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 15:24:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370546716554-48</Id><Title>Short Opportunity?</Title><Msg>Overpriced, overbought.

Yahoo has more UV's now than FaceBook...and Yahoo's UV's have money and stocks and are the people advertisers love.
