Other revenue ex-TAC =$244.2 M (10% YOY growth). . Total REV= $1,094M. Average Estimates=$1.08B. My estimate is 1.2% higher. If this is true, and the Display ads grows, then we will see $35, as this is the only item that is holding Yahoo back.

Saturday, July 13, 3:23 PM ET Mobile made up 26% of search traffic tracked by SEO firm RKG in Q2, up from 24% in Q1 and just 15% a year ago. Google (GOOG) and (Bing-powered) Yahoo (YHOO) each got 28% of their traffic from mobile, and Bing (MSFT) only 15%. Google got 31% of paid clicks from mobile (a sign Enhanced Campaigns are helping?) vs. 19% for Bing and Yahoo. Monetization still lags, but (as suggested by other reports) the gap is narrowing; mobile rose to 22% of ad spend, fueled by 165% and 261% Y/Y increases in tablet and smartphone spend. Moreover, tablet ad prices were roughly even with PC prices; smartphone prices remained 40% lower. One problem for Google: iOS made up 69% of mobile traffic, and Google has to give Apple a big cut on much of it.</Msg><Username>scrapman50</Username><Timestamp>1373744953538</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 15:49:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373745317795-28</Id><Topic><Title>You know, i was never involuntarily taken to the YHOO board, until punktress Melissa Mayer showed up.</Title><Username>dunedin_blue</Username><Timestamp>1373739104493</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:11:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$, starts with a t, then w, then an a, and ends with a t. get my drift?</Msg><Username>dunedin_blue</Username><Timestamp>1373745317795</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 15:55:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373745930332-29</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone's Advice To Buy From $11 to $23 Was Genius</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1370629977022</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 14:32:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hahaha!!!</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1373745930332</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 16:05:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373745978219-30</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone and his army of longs have beaten hotmodel and her troop of girl scouts into the ground</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1373572761341</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:59:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coldone has made many of us rich.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1373745978219</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 16:06:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373746032845-31</Id><Title>What is the market cap of this?

Here are my $.02 about Yahoo, my favorite stock for 2013. Remember, don't try this at home without the special crystal ball! Ok, it's working, I think. Here goes... 1) HULU - I'm glad the HULU project is now officially closed. Going into this will be like going into a "Mormon" marriage....lol. Multiple wives (companies) will control one kitchen. It does not work. I rather Yhoo make similar relationship with all the content vendors to create their own HULU. Yes, getting traction will be a challenge. However if Google can create Google Music (or whatever it's called) to compete with Pandora and Spotify, Yahoo can do the same for video content. As you know Apple is doing the same. 2) Earnings - we will BLOW out earnings...JMHO. The stock will probably drop a bit (sell on the news) but then again it can blast off. My mantra is.....straight to $40, then to $100....then GOOG numbers! Yes, again you have my permission to call me nuts, crazy or any other complimentary names. : But I would love to say I told ya so about 3 to 5 years from now.....LOL. Soooo....you're hearing it from this crazy balzy poster first. 3) Angry Woman Syndrome - don't mess with a woman with determination like MM. Don't forget, Google did not promote her, did not give her the upper Exec role, passed her for promotions. TRUST ME.....she is a woman who is determined to kick their BUTT !!!!!!! Yes, she will be cordial, friendly, work with all partners but she does have an agenda. I believe it's a small agenda like world domination.....ooooops, I mean Internet Domination.....LOL. Wow, these batteries on my Crystal Ball is working overtime. 4) MM is a shopaholic - She is making news practically every week. Whether it's great PR, Bad PR, OK PR.....it's still PR. By continuing to purchase companies she will continue to make headlines. Headlines is good. :</Msg><Username>toddspencerusa</Username><Timestamp>1373750468920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 17:21:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373758771129-34</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone and his army of longs have beaten hotmodel and her troop of girl scouts into the ground</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1373572761341</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 15:59:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LMAO I haven't lied PERIOD unlike you Goingbravo.

Then twice this spring making $1.50 or so. I posted my options trade TWICE now which is more than anyone else here. How ironic you brought up LYING? You told Basket that your shares are up almost triple digits and most are double digits. Are you forgetting you bought in Dec. 2007 at $27? You mentioned you had 11,000 shares, had to sell a few thousand for monster losses in 09'(you did mention) and how many times did you say you "bought" when it was in the 15-16's as you became a "trader" even though for years you said it was for your IRA. Now you're down to a laughable "few hundred shares"...so why do you have TENS OF THOUSANDS of posts here over the years???
