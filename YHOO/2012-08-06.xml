This would provide an immediate boost to MSFT, separating the company's loss making online division from the very profitable core businesses. It would provide an immediate boost to Yahoo's long-suffering shareholders, as a buyout price would have to be $21+. And, crucially, the new entity would be better placed than either the current MSFT or YHOO to compete with the likes of GOOG and FB going forward, as it would be a strengthened and major player in both search and display and able to attract the necessary talent to compete given the possibility of a future IPO.</Msg><Username>geneva02139</Username><Timestamp>1344257342684</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 08:49:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344258100769-10</Id><Topic><Title>Taking Yahoo private</Title><Username>geneva02139</Username><Timestamp>1344257342684</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 08:49:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This has been talked about alot here for many months and the principal has merit.

Bing is slowly taking search share and I believe that the whole Internet business for MSFT is defensive against Goog. Rather like the US Military's 2 front war strategy. Fight one to win, fight the second to hold the enemy in place so you can win the first one. Then fight the second one to win. If that is the case with MSFT then they don't want to give up control of the Internet business to save a few bucks, but they also have no intention of investing a whole lot more in the Business. So under this scenario MSFT is going to fight to win the war against Goog in the Microsoft Office and applications sector where they make a fortune and hold Goog from becoming even more dominant in the On-line sector. No need for MSFT to own Yahoo.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1344261755651</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 10:02:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344262705065-13</Id><Title>ceo biggest concern</Title><Msg>is what to name the baby.What a pack of idiots!!!</Msg><Username>bhark114</Username><Timestamp>1344262705065</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 10:18:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344262818109-14</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo shows strong support at $15</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1333654757000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-04-05 15:39:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo's new support is $15.60,.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1344262818109</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 10:20:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344262871320-15</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo shows strong support at $15</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1333654757000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-04-05 15:39:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo's support has moved up to $15.60.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1344262871320</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 10:21:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344262938710-16</Id><Title>Have these idiots ever once</Title><Msg>considered postpartum depression.
