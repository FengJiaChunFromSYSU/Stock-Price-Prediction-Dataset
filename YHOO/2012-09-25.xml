While the details of her internal memo (leaked by AllThingsD) did not reveal what she will announce, there is a good chance that it will involve one or more of the following things that could save Yahoo. 1. New Partnerships and an Entirely Revamped Search Engine Several months ago, Yahoo was rumored to be dumping Bing, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) growing search engine, for Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Nothing ever came of that rumor, so it seems unlikely that Yahoo will surprise the world by announcing that it will switch to Google tomorrow. Yahoo might, however, be inspired to drop Bing and other search engines altogether and do what it should have done all along: Develop a fresh engine from the ground up. In doing so, Yahoo would gain control of its company again. It would be able to dictate its search functionality and maximize its capability without having to rely on another party's technology. More importantly, it would give Yahoo the ability to sign massive, revenue-driving partnerships like the one that Google announced late last year. Google will pay Mozilla $300 million per year for three years to maintain its status as the default search engine in Firefox. By spending millions today, Google will make billions tomorrow. Yahoo could soon be in a position to do the same.</Msg><Username>d_vanrij</Username><Timestamp>1348578214026</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 09:03:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348579585269-13</Id><Title>Pre-Market Says All the HYPE is worth 9 Whopping Cents!!!</Title><Msg>Probably luck if it doesn't close Red.

It was also mentioned to him that there is new management at Yahoo US with a Google connection. But he played it pretty straight…. He also said they had expressed this interest to Yahoo before on a number of occasions. Of course, Schmidt was involved in the discussions between Yahoo! and Google in late 2008 after the Microsoft buyout fell apart and before Carol Bartz approached Steve Ballmer to do a deal. Google and Yahoo strongly wanted a deal done, but the government said no. When Yahoo did the search deal with Microsoft in 2009, Yahoo Japan declined to participate.

Several people who cover Yahoo have stated in very strong language that, although the search partnership with Microsoft has been a failure, there is no way that Yahoo could do an alternative deal with Google due to regulatory issues. I disagree with that view completely. A lot has changed since 2009. Yahoo!’s search share has dropped markedly. It also had to outsource all its back-end search technology (and talent, basically) to Microsoft. It simply isn’t the same situation now as it was then.

This all comes as new Yahoo CEO, and former Google executive, Marissa Mayer prepares to give her state of the union address about Yahoo and the strategic direction that she’ll take it. Expect to hear a lot about her plans for reinvigorating search at Yahoo. Yahoo could cancel the Microsoft deal as early as next year according to the 2009 agreement.

This is truely exciting for me as a I have never had the opportunity to converse with an alien. I am now truely convinced there is life on other planets. As to the term "intelligent life", well that remains a question. 2. Did you beam here via some teleportation device or a ship or vessel. 3.

After selling all the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, Yahoo could own up to $18B cash, almost equal to its current market capital. Yahoo core itself is also creating around $1.3B cash every year. Everything is good but why Yahoo is still trading so low? I think the lack of confidence and huge floating size are the two major problems. IMO, Yahoo should buyback shares directly from those institutions who are willing to sell instead of buying from the open market. This could reduce the cost of both party and reduce the floating size quickly. I noticed that a few major shareholder have been selling hard on Yahoo. Why can't Yahoo talk to these institutions directly? To third point, how long do you want to wait for the buyback? Why not make it faster? Now that Yahoo has over $6B cash, it could easily buyback up to 400M floating shares from the institutions who don't want to hold Yahoo any more, let them go. After 400M buyback, Yahoo float could drop to 800M, Keep doing this after receiving more cash from Alibaba and Yahoo Japan(another $12B cash). We could easily reduce the float to 200M.</Msg><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1348586849498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 11:27:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348587079106-72</Id><Topic><Title>Survey, what news could make Yahoo pop to $20?</Title><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1348586849498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 11:27:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo should tell the word: Hi everybody, who wants to sell now?

Uhmmm, a dividend is a steady guaranteed yield on a position you hold. The stock price will always fluctuate (up or down) normally with the market volatility. That concept you have is the same that many other people have. That concept is true for a company that pays out a "Special Dividend" which is usually a one time large divi pay out given for a special reason. In that case, "YES", the stock price drops that dollar amount, but in the case of a steady dividend then "NO". For example: Today YHOO trades at $16 bucks. Tomorrow it pays out the dividend which for this purpose we will say is $.08 per share. If you hold a position of 1000 shares, then you receive $80 dollars. The stock for the next trading days will be range bound trading wherever it will trade based on market conditions, earnings, news, or whatever.... Those $.08 cents are not going to affect anything among the billion shares outstanding and millions of shareholders of YHOO. The $80.00 are guaranteed in my pocket each quarter while the stock price will move up and down until I decide to sell.</Msg><Username>aadaytrader</Username><Timestamp>1348621951635</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 21:12:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348622220112-225</Id><Title>Florida/NY already has 31 documented cases of early voter fraud.</Title><Msg>The very thing libtards claim "never happens"</Msg><Username>xraythrives</Username><Timestamp>1348622220112</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 21:17:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348624027384-226</Id><Topic><Title>Florida/NY already has 31 documented cases of early voter fraud.</Title><Username>xraythrives</Username><Timestamp>1348622220112</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 21:17:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fraud? in favor of who?</Msg><Username>theextremebull</Username><Timestamp>1348624027384</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 21:47:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348624214779-227</Id><Topic><Title>Dividend</Title><Username>aadaytrader</Username><Timestamp>1348617638499</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 20:00:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More Clarification!! If the asset sold was not on the books, but at the $1 Million paid years ago and 1/2 of it was sold at a multiples magnitude type profit, then buying back shares should not affect a price that has not reflected the appreciated asset to date, but the per share price should go up with a reduced number of shares being outstanding. Please also note that it is planned that about $650 million(about equal to 1/2 of the original investment years ago) is being retained to operate with or purchase with so the original booked assets remain on the books, again supporting no drop in the share price, but yes an increase in share price due to the lesser number of shares outstanding. A special divedend straight to the shareholders should also not affect the price on the surface considering the investment profit has not been on the books until right now, but it is not as good for the company or long term shareholders looking for the have increased share prices over time for it takes away the use of the assets improved evaluation in improving the operations of the company.</Msg><Username>mmrb6872</Username><Timestamp>1348624214779</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 21:50:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348624781017-228</Id><Topic><Title>Fresh News Forecast Stocks Jumps MSO</Title><Username>patriciashaffer829</Username><Timestamp>1348586264346</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 11:17:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GREAT!!!!
