Rep. Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, disclosed this week that during a secret briefing to members of Congress, he was told that the contents of a phone call could be accessed "simply based on an analyst deciding that." If the NSA wants "to listen to the phone," an analyst's decision is suffici ent, without any other legal authorization required, Nadler said he learned. "I was rather startled," said Nadler, an attorney and congressman who serves on the House Judiciary committee. Not only does this disclosure shed more light on how the NSA's formidable eavesdropping apparatus works domestically, it also suggests the Justice Department has secretly interpreted federal surveillance law to permit thousands of low-ranking analysts to eavesdrop on phone calls. Because the same legal standards that apply to phone calls also apply to e-mail messages, text messages, and instant messages, Nadler's disclosure indicates the NSA analysts could also access the contents of Internet communications without going before a court and seeking approval. The disclosure appears to confirm some of the allegations made by Edward Snowden, a former NSA infrastructure analyst who leaked classified documents to the Guardian. Snowden said in a video interview that, while not all NSA analysts had this ability, he could from Hawaii "wiretap anyone from you or your accountant to a federal judge to even the president."</Msg><Username>gkcreamcheese</Username><Timestamp>1371396377230</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 11:26:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371399627594-6</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone Has to be on Cloud 9</Title><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1368042722041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:52:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are hotmodel and you are completely obsessed with coldone.

I long YHOO since $15 last year. Made some money. But I totally changed my sentiment to MM and what she's doing after she paid %1.1b for Tumblr. She thinks Yahoo is Google? Yahoo and Google are two different animals in many aspects. Google paid $1.65b **in stock** for Youtube, when GOOG was worth around 150b. That was around 1% of Google itself's market cap. That turns out to be a good investment after a few years. Yahoo has 3.1b cash as of today. MM thinks it's best to spent 1/4 to 1/3 of company's cash to buy a company that **can** turn out to be a good investment in a few, or more than a few, years, since this company has a youth user base? I am very skeptical about the deal itself, as well as the people who made the deal. I would from now on look at numbers year by year to decide if YHOO stock is a buy.
