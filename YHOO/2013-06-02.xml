Rakuten is very well known in Japan for its on-line shopping, travel, golf reservations, community and greeting cards sites. This will be the company’s largest acquisition to date. “We are extremely pleased that LinkShare has agreed to be acquired by Rakuten under the proposed terms,” said ICG chairman and CEO Walter Buckley. “Since we acquired a stake in LinkShare in 1998, we have strongly believed in LinkShare’s potential to be a market leader, the strength and vision of its management team and the value it delivers to merchants and affiliates, added Buckley. “We view this event as a great illustration of the ICG model, as it demonstrates the full cycle of owning, building and realizing the value of one of our Core partner companies.” AP provides a little background info on LinkShare: LinkShare runs a performance-based online advertising business called affiliate marketing service. LinkShare places client companies’ advertising on blogs and other Web sites managed by individuals, and the site creators can get compensation once the viewers of the sites buy advertised goods. Established in 1996, Linkshare posted a revenue of $32 million for the fiscal year ended June last year. Its clients include such companies as Dell Inc. The deal is still subject to customary closing conditions, but is expected to reach completion within about four to six weeks. ICG is expecting to get about $150 million out of the deal.

Serously</Title><Msg>Have a significant investment in YHOO - OK so with rumors floating around about a HULU bid, I had to evaluate it. Even the new Panasonic 60 vivid plasma can't make HULU's programming look good - that includes the so called premium version - the content just is so weak that no one in the household even bothers to see what new programing have been added. My teenage children went to HULU a few times - found nothing good and they don't go back - it's either NETFLIX or Apple (not not say Apple programming is so good either - but much better than HULU. A billion plus for this company is just plain studied - part of a bubble leading companies like YAHOO up into the stratosphere chasing an illusion. If HULU is purchased, I am out.</Msg><Username>skincancersurgery</Username><Timestamp>1370210574028</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 18:02:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370220529978-8</Id><Title>YAHOO IS GOING PRIVATE</Title><Msg>BY MSFT?</Msg><Username>sep122</Username><Timestamp>1370220529978</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 20:48:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370226386788-9</Id><Topic><Title>HULU - A Billion?

Considering it has $670M in revenue that isn't even cost twice revenue. It'd be like buying Tumblr for $20M instead of $1B, which obviously you don't have a problem with. Hulu, was rumored to want $4B, 2-3yrs ago, and was worth $2.5B, not too long ago. Granted it all comes down to content but that stuff has EXPLODED in price. Netflix's original deal with Showtime was something around $100-150M and suddenly was 10X that. The problem with Netflix is they have ZERO new stuff thus Coinstar's Redbox has been a goldmine. Amazon has both new movies to rent(not as cheaply as Redbox) and content but not a very good streaming service, free expedited shipping on Amazon stuff makes Prime worth its weight in gold. I just seen an ad that Verizon is getting in bed with Redbox for a streaming service at $8 per month and comes with 4 free Redbox rentals, if gets on par with Netflix, that is a huge perk. Hulu, I've tried a few times recently, and its leaps and bounds further along than even 6mos. ago. Then if Yahoo can make a distribution deal with say Lionsgate or MGM or whatever for the latest movies you'll siphon millions of people from the competitors IMO. I'm all for paying $1 per movie which costs a few cents to stream and watch previews that Yahoo sells. You'll stop Redbox as you too have the latest movies, stop Netflix which doesn't have the latest movies and outside of Arrested Development and House of Cards you can find the content elsewhere. The Comcasts and Directv's which are buying to shut it down I'm sure will be screwed as people cut the cords...so charge exorbitant prices to "rent" the content out to these entities.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1370226386788</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 22:26:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370228666103-10</Id><Topic><Title>YAHOO IS GOING PRIVATE</Title><Username>sep122</Username><Timestamp>1370220529978</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 20:48:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why did you say that?</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1370228666103</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 23:04:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370230788035-11</Id><Title>Yahoo targeted email ads coming</Title><Msg>Another revenue source is coming to yahoo soon!!!
