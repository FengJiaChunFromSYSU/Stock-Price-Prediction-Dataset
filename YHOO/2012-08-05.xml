How long do you think Yahoo's spam enabling employees would last at IBM before real management fired them and put in real anti-spam policies to protect their paying advertisers and users? I'm guessing these people would be gone and replaced within a week! Too bad that Yahoo's ethical standards are still in the sewer.</Msg><Username>pmaxx144</Username><Timestamp>1344175371708</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 10:02:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344175437508-3</Id><Topic><Title>JUST LEFT THE IBM MESSAGE BOARD</Title><Username>pmaxx144</Username><Timestamp>1344175371708</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 10:02:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry, can't get rid of this old ID.

Could that be because all of the long aliases on the board bought Yahoo based on emotion and even after all these years still don't know anything about what Yahoo is and what Yahoo does? mewag51 asked a fair question, so I expect to see some sound logical answers given to him. Start posting aliases. I am sure that fake mb99 can manufacture some sources to get things going.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1344184091557</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 12:28:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344187966493-6</Id><Topic><Title>Google Already Submitted A Term Sheet To Buy Yahoo's Ad Tech</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1341345924446</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-03 16:05:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mayer may have other plans.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1344187966493</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 13:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344188884093-7</Id><Title>Story about our new CEO in today's NY Post-</Title><Msg>It says nothing about nothing.
