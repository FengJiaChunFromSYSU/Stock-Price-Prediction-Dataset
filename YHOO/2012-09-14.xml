NO, I'm not shorting. Only a fool would right now. But from low 9s to 10.30s I have made a nice profit. The chart pattern is very near a typical completion for a cup &amp; handle. That does not mean we won't go higher. Not long ago I said look for 10.35 - 10.50..... We'll we are here. I like keeping my profits. I still have a chunk in Ford though. I also invested in FTK in the 11.60 area. For the same reasons. Cup &amp; Handle chart pattern along with volume change and moving averages lining up sweetly. Within three weeks FTK went from 11.40 to 12.98. FTK will head towards 14.70 to complete the cup &amp; handle and then I will sell off some to. Those profits will go back into F most likely. I would post more TA, unfortunately I get mocked for it (yet it really works, what do you think the computers use?? Emotions? News? Lol) and my posts disappear. I've posted some TA facts and only F info and my posts neither show up or just dissapear. I hope F investors are doing well. :) PS, nothing wrong with buying Ford at these numbers for a long investment. F will only go up with simple retraces.</Msg><Username>anotherenigma</Username><Timestamp>1347617263127</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 06:07:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347618353966-4</Id><Title>The Right are always the mean ones</Title><Msg>but if the big O loses the party of diversity will be burning down the cities.</Msg><Username>bhark114</Username><Timestamp>1347618353966</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 06:25:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347620758221-5</Id><Title>Do I have this correct ?</Title><Msg>Obama campaigns while Americans are dying in the mideast uprising ?

I expect Yahoo! to move up sharply next week with the payout of funds from Alibaba. I hope that they make constructive use of funds. IMO that includes buying back shares, and strategic acquisitions. What many have missed is that MM really is in touch with the new technology ideas that are emerging in the industry. She has done well with her own personal investments in startup companies and there is reason to believe she will make good decisions with pending investments. I would rather invest the proceeds in new companies than get a one time payment. That being said, I still wonder why take cash and pay a huge chunk in taxes if you are going to turn around and buy startup companies. Why not have the money routed through the new companies and defer the taxes to some point in the future when those assets are producing some solid capital returns?????</Msg><Username>firsttestcase</Username><Timestamp>1347640477667</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:34:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347640755089-30</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo at its high of the day as the bashers exit</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1347558092864</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 13:41:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The bashers are so clueless.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1347640755089</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:39:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347640877638-31</Id><Topic><Title>Time for anydowners2000 to retire her beat up aliases</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1347633277284</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 10:34:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>downers2000 left in shame, now it's time for all the other bashers that have been so wrong arguing against coldone to leave in shame.

Lets hope that they not only get the first round of money but that they make positive splash with a plan that excites investors!!!! I am not sure how long the market as a whole can keep moving up, but I think Yahoo has barely moved up compare to where they should be in coming weeks and months. Still, they need to show a plan of action for their cash (and I don't mean simply capitulating with a one time dividend payout...I am referring to meaning full acquisitions and share buy backs that will drive the price up and increase revenues for years to come!</Msg><Username>firsttestcase</Username><Timestamp>1347646155877</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 14:09:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347646940321-42</Id><Title>$15.80 + close today.</Title><Msg>That is my guess.

Most of those who bash Yahoo are Yahoo longs. They bash the BOD, CEO and Yahoo for not being and doing as they want. Longs who have been waiting months and years for the deal to end their misery. Shorts and day traders love Yahoo for constantly jumping up and dropping down. Pumping money into the pockets of those who are not married to the stock. Shorts and day traders constantly make money trading Yahoo, they don´t bash.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1347649191076</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 14:59:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347649312169-47</Id><Topic><Title>$15.80 + close today.</Title><Username>mb525789</Username><Timestamp>1347646940321</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 14:22:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It has room to close above $16 today. be a nice weekend eh?</Msg><Username>randywms55</Username><Timestamp>1347649312169</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 15:01:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347649675394-48</Id><Title>Tired of waiting for Internet explorer and yahoo to load?</Title><Msg>Are you sick and tired of Yahoo controlling your content, slowing down your pages and generally being s-l-o-o-o-o-o-w? What I did was to download Mozilla Firefox. It's 10 times faster than Yahoo and Internet Explorer and they don't continually mess around in your business. It features 'on the spot' spell check and many other emenities, all better than Yahoo and Internet explorer. AND, THEY DON'T INSIST THAT YOU SIGN UP FOR FACEBOOK, the people known for selling your content. Wise up and dump Yahoo and Internet explorer. You'll be glad you did.
