Those contracts are a HEDGE with maturities of 9-15mos. out and will fluctuate greatly in that time frame. Its no different then when Buffett sold billions in S&amp;P options and put it in the Berkshire 10-K, he was down hundreds of millions and now he's up over a billion. It's a paper profit!

Yesterday, it was announced (to the public) that LPS was stopping ALL salary increases just two weeks before they were due. At the exact same time they also announced that they will no longer contributing to their employee's 401k plan OR thier ESPP plan (which,BTW, they still have listed as a 'benifit' in thier company 'careers' section). This should be a wake-up call to all retail investors? I/we think LPS is aggressivly looking for a buyer.
