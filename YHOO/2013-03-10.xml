Kickstarter: National Debt ABOUT THIS PROJECT Hi you guys! Joe Biden and the rest of the gang here! :) We’re looking for some awesome people to help us Kickstart our dream project of having a functioning federal government! That’s where you come in: all we’re asking for is a little help. And twenty trillion dollars. As you may know, we (the United States government) are a little strapped for cash. Salvage a first-world government’s economy? In this economy?! As the kids say, “LOL!” (Laugh On Line!) We may be the ones responsible for “this economy” in the first place but still. Uncle Sam may have gotten us into this mess, but WE WANT YOU…to GET US OUT! There is little if any funding available for small-to-midsize debt-based projects such as this. Through Kickstarter, with your support, the country that you live in can remain a free sovereign nation instead of having to sell Ohio to China, cause then Ohio would probably start speaking Chinese, and that’s #$%$ UP. A LITTLE BACKGROUND: For those of you who don’t know, the USA is the best! Originally from England, the United States government has been a major world power since it was founded in 1776. The U.S. has brought you such great things such as sugar, mistresses, and obesity. Proud home to milk and Ashton Kutcher. Really into righteous wars! For those of you into civil rights: no slavery! For those of you into slavery: we used to have slavery! Imagine that famous picture on the cover of Sports Illustrated of Terri Schiavo holding an American flag. That’s our flag! On second thought, I think that was a painting I did in 2004 after doing grass for one of the first times. Still, she looks great in a tankini. As the kids say, “LOL!” (LOL A Lot!)</Msg><Username>bryanalban90</Username><Timestamp>1362931176057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 11:59:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362931237883-12</Id><Topic><Title>Joe Biden kickstarter the economy</Title><Username>bryanalban90</Username><Timestamp>1362931176057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 11:59:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>THE PROJECT: We’d like the United States to be fiscally autonomous. It’s been in the works for many years now, and we think it could be great. Thanks to Kickstarter, we have a chance to reach individuals who will personally bail us out of this mess. How great, for us! I know it’s a crazy dream, but hey – this is a country of dreamers. Dreamers, and Christians. HELP US, BACKERS, YOU’RE OUR ONLY HOPE!: Just a little Star Wards humor for ya! “LOL!”: Live A Little! Give A Lot (“GOL”)! PLEASE PLEDGE!: We’ve tried pretty much everything else at this point: war, selling some cars, literally making more money (you’d think that would work!!), blaming people, blaming gay “people,” war, and debt. None of that has touched the debt. Except debt, which has made the debt worse. Also, war! If we’re able to meet our Kickstarter goal, you will have literally been part of a miracle. A miracle in the great Judeo-Christian tradition of this fair country. Of dreamers! * BACK THIS PROJECT PLEDGE $10 OR MORE For your fairly useless donation to help the United States of America not founder under the multi-trillion dollar debt that we have amassed over decades of misspending and unnecessary wars that some may argue constitute war crimes, you get a tote. PLEDGE $20 OR MORE If you donate $20, we will list you as an associate producer of the Government by carving your name into the Vietnam War Memorial. You can tell all your friends you’re a ghost because you died in the Vietnam War! You know – the righteous one! PLEDGE $25 OR MORE I didn’t want to say this to the $20 people, but those guys are #$%$s. What kind of an #$%$ only donates $20 to a multitrillion dollar debt that is growing by 4 billion every day and has no sign of slowing? $25, now that’s the MONEY-money!

YHOO dropped its patent lawsuit against FB in July. YHOO and FB then announced a strategic partnership which the press release described this way: "Under the agreements, which include a patent portfolio cross-license, the parties will work together to bring consumers and advertisers premium media experiences promoted and distributed across both Yahoo! and Facebook." The changes in the FB newsfeed would seem to allow these premium media experiences to go live. This will bring more advertising $ to FB...and I think YHOO will somehow be a big beneficiary, either by selling some or all the rich ads that appear on FB, or distributing ads on the YHOO network that are bought on FB.</Msg><Username>argent_a_bend_gules</Username><Timestamp>1362935910888</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 13:18:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362937534768-18</Id><Topic><Title>Let's hope it's not true that Y will start buying overpriced companiies.
