It's just NBC now but same bunch. Mark Levin used to refer to them as "MSLSD" because of their awful reporting. Yahoo is an internet portal not a news company. Yahoo would do far better copying all of the headlines from DrudgeReport who had over 27 million hits in the last 24 hours. Yahoo has long paid a staff to review and post news friendly to Democrats and "attack" news against republicans. When Bush was president Yahoo would rant about the same irrelevant story against Bush for weeks staright. There had to be something negative about Bush on Yahoo homepage everyday as if it were some sort of a goal. Back then about a decade ago, Yahoo stooped as low as treason while providing aid and comfort to our enemies during time of war.</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1370336552936</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 05:02:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370337978172-7</Id><Topic><Title>GWBU &amp; BYOC Both Looking To Go Higher Soon &amp; YHOO Looking Much Better...</Title><Username>rogerdonna_1988</Username><Timestamp>1369075105847</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 14:38:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YES!

If they wanted a web site to work for both viewers and advertisers, there would be a display ad seamlessly sitting to the side in most web pages like how advertisers used to do in print newspapers that everyone read. The ad would not be annoying, it would not make viewers hate the media or advertiser. Unfortunately, many web sites are destroyed by annoyances. Such as pages that are extremely painfully slow to view if the computer or softwear doesn't crash. Many video ads are very annoying. The audio noise is also annoying. And the pop-up ads or spam or telemarketing clearly destroys the web site for viewer or members. It looks like such web design is intended to fail for viewers as well as advertisers. And in the long term it fails the who ever owns the web site because viewers simply go elsewhere and the advertisers will know that.</Msg><Username>sugarisaddictive</Username><Timestamp>1370378517685</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:41:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370379560933-36</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo PT Raised to $30 by Goldman Sachs Kept on Conviction Buy List</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1368535065528</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 08:37:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With MM not resting continue looking to improve YHOO bottom line and now bigtime investment analyst like GS raising PT to $30, recognition by Wall Street should be in the bag and just a matter of time.

On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -1.15% joined a group of banks that is lending $8 billion to Alibaba. The company could be worth between $50 billion and $100 billion and could hold an IPO as early as in the fourth quarter of this year, though the first half of 2014 is more likely, people familiar with the deal said. While Alibaba hasn't picked underwriters for its listing yet, it is widely believed among Hong Kong-based bankers that lending money to the company is a prerequisite for working on the IPO. Alibaba declined to comment. The company is expected to list late this year or in 2014. Goldman Sachs joined banks lending $8 billion to Ali Baba. . According to bankers who have had dealings with company, the IPO will likely be in Hong Kong, with a possible dual listing in the U.S. Alibaba, which owns Taobao, China's dominant retail e-commerce site, declined to comment on the potential deal"</Msg><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1370391297812</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 20:14:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370391496280-48</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Will Be Bought for Over $40 per Share After Alibaba IPO</Title><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1370378272614</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:37:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ha, yes, but the way I wrote it was incorrect.

I saw ONLY an upside for this stock. With huge growth potential, strengthening revenues, increasing user base. Then BAM, apple farts a little noise. Stock plummets 17% in three days and im $100,000 less richer. Im on your side, HUGE growth potential from here at these prices for say Late July early Sept? But the way I look at it, the Shorts are going to win this battle, this stock WILL hit $13 before it hits $16, so why by? With the Fed's news and everything else going on in the market, P is only headed down short term. So, Ive loaded up on PUTS, figured if I cant beat them...you get it. Once it hits $13, ill switch and hit the other direction. Just the other day I bought 20,000 calls for June with a $15 strike. Took a $35,000 beating on those alone and they were half of it... I also have some June $25 strikes that apparently are literally worthless today. Only thing im saying to you here...let the floor come out before getting those calls. Could get them while the stock is at $11, who know.
