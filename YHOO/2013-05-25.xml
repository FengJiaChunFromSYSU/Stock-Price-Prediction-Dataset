So, I signed on to see if this was obvious. Spent 30 minutes going through many of the blog categories, Art, Photograpy, etc, etc. Opened up many of them figuring perhaps there were nudy pic buried in them, never saw any. Also, saw no category labeled porn. Perhaps, I didn't look in the right places, but certainly this is not an obvious porn site. Perhaps, it's buried in a sub-category, gender oriented, but I'm not worried about it anymore.

Islam did not exist in the time of Abraham. The prophet Mohammed introduced Islam several hundred years after Jesus was on earth. Also, Christians believe that the God of the Old Testament loved mankind so much, that he sent His very own Son to die on the Cross to save men from the terrible fate that we so deserve. We believe that God is NOT a vengeful God, but a God of love who Loves ALL people. God loves Muslims greatly and desires that they come to know His Son as their Savior. Read the New Testament of the Bible and you will find this to be true. Read the Old Testament and you will see a patient God not willing to do harm, but always waiting for people to repent. It was only the lack of repentance and persistent sinfulness in the people of the Old Testament that led to God deliver punishment. That is NOT His desire.
