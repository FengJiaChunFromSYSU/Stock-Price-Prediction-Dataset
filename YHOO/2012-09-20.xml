Then came something very new to Yahoo. Mayer told the team she loves the new product so much that she wants it shipped by December 1 – months ahead of the schedule the team itself had put together. Mayer told the team they had one week to figure out if they could meet this deadline. If, at the end of that week, the team decided they would not be able to meet the December 1 deadline, Mayer said she would find a team that could.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1348114590837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 00:16:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348115684348-2</Id><Topic><Title>YAHOO is going to become an incubator + Wireless Asset Aggregator</Title><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1348099439028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 20:03:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In putting together a deal, risk arbitrage wise, the lowest risk is the current $18B which will come from syndicated partner/investors. $7 Bil premium is basically already sitting in the bank and Loeb's acct.</Msg><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1348115684348</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 00:34:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348116707375-3</Id><Topic><Title>What is Marissa Mayer's Top Secret Pet Project at Yahoo?</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1348114590837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 00:16:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That story has been floating for weeks.

If you monitor the major shareholders for the past two years like I did, you would know, other than third point - the new largest shareholder, most of the major shareholders have been selling hard on Yahoo for the past two years or maybe longer but I didn't monitor Yahoo for that long. I was wondering if the cost of their shares were very low since Yahoo had been splitting its shares in the past a few times but I couldn't find out how low their cost was. Maybe $5, $10? I don't know. These major shareholders are still holding more than 70% of Yahoo shares and I have noticed that no matter what good news came out, they have never stopped selling and it looks like they are going to sell all of their shares without hesitation. I want to find out why. Because they had lost confidence and patience on Yahoo and wasted too much time on Yahoo and they decided to move on? I don't know. What I know is, most of the major shareholders had been selling covered puts for many years to drop their cost and it was very efficient since Yahoo had never really go up for the past four years. Would they stop selling Yahoo shares after Alibaba sale? I don't know either. Maybe the problem for Yahoo is, no growth, no matter how many cash Yahoo gets, it's revenue is dropping and it would eventually spend these cash either on IPhones or stock buy back. Since the core business is not doing so well and is still going down, Yahoo stock would never go up for another three years unless if there is a buyout which is not likely coming after Alibaba sale. So maybe that's why they will keep selling until they don't have any(they still have 70% left). All these sold shares would go to Yahoo itself since no other institutions are buying other than third point and I don't think third point could have bought all of their shares. So if you can wait, wait for Yahoo to buy back shares in the next three years gradually with the cash it got from Alibaba while the large institutions are selling their 70% shares. Maybe Yahoo's share will remain between $12 - $18 for the next three or five years until it got bought out or die. I had lost two years and didn't earn anything on Yahoo so I had to decide now if I want to wait another three years for a potential 20% gain or move on now for a faster return.</Msg><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1348144729033</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 08:38:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348146264689-28</Id><Topic><Title>The reason Yahoo can not go up is this...</Title><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1348144729033</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 08:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, maybe so BUT there is another view, put out by "The Street" yesterday that suggests near term value as high as $25, once Yahoo defines how the 85% will go out, and longer term (let's use your 3 years for that) of possibly $45. @ sh.

The stock tanked when all she did was file to take a look at the agreement and plans to pass through the loot. Now that 85% is back on the table Mayer is "kind of being screwed over" ? They spent $500+M on stock purchases well ahead of receiving the Alibaba $. Mayer may well feel there is plenty yet to do in reducing payroll, developing new products etc. without going outside to spend a pile of cash. She is still working with the BOD on filling other top management posts. I, for one, see no reason to start carping about the use of the 85% especially when we do not even know the details.

BUT judging by his action thus far, he is loading up fast and furious in just few months while the stock is basically trading under $16. I believe Loeb has been buying close to 80M shares. And Yahoo has been buying 40M shares. So far, over 12% of the float has been taken off the market. I am guessing Loeb is probably putting together the $18 Billion as we type. The partners or financier can see he has a PLAN and putting the $$ behind it to take it private. Marissa already made the CATTLE CALL to start-ups that she will be buying like an incubator + venture capitalist (competing against other venture capitalists). Her focus will be wireless assets since everyone will be spending more screen time on smart phones + I phones, hence her giving away them to all Yahoo employees as a test operation for all new wireless technology assets acquired.</Msg><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1348152561938</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:49:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348152859017-47</Id><Topic><Title>What is Marissa Mayer's Top Secret Pet Project at Yahoo?</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1348114590837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 00:16:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A computerTV.</Msg><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1348152859017</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:54:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348153426387-48</Id><Title>Test</Title><Msg>Test</Msg><Username>lgnok</Username><Timestamp>1348153426387</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 11:03:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348153516954-49</Id><Topic><Title>What is Marissa Mayer's Top Secret Pet Project at Yahoo?</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1348114590837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 00:16:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whatever Mayer wants by December 1 has to be good.

It is going to take a corporate buyer with a lot of in house talent to take over and run Yahoo (or to figure out how to cut it up and sell the parts). I do not know if Yang really has that ability. I'm guessing that Loeb and Co. is a seller. He is more likely to take his profit and run than go in deeper. Prior to Loeb, I would have said that any successful offer had to be UNFRIENDLY. Now, with Loeb controling the Board, it is possible that the directors would vote to accept something in the low $20's. The offer would have to come BEFORE they spend of distribute their new cash.

Certainly hope MM can turn this thing around, but if she can't, BOD probably should have no hesitation to consider all other options to maximize investor value including aggressive cost cutting, sell non-performing/under-performing assets, etc.</Msg><Username>tiyang2</Username><Timestamp>1348168336208</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 15:12:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348168629499-104</Id><Topic><Title>Buybacks are Worthless</Title><Username>cjclink3</Username><Timestamp>1348152092625</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:41:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo needs to make the buyback and layoff at least 10,000 people.

Activist hedge funder Dan Loeb created this chart which shows the diminishing value of Yahoo's core business over the last seven years. He says the core businesses value has gone from $30 billion in 2008 based on the Microsoft buyout offer to $2 billion in the last six and half years. Loeb arrived at the value for Yahoo's core business by backing out the value of its cash, its stake in Alibaba (after taxes), and Yahoo Japan (after taxes). Importantly, this isn't necessarily a reflection of the true value of the business, just what the market thinks, says Loeb.</Msg><Username>lapetye</Username><Timestamp>1348178737575</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:05:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348179354287-130</Id><Topic><Title>Make no mistake, Yahoo will be sold for upwards of $35 when Yahoo Japan is settled</Title><Username>subsub_sonic</Username><Timestamp>1348178492139</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:01:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope you got that right !!
