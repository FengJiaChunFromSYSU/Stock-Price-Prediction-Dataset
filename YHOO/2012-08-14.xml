That is a tacit admission that their existing activities/business either aren't worth very much, aren't doing very well, can't be fixed or are so badly managed that they will soon be worthlesss. If Yahoo can't run what it owns now, what makes anyone think they willl do any better with an acqusition? Yahoo has some really serious managment and corporate culture problems. Anything they acquire will be contaminated by Yahoo; Yahoo won't be improved by the acquisiotns.</Msg><Username>pmaxx144</Username><Timestamp>1344917951958</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 00:19:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344921305563-3</Id><Topic><Title>2 hours into trading 13,000 $15 Sept calls JUMPING in VOLUME</Title><Username>evilwallstreet</Username><Timestamp>1344872206259</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:36:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>18,000 Sept $16 calls traded in ONE DAY= MONSTER VOLUME Someone just LOADED THE AIRCRAFT CARRIER.</Msg><Username>evilwallstreet</Username><Timestamp>1344921305563</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 01:15:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344921415291-4</Id><Topic><Title>2 hours into trading 13,000 $15 Sept calls JUMPING in VOLUME</Title><Username>evilwallstreet</Username><Timestamp>1344872206259</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:36:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>correction 18,000 Sept $15 calls</Msg><Username>evilwallstreet</Username><Timestamp>1344921415291</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 01:16:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344934491581-5</Id><Title>YHOO: BULLISH GRAVESTONE DOJI: CHART</Title><Msg>Click over now to: THECHARTMAN NET Sign up FREE if u want more of the following: BULLISH GRAVESTONE DOJI MONDAY Must have follow thru buying today signifies sellers are done and shift in control may be headed back to buyers watch 15.47 area closely needs to get back above GLTA DISC: NO COMP TheChartMan net If you donâ€™t know where you are in a stock, how can you know where you are going??</Msg><Username>chartman1135</Username><Timestamp>1344934491581</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 04:54:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344934603822-6</Id><Title>Terry Semel is back!!??!!</Title><Msg>"Chief Executive" redirects here.

What usually happens to the stock price of the acquiring comp on the announcement? Good purchase/bad purchase, etc., YHOO will end up 'paying up' for everything they 'buy' and it will take at least 2 yrs to 'return' anything. Hate to say it, this is a L-T strategic move to allow the CEO to 'spend'.....which is classic. The CEO is off the hook because she'll say "It will eventually pay off for YHOO shr-hlders." Key word is "eventually." I think this stock is headed towards a $14 handle....in a 'down mkt', faster than in a sideways one....regardless....it's going lower.

It must be assumed that part of the fanfare was for the possibility of a YHOO turnaround, no? Why would we need a hotshot just to unwind and distribute YHOO's assets? And if she were to to this, what would become of YHOO afterwards? We are losing the investors that bought for the quick money, plain and simple. The capitulation will cease, YHOO will stabilize, and MM will either succeed or fail. I believe she will succeed. I believe YHOO has so much potential.

Perhaps, Yahoo had to hire Mayer because Levinsohn was leaving anyway.... I am just surprised with the package and with difficult turn around ahead, pregnancy cannot be a good thing. For a regular company, it is okay, but Yahoo has lots of to do ahead ... I mean it is trading at zero value for its core business. that is just insane. Maybe DAn Loeb didn't care, because he is ready to taking Yahoo private. I mean, he could get a bunch hedgefunds together, buy Yahoo out for $25/share, which would be equivalent to 30 billion. They can then go directly to Yahoo Japan and Alibaba and further making deals ... they could potentially get to own and run Yahoo core for free. Dan Loeb may be just like, okay, whatever Marissa ... you pitch your plans and I will just buy Yahoo out and take it private. And then, Dan will be the puppet master and can do whatever he wants with billions of cash. I think Yahoo will be taking private. Yahoo Core alone can be sold to MSFT $10 to $15 per share. Without shareholders, it is easier for Yahoo to make the sells of its investments.</Msg><Username>fpl1971</Username><Timestamp>1344966165466</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 13:42:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344966208177-92</Id><Title>Bring back Yang!</Title><Msg>Bring back Yang!</Msg><Username>blogoncloud</Username><Timestamp>1344966208177</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 13:43:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344967193101-93</Id><Title>Google will buy Yahoo!</Title><Msg>Than Microsoft will come back to the table.

Why should shareholders be so trusting of MM that she will magically do the right thing after her nebulous "review"? This is business, not religion. Blind faith has no place in this arena. We will believe in her when she proves something to us. Anything. This is particularly so when "Yahoo" has been more like "yo-yo" in the past year, first looking to sell a minority interest in itself, then looking to sell back parts of its Asian holdings; going through 3 (so far) "permanent" CEO's and two or three interim CEO's in the past year; announcing that it was going to be a "media" company and then just a quickly announcing that it was going to be a "tech" company instead; telling shareholders (when board elections were about to take place) that the Alibaba money was going to be used for dividends/share buybacks and then suddenly indicating that it may be used to buy undisclosed businesses; telling everyone that Yahoo was going to get smaller, leaner and more focused by cutting certain parts of its operation and terminating thousands of employees and then suggesting recently that Yahoo will be expanding by buying out other companies and hiring potentially thousands of new engineers. . . And all the while the stock has been painfully flat for ages and ages -- with no definitive plan and an apparent reneging on the plan which had been announced. People who are YHOO shareholders can be accused of being a lot of things, but not being "ingrates" and not irrationally demanding "instant gratification." We've been patient, patient and more patient. So far, our patience has been anything but rewarded. And, although MM has admittedly been in command only a short time, the only thing MM has managed to do is to preside over the departure of the valuable Ross Levinsohn and deflate the price of YAHOO stock at a time when it finally seemed like it was going to move in a positive direction. Ingrates? I hardly think so. Yahoo shareholders are just like any other investors. We're looking for dividends or growth or both -- and we're looking for some sign that management knows what the hell it is doing. So far, the company is 0-for-3 in those categories. I continue to think this stock is undervalued and buy more on the dips. I bought 1,000 more shares today at $14.86, on the belief that the market will eventually value this thing at $18 or more. But we do need some help from the BOD and our new CEO. It's more than time to start producing some positive results.</Msg><Username>sjones8924</Username><Timestamp>1344973468162</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:44:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344973530213-131</Id><Title>Marissa - Look both ways when crossing the road tonight</Title><Msg>wouldn't want anything to happen to you :)</Msg><Username>marcpincass</Username><Timestamp>1344973530213</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:45:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344973669528-132</Id><Title>Someone please be a hero and go to yahoo</Title><Msg>all it takes is one person..................</Msg><Username>marcpincass</Username><Timestamp>1344973669528</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:47:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344973856710-133</Id><Title>How much is Loeb the Marissa licker down</Title><Msg>$100 million, the same that they are paying the stupid #$%$</Msg><Username>marcpincass</Username><Timestamp>1344973856710</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:50:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344973994060-134</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa Mayer will be the new Steve Jobs</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1343779195097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 19:59:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$16.37 to $14.69 in a week, that was fast.

Use the pile of cash and start buying back at these levels. If the BOD thinks they are undervalued by turning down $30 per share offers than the best investment they can make is in their own stock at half that.

I might now add another for unloading recently: To avoid a fat-tail event like the present one unfolding. To be sure, nothing significant has been implemented yet since her arrival at Yahoo but for the cumulative angst over what she will actually do next is what that is driving the stock down. Her penchant for a seeming dose of shock therapy is unnerving investors. Instead of planning to inject sudden and large doses of nostrums which will be hard on digestion, she should space out her revamping program. It is not right to put YHOO investors through the current wringer in mere anticipation of her next not so secret gambit that screams for total clarification...a more experienced CEO would have carefully avoided giving the impression of embarking on a regimen of shock therapy. ...to be continued...</Msg><Username>haurrible</Username><Timestamp>1344976608180</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 16:36:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344977273379-156</Id><Title>The only solution is to sell the comapny, not let a pregnant, young, inexperienced CEO play with YHOO money.</Title><Msg>Sell Y-JAP, get the AG money and then sell the core (let buyer have the $10 bil or so cash toward purchase of YHOO) etc. for $22 to $27 a share (a fair range)</Msg><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1344977273379</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 16:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344977303898-157</Id><Topic><Title>The dread splash-0-meter</Title><Username>haurrible</Username><Timestamp>1344976608180</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 16:36:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a test</Msg><Username>sgeneris1</Username><Timestamp>1344977303898</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 16:48:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344977547461-158</Id><Title>Third Point: Bigger Stakes in Apple and Yahoo</Title><Msg>A 13F filing revealed that Dan Loeb upping his stake in Apple and Yahoo!</Msg><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1344977547461</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 16:52:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344977699134-159</Id><Topic><Title>The dread splash-0-meter</Title><Username>haurrible</Username><Timestamp>1344976608180</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 16:36:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...continue...

Screw up ... indeed.</Msg><Username>fpl1971</Username><Timestamp>1344999195061</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 22:53:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345001720836-196</Id><Topic><Title>Levinsohn was the best thing happened to Yahoo ...</Title><Username>fpl1971</Username><Timestamp>1344999195061</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 22:53:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and now mayer is gonna hire herds of google rejects and call it "stealing talent".... yahoo didn't need an engineer as ceo............they let levinson get away........a communications guy, a sports news guy, a visonary guy with fox news, an innovator yahoo...........king of blunders!</Msg><Username>madcow_muffin</Username><Timestamp>1345001720836</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:35:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345001842146-197</Id><Title>I really worried</Title><Msg>Yahoo stock has dropped more than $1 after Marissa says she wants to re-evaluate Alibaba proceeds.
