But aren’t such oft-repeated comments gratuitous by now; apparently they are nothing more than hollow patches to a festering systemic malady. In truth, Draghi, the highflying EU near-equivalent of Fed’s Bernenke, sans wings (or at the very least whose wings are of a much minimized aspect ratio than Bernenke’s), could never spearhead any major policy initiatives without the blessing of EU’s paymaster in Berlin. However, Merke and her fellow Germans at large remain 4-square against any radical remedy à la a EU bond for example, while the austerity measures implemented thus far just keep on exacerbating the economic problems across Europe save only 4 (the Germans, Dutch, Finns n Luxembourgers). More pains are ahead for sure if the same old draconian measures stay in place. Furthermore, leading EU politicians would brook no discussion of even any limited membership divorce while in the same breath created angst amongst its lesser members over a predilection for a 2- speed Euro zone. Such are the political quandaries across the waters. As for YHOO, I have long cherished this stock since its last buyout debacle but decided now to book profit sooner than later, crucially for the following reasons (not in any particular order): 1) Expect content and ad rivalry with FB to intensify; partnership in these areas will not last. The recent smoothing over of patent squabbles is only a lull. If left alone, Yahoo will loose out to FB in revenue gains from mobile ads. In fact, FB’s earnings report indicates it did fare better than feared boasting a revenue increase of 32%, which I suspect is derived largely from mobile apps . 2) Considerable upfront advertising related expenditures may be in the works for Yahoo: It is unlikely the company could further monetise its present resources without ramping up marketing outlays or developing enhanced apps, or possibly scaring up new strategic acquisitions and alliances. Despite its recent ad sales improvement in the 2nd Q and the launch of its vaunted Genome ad-specific apps, the company’s 3rd Q is under pressure as projected earnings are pegged to be lower than the last. 3) US consumer spending is trending down for sure; 2nd Q GDP was adjusted downwards to 1.5%, with the third and the fourth, forecast at 1.3 and 1 respectively. The monthly jobless report for July this week could be a tipping point for many a market selling climax to come. 4) The EU wild card could derail not only Obama’s chance for re-election but also the domestic recovery. Spain’s latest jobless figure has further worsened so has Italy’s; Germany’s Ifo Business Climate Index continues to dip significantly lower over the past couple of months. Another major wild card with potential global impact that cannot be discounted is the Chinese economy as it hits the brakes. 5) Last not least, the odds of any renewed Yahoo buyout interest are nil, near- or median-term (either from Ballmer who did never recover from a serious paroxysm of Yahoo nerves since 2009, or Jack Ma who is busying himself with the preparation for the IPO grand debut of his brainchild in 2015 ). These odds have further dissipated following the ‘permanent’ installation of the now scrupulously vetted CEO who carries with her a potential price tag of $117 mil upon her satisfactory completion of tenure. (Godspeed then to probably the world’s first primiparous multi-million-dollar head honcho of a major public corporation; willy-nilly her every move as CEO will be amplified and scrutinized all the more.) Good luck all, whatever your strategy.</Msg><Username>doggonedogeatdog1</Username><Timestamp>1343655256171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 09:34:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343658178250-4</Id><Topic><Title>The facile Mario stock lift that was</Title><Username>doggonedogeatdog1</Username><Timestamp>1343655256171</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 09:34:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice to read something here worth responding to. i see great potential of difficulty for all in the near future.</Msg><Username>ydkmatall</Username><Timestamp>1343658178250</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:22:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343661075572-5</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa Mayer Gearing up for Mobile</Title><Username>mb525799</Username><Timestamp>1343543445577</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 02:30:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BEWARE: my sources tell me you are Eric K.

Fire a lot of people. This was one of Marc Andreessen's first suggestions to Marissa after he heard she was hired. He said she should can about 10,000 people. 2. Steady as she goes with Alibaba and ensure a deal with Softbank is struck for the Yahoo! Japan stake. It's likely Mayer won't play a big role in the monetization of the Alibaba or Softbank. That's because the talks are probably already well under way. She just needs to ensure they follow through and that the cash proceeds are used to substantially shrink the outstanding shares. Again, it's likely the board will take the lead on that. 3. Breathe new life into core properties. Yahoo! Finance, News, Sports, and OMG are huge in the desktop world. Ensure they get their due in mobile. Turn Flickr into an Instagram killer. Or spin it off to Twitter in exchange for an equity stake and strategic partnership with Twitter. 4. Do some interesting acquisitions that show Yahoo!'s a leader in mobile and cool again. There's not unlimited cash for deals, but there is no shortage of companies out there that would rapidly change the perception of Yahoo! to ultra-cool. Potential M&amp;A targets should include Yelp(YELP_), TripAdvisor(TRIP_), Kayak Software(KYAK_),Zillow(Z_), Pandora(P_), StockTwits, WhatsApp, Flipboard, Pulse, Gravity, HomeAway(AWAY_), Gilt Group, Martha Stewart(MSLO), OpenTable(OPEN_), Path and Pair. 5. Fix the core technology. There are a lot of fingers in the dike that no one sees except Yahoo! engineers. Nevertheless, this needs to be fixed. 6. Take Yahoo! back into search by agreeing to take over Bing from Microsoft(MSFT_). This would be the most radical move Mayer could make and would undo Carol Bartz's 2009 decision to outsource search to Microsoft except for the front-end look-and-feel (whatever that means).</Msg><Username>cul8eral</Username><Timestamp>1343667787935</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 13:03:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343669683631-13</Id><Title>Egad!
