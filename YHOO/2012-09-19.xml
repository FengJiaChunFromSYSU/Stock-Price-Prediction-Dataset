(Now confirmed: see below) "They're not concerned at all. They're happy to have a party with black people drowning," Chalian said over a break during the ABC News/Yahoo News webcast, in reference to the fact that the GOP convention in Tampa is taking place as Hurricane Isaac makes landfall on the north Gulf coast. (PHOTOS: 5 crazy convention moments) The conservative media watchdog organization NewsBusters first posted audio of Chalian's remarks, but referred to him as an ABC News employee (and offered slightly inaccurate transcription). ABC News spokesperson Julie Townsend informed the organization that Chalian was with Yahoo.</Msg><Username>haiku_blossom</Username><Timestamp>1348057587845</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 08:26:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348058103347-22</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo owns 23% of Alibaba Group, 35% of Yahoo!

If we spend the $3.6 billion on buybacks, we'll reduce the share by 18%. The analysts, all of who have a "wait and see" attitude on a stock like Yahoo, will simply lower their multiple by 20%. It's very arbitrary for them. That's why so many underperforming stocks, show nothing to the average shareholder, after massive buybacks. Can't believe they would do that, after 3 years of no stock growth. Also, the BOD will issue lots of new free shares to themselves. The rich get richer, and the dumb retail shareholder stays in neutral. #$%$ if this happens.</Msg><Username>cjclink3</Username><Timestamp>1348061611814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:33:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348061692429-29</Id><Topic><Title>Notice HOw They BeatchSlap it DOWN at $16?

Stocks (as you know, no preaching) are valued based upon the cumulative future earnings and distributing cash does not necessarily have anything to do with that. It can be argued that a $2-$3 special dividend is simply a catch up for all of the years when a dividend could have been paid but was not. Also, along with the special dividend I expect Yahoo to announce a regular quarterly dividend. Along with a share buy back (which will reduce the cost of the dividend) the share price will not go down (IMHO) by the amount of the special dividend but will in fact go up to reflect the new yield. Managements do in fact manipulate their share price by doing such things but they do work in the market and do enhance shareholder value immediately and over time. .</Msg><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1348062546512</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:49:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348062740934-32</Id><Topic><Title>$6b in cash</Title><Username>madcoweater1</Username><Timestamp>1348060390189</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:13:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you think the stock will NOT go down by the approximate amount of the special dividend, you are either fooling yourself, or you're just plain, old-fashioned Stupid!</Msg><Username>jmambo54</Username><Timestamp>1348062740934</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:52:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348062859351-33</Id><Topic><Title>Buybacks for Underperforming Stocks</Title><Username>cjclink3</Username><Timestamp>1348061611814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:33:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$3B buybacks only?

How will they do it?</Title><Msg>Yesterday's Yahoo! press release states that Yahoo has already bought back shares totaling $646million (about 41 million shares, +/- a couple million). These shares were acquired with "down payment funds over the past few months (I assume for between $14.70-$16.10). They will return another $3 billion to shareholders in one form or another. Based on the fact that they already started using funds from the sale (the down payment) to buy back shares, I think a substantial chunk of the 3B will be "returned" to share holders in buybacks. It the price of shares goes up then I expect a larger proportion of funds will be allocated as a dividend. So long as it is in the 15s or low 16s, I think they will get more bang for buck in a continuation of the buy-back program. But, this is only a piece of a plan that has not been outlined or defined to current or potential investors, So, even with money in the bank, Yahoo! still appears to be "on hold" From Yahoo release: Yahoo! will return approximately $3.65 billion in after-tax proceeds to shareholders, or 85 percent of the net cash proceeds from the initial sale of its shares in Alibaba. This amount includes $646 million the company has already returned to shareholders through share repurchases since the announcement of the transaction, as well as an additional $3.0 billion. After accretion from the Alibaba share repurchase, Yahoo! continues to own approximately 23 percent of Alibaba Group common stock, valued at $8.1 billion based on this most recent round of funding. Together with its preferred stock, the implied valuation of Yahoo!'s entire remaining stake is approximately $8.9 billion.</Msg><Username>firsttestcase</Username><Timestamp>1348065702377</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:41:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348065757141-51</Id><Topic><Title>DJIA &amp; NASDAQ SURGE HIGHER.....YAHOO IS SOLIDLY IN THE RED!!!</Title><Username>jmambo54</Username><Timestamp>1348065066769</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:31:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sentiment is all wrong, buy buy buy</Msg><Username>option_splat</Username><Timestamp>1348065757141</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:42:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348065882559-52</Id><Topic><Title>Buybacks for Underperforming Stocks</Title><Username>cjclink3</Username><Timestamp>1348061611814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 09:33:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only problem I have with special dividend is the tax, especially shareholders whose cost basis is near the current price.</Msg><Username>tiyang2</Username><Timestamp>1348065882559</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:44:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348065940761-53</Id><Title>When MSFT paid a $3 special dividend the share price stayed the same</Title><Msg>So, for those who insist that the YHOO share price will drop by the same amount as the special dividend I do not see any recent historical evidence of such a prediction.</Msg><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1348065940761</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:45:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348065958790-54</Id><Title>Oh darn</Title><Msg>Got my 16 finally.

Japan = $3.7 billion after tax (almost $7.3 billion pre-tax per most recent stock market quote) 3) Previous Net cash position after debt = $2 billion (before recent sale of Alibaba stake) 4) Cash from recent sale of Alibaba stake = $4.3 billion Adding all that together gives us a rough valuation of $15.5 billion for these parts, and the rest of the Yahoo! businesses are valued at about $3 billion? These Yahoo! businesses and properties are generating about $1 billion in annual profits, which are flat-lining after decreasing for many years.

Which I'm not saying it is but that provides a benchmark to value the last half of the stake. The value of the yahoo japan stake is too low after tax. The core businesses were last generating $700 million I believe, which has been declining the last 3 or 4 years if I remember correctly. So I'm not saying 3 billion is undervalued for this, but how much would you pay for a business that continually drops in earnings/cash flow. Hoping that Mayer turns this core business around. Yahoo has lots of assets and lots of opportunities to team up with partners. Would like to see them get rid of the non-core assets that have value but aren't making money. This would help show a true core business number and provide extra cash.

I don't mind if I have to pay a monthly fee. 6) more later on. So for all these reasons so far, please don't buy YHOO so I can save and buy more YHOO. This is the most under appreciated stock so don't buy let those who appreciate YHOO's services buy it. CNBC did not even mention one time about YHOO.</Msg><Username>lafrc</Username><Timestamp>1348105346846</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 21:42:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348105352050-177</Id><Title>don't buy YHOO.</Title><Msg>Why buy YHOO? 1) It has cash 2) It has established business 3) It has no news even with today $3.67 per share to the shareholders did not make the CNBC news. 4) I used it all the time, watch YHOO news, videos, web page, shops, buy and sell base on finance (Keep It Simple). 5) Even if YHOO want to charge monthly fee for me to use it the email, provide that it is more secure and can have access to more things.

DELL goes to $10 so what, I have to be in for the pop to $12-15 however, and so I will wait. No margin here folks, just plain old investing in beaten up companies, that will reap future rewards. Dell will reap on many new upgrades to PC computers going forward. Mine is a 2005 Vista prgram! Still running strong on DELL. Wer'e not all AAPL folks you know, we're the 99%! Good luck, over and out, see you all's higher!
