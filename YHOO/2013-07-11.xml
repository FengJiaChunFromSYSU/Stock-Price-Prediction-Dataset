They sold HALF of their AG stake which amounted to $3.50 of earnings or whatever. Their real PE is 26.56/1.18 in est. earnings(close to it anyway)=22.5. They're NOT a "growth story" by any stretch of the imagination as last quarter was a forecast DOWN YOY in growth and otherwise has been a FEW PERCENT growth the last few years, even large Google and MSFT were growing 25-30% in the last few years. As for "upgrades" they're like a'holes everyone has one and more often then not used to dump institutional shares on the less fortunate retail who after reading your topic are lemmings. I have shares from the $25 range, after dumping most at $27 in the Tumblr buy, and calls from the $25.30 range that have since doubled so not a "bash" just you don't anything apparently.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1373526904375</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 03:15:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373527065405-2</Id><Topic><Title>P/E less than 8.

Over the last four quarters, CCUR has grown operating income from $0.187mm to $0.413mm to $0.876mm and to $1.233mm, for total growth of 559%. CCUR just increased its dividend by 100% to $0.48 for a yield at $7.87 of 6.1%! You would expect a very profitable, rapidly growing company, with tons of cash and such a HUGE dividend to be trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of at least 2 or 3, but because CCUR is completely undiscovered - it's trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of only 0.74. CCUR has only 8.754mm shares out, $22.37mm in cash, no debt, an enterprise value of $46.52mm, with trailing revs of $63.23mm. Massive consolidation is taking place in the pay-TV industry, with rumors swirling about the next cable TV operator to be acquired. CCUR is one of the top tech vendors serving pay-TV operators. CCUR is the video on demand (VOD) market share leader with a VOD reach of 50 million households. CCUR also holds the largest market share for start-over/look-back network DVR services. Plus, CCUR provides the leading Big Data Analytics solution used by pay-TV operators, with CCUR's technology tracking the behavior of 35 million pay-TV subscribers. ARRS was rumored to be interested in acquiring CCUR in the past and with industry consolidation gaining huge momentum, CCUR could become a top takeover target. CCUR's rival Seachange (SEAC) has been seeing its fundamentals weaken while CCUR's profits rapidly grow, yet SEAC is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.74, which would value CCUR over $15. CCUR is about to explode past its 52-week high of $8.45 and into double digits. Pay-TV operators are rushing to upgrade to IP-based content delivery networks (CDNs) and CCUR's new CDN video technology was just selected by Time Warner Cable and Virgin Media! CCUR's 4Q results next month could be HUGE!</Msg><Username>rblatuis</Username><Timestamp>1373530317604</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 04:11:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373530790994-10</Id><Topic><Title>Undiscovered Tech Gem, Rapidly Growing Profits, Paying Huge Dividend, Ready to Explode to New Highs!</Title><Username>rblatuis</Username><Timestamp>1373530317604</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 04:11:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SPAM TROLLING PUMPER IGNORED!</Msg><Username>mel_houseboy</Username><Timestamp>1373530790994</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 04:19:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373536399876-11</Id><Topic><Title>UPDATE: Citigroup Initiates Yahoo! at Buy and $30 PT on Attractive Valuation, Near-Term Catalysts, $30 PT</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1373468584843</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 11:03:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That doesn't look like upgrade because Yahoo is at $27 already. upside $3 to $30, downside $27 has more room to fall.</Msg><Username>horse4chmn</Username><Timestamp>1373536399876</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 05:53:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373536688222-12</Id><Title>Earn An Extra $4500 Working Part Time From Home</Title><Msg>This online system is producing massive results. thousands of people have fired their boss and now make $500 per day working from home and today is your chance to see how they are doing it. this is the real deal.

I don't trade weeklies as I'm not an ADHD trader and with decay its either a homerun or nothing. I don't recommend front month options either for the same reason. 2-3 months out I'm comfortable trading since I watch them every minute and decay is slow. Stick to options ITM with a delta of .60 or higher meaning for every $1 move you gain .60. I would recommend a bull spread but $50 as a strike price around 2015 can't have much premium to it...sell the $50's to subsidize the $30's for example and make a max $20 per option. Ultimately, do what works for YOU and if you have discipline, keep emotion out, you'll be a great trader.

Who gets the most benifit out of it - Rich and high middle class and moderate high middle class. Who lose - everyone except that mentioned. Where we get the news from - rich and high middle class. What the rest of classes telling- SUCKS and there are almost social economical problems at every steps. Let me ask you this - Is stock game for rest of the class? Fed annoucement AND positive economic calander data ( some of them I do not think are positive when you consider the flip side of the data). Do we really count on somewhat data to raise the stock index so high. Are the few big companies will rate the rest of the USA? There are so many well known companies went really down after really high all year long. Who can really play long term - people who has extra money or lots of money. People who has little or moderate hard earning money - do they really stay on the market after losing trend. They can't have patient. They cannot afford. I think either way market will go down badly which is set for the end of the year probably regardless of any speech. Who has the upperhand on big trends already. People who already have access about the data of the companies, people and goverment. Some has preffered access may be. If someone has 100000 shares and another person has only 5 shares - who is controlling the price and the trend which may be aligned with some fake data news. Sometimes another person will be lucky. What is the truth behind and why so many people are pretending? FUNNY. My suggestion to play high volume stocks (over 5 millions these days) where not few can control. If you really look at the trend, market is up for 13 days straight. Why it has to be his way. Why creating stock market momentum this way. Why we can not have normal market trend? Even Bio stocks are becoming political. So many vague news and so many legal lawsuits Guys - I do not think so many things plays in the stock market.</Msg><Username>faz239</Username><Timestamp>1373597725180</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 22:55:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373599614726-90</Id><Title>Yahoo should acquire Pinterest</Title><Msg>They should use their awesome balance sheet to go buy some growth where it is booming.
