The bill, authored by Georgia Republican Tom Price and co-sponsored by 114 other House members, is just two pages long and claims its purpose is to "prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from enforcing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010." Section 3 of the bill simply states that the Treasury Secretary, or any delegate thereof, "shall not implement or enforce any provisions" of the 2010 health care law. Price explained the bill in a statement: As we've seen in recent announcements from the White House, the Obama Administration is clearly unable to manage the implementation of its own health care law. We've also learned that the IRS is clearly unable to prudently and impartially enforce current law. The Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act is essential in preventing further targeting, abuse and harassment, as well as in ensuring Americans have access to quality health care.</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1373456970959</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 07:49:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373457807482-18</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba: the company has intensified its meetings with investment banks over the past few weeks</Title><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1373430052129</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 00:20:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So Yahoo gets nothing from the IPO?

In the report, Citigroup noted, “Given the attractive valuation and what we see as near-term catalysts in the expected IPO of AG and potentially additional large repurchases, as well as the optionality represented in a possible core Yahoo! turnaround and/or liquidity of the Yahoo! Japan stake, we are initiating coverage of Yahoo with a Buy rating. Our 12-month price target of $30 represents 18% above from current levels and is based on our sum-of-the-parts analysis of core Yahoo!, Alibaba Group and Yahoo! Japan that we view as reasonable, if not conservative(see Figure 7). Our upside scenarios derive price targets in the $30-35 range.” Yahoo! closed on Tuesday at $26.67.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1373468584843</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 11:03:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373468627048-37</Id><Topic><Title>Remember what happens every friggin earnings!</Title><Username>johnberchick</Username><Timestamp>1373467893464</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 10:51:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jaggoff, I'm talking intraday and/or within a day or 2 after earnings.

It helps a bunch of over educated and bored IT types at Yahoo justify their jobs. Think of it as like a government Bureaucracy like the EPA. In their early days they did some great work that made huge differences and were very cost effective. But as time went on they were just sitting there fearing they were no longer needed. So they proceeded to look for new things to regulate even though it would result in huge costs to the economy with little affect on the environment..

Most of us live in much smaller towns like Milwaukee or St. Louis, or in the suburbs. And many if not most of us get our news from local papers, small- and medium-sized publications whose online stories probably aren't glamorous enough to be aggregated by the Huffington Post. And while this may come as a shock to some media bigwigs, many of us out in the hinterlands are actually interested in local news. Sure, we want to keep up with the war in Afghanistan and the fight over the budget deficit. But if I want to know how the public schools that my kids attend are doing, or find out if my property taxes are going up, or know whether the local zoning board approved a new mall on the edge of town, chances are I'll need to check my local paper for that. And who's to say that people wanting such local news wouldn't be willing to fork over something for it, either by paying for access to the paper's website or by subscribing to the print version and getting free access to the website thrown in?

Question to you: Which visitors are more valuabe, visitors, who want to buy or want tor read a newspaper?</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1373491217987</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 17:20:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373493243823-73</Id><Topic><Title>Needham Raises Yahoo PT to $28, Reiterates Buy Rating</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1373474452392</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-10 12:40:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YHOO is 27, it needs to raise to 35, so you have a room to run up.
