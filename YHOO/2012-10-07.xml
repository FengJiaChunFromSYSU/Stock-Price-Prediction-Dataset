They may still be at Google, they may have moved to companies like Facebook or Dropbox, or they may have started their own budding enterprises like Optimizely. But in some sense they are all Marissa’s acolytes. It would be not be surprising if some of these baccalaureate APMs wind up at Yahoo. In addition, former APMs all have their own networks, and can tip off Mayer to promising hires. Naturally, one of the first e-mails that Mayer sent after accepting her new job was a blast to the entire APM network, informing them of her move and assuring them that she will still be in touch. She reminded them that they are all part of a very special family. And Mayer would presumably be happy to welcome some of these family members to her new home at Yahoo.</Msg><Username>gregg.fumanti</Username><Timestamp>1349627106612</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 12:25:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349627771407-7</Id><Topic><Title>What did you say when coldone told you to buy at $11, $12, $13 and $14, hotmodel?</Title><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1348080744585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:52:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dr.gloom, you are acting like hotmodel with your irrational posts.</Msg><Username>opengslide</Username><Timestamp>1349627771407</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 12:36:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349627995460-8</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo to Layoff 1500 Employees</Title><Username>mb525799</Username><Timestamp>1349467811367</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 16:10:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wall Street will welcome layoffs at Yahoo.</Msg><Username>opengslide</Username><Timestamp>1349627995460</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 12:39:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349629414146-9</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa Mayer Has a Secret Weapon | Wired Business</Title><Username>gregg.fumanti</Username><Timestamp>1349627106612</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 12:25:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why don't these 300 contact her and try to get her to move where they are?

Massive layoffs. Marc Andreessen says Yahoo needs to fire 10,000 of its 18,000 full-time and part-time employees. I've heard the same figure from a source inside Yahoo. Mayer didn't bring up layoffs at her all-hands meeting with Yahoo employees to announce her turnaround plan for the company, but I was told by a source familiar with her thinking that the only reason for this was that the day was supposed to be a positive day. Layoffs remain a likely move for her. She recently hired a CFO, Ken Goldman, who is a noted cost-cutter.</Msg><Username>ashton10shyof</Username><Timestamp>1349632529622</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 13:55:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349632749731-13</Id><Title>W increased gov spending 2 times as much as Obama has</Title><Msg>W's 1st budget ...$1.9 trillion W's last budget....$3.2 trillion obama's 1st....$3.2 trillion ...............2012..$3.6 trillion kinda obvious who did the bigger increase of spending, isn't it? the increase in federal spending under Obama is dwarfed by the colossal increase under President Bush. federal government spending under President Bush increased 2X as much as it has under President Obama.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1349632749731</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 13:59:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349633578963-14</Id><Title>Obama still doesn't get it!!</Title><Msg>Higher tax rates results in lower tax revenue!
