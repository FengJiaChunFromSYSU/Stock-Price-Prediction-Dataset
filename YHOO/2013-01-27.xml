BlackRock, the world's largest asset management company, has taken an $80 million stake in Twitter Inc, a person with knowledge of the deal said Friday. The six-year old social media company will not raise new capital as part of the private deal that values the firm at more than $9 billion. BlackRock will buy shares directly from early Twitter employees seeking to liquidate their stock holdings and options. Twitter's new valuation represents a slight rise from late 2011, when the company facilitated a similar tender offer with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia that valued the company at a reported $8.4 billion. Twitter sought investors for another tender offer last summer in the wake of Facebook Inc's botched initial public offering in May, but did not complete the deal until recently, according to people with knowledge of the situation.</Msg><Username>bhttsl</Username><Timestamp>1359263455300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 00:10:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359269919888-4</Id><Topic><Title>Pick the date Yahoo hits $21</Title><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1357141419508</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 10:43:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good earnings will make you right.</Msg><Username>logicteama</Username><Timestamp>1359269919888</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 01:58:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359272702582-5</Id><Topic><Title>Pick the date Yahoo hits $21</Title><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1357141419508</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 10:43:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Monday 1/28</Msg><Username>leestoller</Username><Timestamp>1359272702582</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 02:45:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359291429067-6</Id><Topic><Title>Stock of 013!</Title><Username>vooodooodoc</Username><Timestamp>1359249729999</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 20:22:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, it' the stock of the year alright.

One would think she had been diluteing YHOO by its performance instead of the announced big buy backs. See above re: "YHOO worth $28 a share today" (some say much more) yet it is barely $20 in very strong market.

Bloomberg reported they had hired 2 investment banking firms. Alibaba said they had hired no none. They didn't say "no comment". They said they had hired no one. If they in fact had hired someone this would be a false and mis-leading statement. It would have been better if they had responded with "no comment". So other than that....where is this "IPO plan" you refer to. Seems like rumor and speculation to me...which I guess is fine...but to jump to the conclusion based on a Bloomberg rumor (that was denied, not ignored, by Alibaba,) seems a bit like jumping the gun. And I fail to see why Jack Ma stepping aside is somehow proof of an impending IPO. If Mark Zuckerberg had done the same thing people would have been nervous. Show me another startup where the founder steps aside and then it is followed by an IPO announcement. I think some on this board are so long they are spinniing any news into being bullish. Go watch the Bloomberg interview with Marissa Mayer. In particular, start at the 16:00 minute mark when she is asked about competing companies that have mobile, mobile OS, browsers and social. And at 16:49 the question and reference of the "Four Horsemen" clearly makes her nervous as she starts rotating her foot. Once they move on to another question the foot stops. Something about that topic clearly made her uncomfortable.

Who gets the credit? That's the crucial question in advertising these days—particularly in Internet advertising, where it's easy to track clicks and links but often hard to pin down exactly which view of an ad drove a sale. Now Facebook is making it easier to show that an ad displayed on the social network led to a sale—even an ad seen days or weeks ago. The technology is called conversion tracking, and after years of testing the idea, Facebook quietly rolled it out to all advertisers in a little-noted move last week. The idea is pretty simple: Facebook creates a customized conversion pixel that advertisers place on a page—like a checkout page on an e-commerce site, or a signup page for a subscription, or an app-download page—where a consumer's taking the action they hoped their ads would prompt. That lets Facebook link sales to ad campaigns, showing in aggregate which ads generated the most response. Google has long had similar features, along with Google Analytics, a dashboard for doing deep analysis of users' actions on a website. But Facebook has rolled out something far more powerful that can consistently track users across mobile devices and desktop websites. It can do this because it has a single, unified identity for each of its users, who tend to stay logged in to Facebook far more than any other website. Google has responded by rolling out Google+. Often misunderstood as a social network, Google+ has been described by executive chairman Eric Schmidt and other executives as an "identity layer" across Google products. Its social features provide an incentive for users to log in with Google accounts. But they have yet to do so with anything like the consistency and frequency that Facebook users do.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1359338347961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:59:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359338448185-73</Id><Topic><Title>Facebook Has Opened Up A New Front In Its War With Google For The Future Of Advertising</Title><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1359338347961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:59:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Facebook experimented with conversion tracking in 2010, abandoning it and then rolling it back as a service restricted to its biggest advertisers. More recently, it has been combining a limited test of conversion tracking with a feature called Optimized CPM, which automatically tunes campaigns to specific marketing goals like product sales or app downloads, rather than crude link-clicking metrics. Those tests seem to be successful: On Tuesday, Facebook quietly announced that the feature was available to all advertisers around the world. Why does this matter? Google has dominated online advertising for a host of reasons, but the chief one is the measurability of its ads. When a user clicks on a link, that sparks a storm of data used by Google and its advertisers alike to tweak their next campaign. Search-engine marketing is now a science rather than an art. And because it is so easy for Google to show a direct link between a click and a sale, it has commanded the lion's share of online-marketing budgets, especially in direct-response categories. But any student of marketing knows that the demand funnel is long and complex, with multiple exposures to a message required to prompt a sale. Google dominates the end of the funnel, catching consumers when they are in a mood to buy (as they typically are when they type product-related keywords into a search box). Facebook, because of its ubiquity in people's daily habits, can play in the middle of the funnel, offering the kind of frequency marketers need to break through to ad-inundated consumers. And now Facebook can show how those ads lead to purchases—even if they don't happen in the moment a consumer clicks. Facebook still can't compete with Google at the end of the demand funnel. Its recently announced Graph Search is unsuitable for almost all product queries in its present form, save maybe for categories like movies and music. But if conversion data can shift some spending away from Google</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1359338448185</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 21:00:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359338564672-74</Id><Topic><Title>Facebook Has Opened Up A New Front In Its War With Google For The Future Of Advertising</Title><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1359338347961</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 20:59:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>or, more likely, from the billions of dollars of offline, unmeasured advertising spending that both Facebook and Google hope to capture—then Facebook stands to gain. ***This is unreal as this article used to take one post and now it takes 3?
