There's another "Train" I saw live in Grand Rapids back in October. Wayne "The Train" Hancock - great under-recognized Texas singer/songwriter with a very fine small band - no drummer - but you are still tapping your toes. He would be great for a party too. Texas Swing and Rockabilly with Country Blues done to perfection. Hard to find better music in the USA than in Austin and New Orleans. Heading South soon! MB - really Linkin Park? I would have figured you like one of those Filipino lounge bands prevalent in Bangkok, Singapore, Hong Kong, et. al. Usually have a good-looking semi-dressed Filipina singing that I take a liking to.

But once again, you placed another disingenuous post yesterday about my support of Scott Thompson. I clearly remember you never had anything negative to say about Thompson at first, but you started to squirm when the stock started moving up on "the street" warming up to him, on account of the cost cutbacks he was initiating, his track record at eBay/Paypal, and a lot of smart people saying this he had what it took to bring fresh ideas to Yahoo. Then, with him at the helm, the stock took a big jump on earnings, and your tired mantra and of the stock being in an interminable trading range was starting to get shot to pieces, as was your short position, or the game of semantics you play, where you no doubt own puts or sell calls rather than being short the stock. So you seemed thrilled to ask for his head in "resumegate," no doubt hoping the stock would take a dive on his getting fired, which it did. Lucky you, but don't confuse that with your imagined genius. I don't remember you ever having anything positive to say about Loeb either. It's no surprise that you claim to be long now ... after the stock went up. Your predictable MO of always being on the right side of the trade, along with berating others for their losses, their stupidity, their perversity, their body odor ... their mothers wear army boots ... BTW - the sentiment discosure box I check is often just a goof, and doesn't represent how I really feel about the stock, because it means NOTHING</Msg><Username>mrjojangles2</Username><Timestamp>1354738400572</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:13:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354738637486-85</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo will trade over $19 today</Title><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1354716960940</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 09:16:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When will Yahoo go to $20?</Msg><Username>trip23455</Username><Timestamp>1354738637486</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:17:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354739429748-86</Id><Topic><Title>Hedge Fund Billionaires Are Hoarding Yahoo!</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1354593084381</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 22:51:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I tend to agree - but statistical retraces to the previous low are common - enough to make $ with my short although freely admit that you are right so far.</Msg><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1354739429748</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:30:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354739676401-87</Id><Title>Yhoo settlement</Title><Msg>The mexicans said they are open for a settlement, offer them 10 tacos and 10 burritos.</Msg><Username>fdc17422000</Username><Timestamp>1354739676401</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:34:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354740148282-88</Id><Topic><Title>Yhoo settlement</Title><Username>fdc17422000</Username><Timestamp>1354739676401</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:34:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bet when they hired the US lawyers for their case against yahoo the lawyers must told them " The law suit has no merit...no way you can win.!

I never said anything before or after. You whined all summer then gave him credit for AG when the guy was still in training wheels. All I said about Loeb since September is he's the only one UP in Yahoo, I don't base much of my investment/trading decisions on hedge fund guys who may or may not still own, a quarter later. I do ask how I can be thrilled and have sway on this forum like its all powerful then in the next sentence say its not my genius or all powerful...which is it???

You've been negative on Yahoo for the last 2mos., making fun of its programming, I bet that being short is killing you huh? "Blown up" your account with improper risk management and position sizing. Funny, you tell Gloom about "ancient history" and yet here you are being the hypocrite.

I'm well aware that gang violence is never mentioned yet when a white kid shoots up the school its national news. My MO has always been the same, and MikeT, who was a long was a war vet would attest to that. The police officer was a classmate of my younger brothers and hits close to home. Berate WHOM??? Ones with countless ID's like Coldone that I've OUTED and talking s***? Those like Mewag who too talks s*** since I've outed his Dariencat ID? You who seemingly holds a grudge when I warned you about those options time and time again? If you respect me I'll respect you but you obviously can't so I won't...SIMPLE! Anything to get a pot shot in when I DON'T even TALK TO YOU! Let's see I put ZERO money down, wrote puts that gives me a $14.30+ avg., and have instead of a 30% return...an INFINITE one. Oh and I reinvested that money 4mos. ago somewhere else. I'd LOL too considering I will have $5 profit on no money down just from Yahoo. As for Detroit, no one is giving you "brownie" points for sticking it out...move to West Bloomfield or right outside The Somerset Collections in Troy. Put your cardboard box up and if you ever get on my good side(doubtful) I'll hook you up at Beztak properties, a socialite friend owns part of it. Detroit means s*** to me, its a dump, yet you bring it up in defense of my giving respects to a hometown hero...hows that any different? You take pride in Detroit but I can't in mine???

As I would guess your "socialite friend" is also boring. Money can't make people interesting, or humorous, or worthwhile. Not my kind of folks. Could care less about their money and their self-perceived status. The rest of us loathe them, for the most part. Often part of the 2% of the population "J-tribe" who got their money through family, nepotism, and government payouts and illegalities. The action is in the city. Detroit is coming back, and would come back even faster if we could get rid of both the criminals and the all-too-comfortable suburban crooks. I moved from Detroit a LONG time ago, but it is interesting to spend some of my time here again and work together with people here to bring this god-forsaken place back to at least some of its former glory. A little dangerous too. It could be worse. I could be stuck in Minnesota.

My friend donated all her money and has paid her own way through her wedding planning business. Her family does have homes elsewhere including in Michigan...Traverse City and Bay City. That being said she's not the wealthiest people I know. I DO agree with you on the socialite attitude as it irritates me. Fortunately, the other ones are very normal. The irony is I used to watch the Tigers with Trammell, Deer, and Fielder all the time when they played the Twins growing up. Texas Rangers being, the other, with Juan Gone, Pudge(my favorite catcher) and Palmerio. Their hits would bounce 30yds on the old Metrodome turf. Like the teams just not the city at the moment. Dan Gilbert, moved Quicken Loans there I believe and some big real estate developer wants to build ag farms. I think Detroit can't afford the electricity for the light posts, like other cities that I've read, which is dangerous. Still have no idea why you're on that "J-Tribe" rant but you're in the USA and its only place where you can be a billionaire, almost overnight, as Zuckerberg or Sara Blakely can attest to. Sorry I was the BOTTOM 1% before and that is no fun. I sacrificed a LOT just to get capital to trade and invest. When the journey is over I'll follow Buffett and donate it.
