The stock is completely under the radar and a reason why its 0.2 X sales valuation giving it a $6.5 million market cap. The company is already almost break-even even before the upcoming AMD-related windfall. DRAM has a strong balance sheet with ZERO long term debt. Per the agreement, DRAM will develop a special edition RAMDisk utility, which will be called AMD Radeon RAMDisk. AMD Radeon RAMDisk loading times are expected to be 525% higher than those offered by conventional products, increasing performance, eliminating bottlenecks and improving the gaming experience on the PC as well as other applications requiring fast processing like complex engineering simulation models. AMD Radeon RAMDisk utility will be available from October to December this year. DRAM develops, manufactures, and markets large capacity memory products primarily used in high performance network servers and workstations worldwide. The company has more than 70 Fortune 100 customers and it’s been in business since 1967.

AMD Radeon RAMDisk utility will be available from October to December this year, and although AMD or Dataram gave more details on its operation, we assume that this utility to create a RAM disk to use by way of a fast disk cache, based on the Game and application profiles present in the Catalyst Control Center utility, which comes bundled with graphics cards, motherboards (chipset) and AMD APUs. On September 14, 2012, DRAM stated the following in its fiscal 1Q 2013 earnings report: During this quarter the Company entered into two agreements which we expect will generate growth and profits for Dataram in 2013 and beyond: - An agreement with AMD provides for Dataram to develop and sell AMD licensed and branded versions of its RAMDisk software. AMD’s Radeon RAMDisk will target the gaming enthusiast community. - An agreement with Shoreline Memory Inc. ("Shoreline") and the other with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD") for the purpose of expanding our customer base and product offerings. The Shoreline Agreement provides for Dataram to fulfill 50% of the orders Shoreline receives from its primary customers. Management believes these agreements will provide new revenue sources and expanded markets for the Company's products. Mr. Freeman concluded, “These recent agreements and other new opportunities we are currently pursuing should provide new sources of revenue, profit and growth for Dataram in 2013 and beyond. The experience, knowledge and assets we have gained from our current RAMDisk product, in the development of caching software and in solid state products are building a strong foundation for growth.” DRAM is also an unrecognized cloud play. DRAM makes the XcelaSAN memory/storage family of products for cloud and all other applications. The company recently received $5 million from a Japanese company to allow the non-exclusive right to manufacture products using the XcelaSAN technology.

As soon as Yahoo sells of All their GROWING assets, and are left with ONLY NONGROWING assets, and once they blow all their money on whatever, as they have routinely in the past, the stock will dive and the takeover will occur but only for single digits.

I have been on this Board for about 5 years. Coldone, with any doubt whatsoever, was on the verge of an apparent breakdown as he was Down alot of money on Yahoo. He had bought alot of stock in the $30s. HotModel, at the very same time, was cleaning up on Option trades. Coldone was sooo Down, that he was CONSTANTLY asking HotModel for investment Help, but he couldn't understand when she tried to explain Option trading. Coldone got very upset and started posting trash about HotModel. He has been ever since. HotModel has been making money all the way Down fro the $30s, while Coldone was buying Big in the $20 and $30 range. I doubt he has any money left. I am not HotModel. Too bad Coldone can't say the same thing about his Hundreds of Aliases!!</Msg><Username>pearlprue</Username><Timestamp>1349891798074</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:56:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349892805504-69</Id><Topic><Title>Another one bites the dust...</Title><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1349890613239</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 13:36:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IF she is at home with her 10 day old baby, she should have TOLD THE BOARD she would be home with her 10 day old baby.

Management changes, cash to make changes, activist investors, rxperienced hires, etc. I am not sure what else you could ask out of them over the past two or three months since Mayer took the helm.</Msg><Username>kenrsmith2003</Username><Timestamp>1349905355498</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 17:42:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349905593184-104</Id><Topic><Title>Almost 12,000 $16 Oct calls traded today</Title><Username>brkout_volume_surge</Username><Timestamp>1349898830647</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 15:53:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>plenty of cash, new ceo and cfo and now a new cto will be added, i think this company will be alot more aggressive under new leadership. good things to look forward to in the not to distant future which the street will be pricing in shortly. thats my take.</Msg><Username>swilson1289</Username><Timestamp>1349905593184</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 17:46:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349908374194-105</Id><Topic><Title>If the company did a 3 billion dollar buyback hat percent of the float could they buy back at current prices.</Title><Username>kenrsmith2003</Username><Timestamp>1349901159025</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 16:32:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if you have an open mind, and not have clouded judgement, all of your "good" things, really aren't that good.... since 6/30/2010 YHOO is up 15%, the S&amp;P is up 40% you like management changes? how about 5 CEO's in the past couple of years. you like that?

The serial spammers are out in force posting their scams and then rating/bumping their own messages. They are still getting unlimited ID's. Some boards (GE or Facebook) have mostly political messages. I'm guessing that one of the "suits" sent the word down to not reduce the number of visitors to these boards, even if those visitors were trying to steal from paying advertisers and users, or posting political garbage having nothing to do with the company. It is too bad that Yahoo is unable to improve its miserable corporate culture.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1349909161982</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 18:46:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349912048217-107</Id><Topic><Title>What Should I do With YHOO...Buy, Sell or Hold?</Title><Username>hardinjane491</Username><Timestamp>1349882112055</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 11:15:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this here.</Msg><Username>beatricespears593</Username><Timestamp>1349912048217</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:34:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349912598025-108</Id><Topic><Title>Attention YHOO Shareholders</Title><Username>looklong</Username><Timestamp>882570190000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 1997-12-19 17:23:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Next time I want slanted/biased propaganda i know where to go "yhoo"....Since I prefer objective unbiased news, I made Google my home page.

The only thing retained from the old board format is the spammers with following or multiple ids. *Political vomit all over the BAC board renders it useless. I put all pols on ignore and had to go three pages to even find a post on BAC. *Something weird with the ignore user feature, also, in that for some of those posts. they are collapsed, for others you don't see them at all &amp; yet others there is no effect at all as user ignored is displayed and when you go back to the board, the user is still there. I do not come to the board anywhere near as frequently as I used to. I have tried a few other message boards but I used to really enjoy YHOO Finance message boards. Kind of nice when I'm a stockholder...
