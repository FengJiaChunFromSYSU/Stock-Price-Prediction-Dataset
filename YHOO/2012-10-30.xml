Damage was limited. Long term reconstruction won't add much demand compared to a slight pick-up in housing prices which is already causing a timber shortage since mills won't reopen until it is clear the market is on a long term up trend. Add in the fact that much of the western timber stock is being killed by pine beetles so that harvest will be reduced and there isn't much there. Plum Creak may be one option. But, until more mills open and the pine beetles writeoffs are taken, I'm not hot on it. Plum Creek used to have a great dividend though. I don't think there will be much additional demand for concrete. Home Depot and Loews would have been stock to stock up on before the storm, but I think they would be selling off today if the markets were open since people have already loaded their pantry. I think the story here is that there isn't much of a story. .</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1351602627011</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 09:10:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351606324234-6</Id><Topic><Title>NYSE has 3 ft of water on the exchange FLOOR !

Apple not having anyone to handle invalidity, I believe that all along that was Cisco/Desmarais' task in the joint defense. The trials were separated only a month or so ago, and I doubt someone from Williams' firm could pick up the baton of many months of work on Desmarais' part, hence the use of Desmarais to make the argument in the Apple case as well. I doubt that HJD will grant VHC's motion for collateral estoppel on Desmarais' participation, and if he does I'm not sure that Cisco will allow him to argue for Apple, but it very well might - he's ready to make the arguments (one assumes), and one jury is the same as another. To the extent that Desmarais establishes the patents as invalid in front of an Apple jury, that's significant precedent to establish the same in front of a Cisco jury. As I have no "Esq" behind my name, at this point it's above my pay grade, that's just speculation.</Msg><Username>o_p_money</Username><Timestamp>1351614655068</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:30:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351615588358-8</Id><Title>NYSE and NASDAQ Open Wednesday, October 31</Title><Msg>Business as usual tomorrow.</Msg><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1351615588358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:46:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351615604056-9</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo servers crashing</Title><Username>slickvguy</Username><Timestamp>1351282267538</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 16:11:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>check ur shorts..they may be too tight! both of them</Msg><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1351615604056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:46:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351616146551-10</Id><Topic><Title>NYSE and NASDAQ Open Wednesday, October 31</Title><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1351615588358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:46:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Prepare for a day with very heavy volume.</Msg><Username>thurstonthethird</Username><Timestamp>1351616146551</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:55:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351616462920-11</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo will trade above $17 next week</Title><Username>smedleypuddles</Username><Timestamp>1351263680938</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 11:01:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo is just getting started.</Msg><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1351616462920</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 13:01:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351618520127-12</Id><Topic><Title>NYSE and NASDAQ Open Wednesday, October 31</Title><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1351615588358</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 12:46:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo will see $17 this week.</Msg><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1351618520127</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 13:35:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351619879113-13</Id><Title>Where is the talking "Horses #$%$" Mr Ed this week..
