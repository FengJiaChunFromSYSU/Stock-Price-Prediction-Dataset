Let me explain further... We heard about the racial slurs that were directed at Obama within the Clinton camp during the 2008 primary presidential election campaign. The Clintons have long despised Obama. Democrats actually have two competing main support groups within the Democratic Party not counting the black caucus. for example candidates such as Kerry and Obama were with Ted Kennedy; and on the other side candidates such as Al Gore and Howard Dean were with Bill Cliinton. Both sides are socialist but both are both power hungry and jealous of each other, which is very typical of Democrats.

My advice is avoid webmail like yahoo, google, hotmail, aol, and juno. many scan your email and sell your personal information. If your internet provider may provide you with your own email address, us eit instead. Or register your own domain through like godaddy and get a subscription for service and use MS Outlook. It doesn't cost much and it's yours.
