I got two friends to open scottrade accounts. And 3 others to put money into fnma. One of the poor guys listened to me a year ago and bought in, only to sell out around .29 couple of months ago. Heas seen the upside and got back in at .75. Funny story though one friend sold his Hunting bow and asked me to buy him shares since his wife won't let him speculate on the stocks. So he owns 183 shares. He made 12.22 cents today on his first investment. Pretty good return on investment I think! He should be able to buy a newer bow soon!</Msg><Username>christalhess</Username><Timestamp>1363759635472</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 02:07:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363764242550-3</Id><Title>Je N'est cest pas Mayer</Title><Msg>Pour quoi?

If not, Microsoft has to make up the difference. The agreed RPS has never been reached since the deal began. This became a big issue last year, when Yahoo got louder about blaming Microsoft for the deal not producing the anticipated revenues (see The Yahoo Search Revenue Disaster). Microsoft is on-the-hook to pay a guaranteed minimum amount. Those guarantees were set to expire on March 31 of 2012, but in October 2011, Yahoo announced that Microsoft had agreed to continue paying guaranteed amounts through March 31 of 2013, for search activity happening in the US and Canada. This is the escape clause.....They will either renew or get a much better deal is MSFT or totally change partners....what are your thoughts?</Msg><Username>crosscourt11</Username><Timestamp>1363783740686</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 08:49:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363784294293-5</Id><Title>Why I'm Buying MBI</Title><Msg>Good price to add to a stock that will $26 overnight with a capital raise or a settlement.</Msg><Username>tommiegun53</Username><Timestamp>1363784294293</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 08:58:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363785539377-6</Id><Title>FNHC - Article just issued, trading at 30% the value of its invest port and no debt - seeking alpha.</Title><Msg>Invest port is growing at 13% alone and then you add in positive growing earnings dividend just raised..

There is a building on Stanford's campus with the name Li Ka-shing . There was a partnership between Wal*Mart and "WHO" in 2006 on a port in Mexico? Greg Penner went to Stanford. Never think for a minute that ignorant rich from the hills of the Ozarks can't have an agenda. 1975 was the last year America had a trade surplus. Marissa was born that year. That means for every year that she has been on this earth more and more US dollars have been going to foreigners and less and less have been coming back to US. oh! Sam Walton was in Seoul in 1975. Jimmy Hoffa disappeared in 1975. Social Security was pegged to inflation in 1975. President Ford appointed G. W. H. Bush to be the US Liaison Office in the People's Republic of China in 1975. OH! one more thing... US Government Debt was a mere $533 billion in 1975. and this was after President Lyndon Johnson took the Government from "Off-Budget" to "On-Budget" in 1968. You young Americans had better wake up....you are running a $40 billion a month trade deficit, have a 6 to 1 trade deficit with China and Ben at the Federal Reserve is having your US Treasury printing %85 billion George Washington's each month whch is putting all you young people deeper and deeper in debt. and most of you have no idea because for the past fifty years the American consumers have been brainwash that if they purchase foreign made so-call cheaper....they will become wealthier.... duh! there were not 46 million Americans on food stamps nor 20 million Americans unemployed in 1975. This company is for propagandist socialism ..... Retail makes NOTHING.....it can only move a countries currency. Wal*Mart's Global Procurement Office is in China. Wal*Mart puts less than 5% foreign in all their stores in China.</Msg><Username>madmilker70</Username><Timestamp>1363785564585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:19:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363786053764-8</Id><Title>Yahoo downgraded at BGC .</Title><Msg>Any thoughts ?</Msg><Username>lyonsaudit</Username><Timestamp>1363786053764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:27:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363786585414-9</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa Ann was sitting on Wal*Mart's Board of Directors before being appointed CEO</Title><Username>madmilker70</Username><Timestamp>1363785564585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:19:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$85 billion. sorry about that.... wake up!</Msg><Username>madmilker70</Username><Timestamp>1363786585414</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:36:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363786780479-10</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo downgraded at BGC .</Title><Username>lyonsaudit</Username><Timestamp>1363786053764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:27:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Colin is either an idiot or wants a pull back to buy more.

The startup’s mission was to help connect people to the physical world around them, a mission for which it released an iPhone app late last year to help connect people with recommendations about things to do, stuff to eat, books to read and movies to watch.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1363795225752</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 12:00:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363795397197-39</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo!

My take is that decision is already been made and the announcement will come soon. My speculation is that if MM can find a partner say FB or GOOG (gov’t approved of course the latter, MM is very closed to Obama administration) search deal with MSFT is no brainer “terminated”. But again, if MM terminates the search deal with MSFT without finding a partner then it will be huge responsibility to start all over again to get new a system in place back in Sunnyvale, hire engineers to run the business operations except the marketing. My personal opinion again, MM with CFO Goldman they can find a way to make it works for YHOO. We will see…YHOO going higher…. No sell recommendation, upgraded PT $26, last Q YHOO beat analysts consensus estimates, these are positives to YHOO going forward. Please this is just my personal opinion.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1363795660016</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 12:07:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363795672770-45</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo!

This has been a fun and furious journey for our tiny startup, as we applied our various technology backgrounds to recommendation and mobile app design. It's now time to move ahead to join a larger company, and Yahoo! is the perfect match. For the five of us who will be joining Yahoo! this is a coming home - we are all former Yahoos. Three of us left Yahoo! to pursue our passion at Jybe, and two of us took a longer path via other startups and search-engine companies. We can't wait to apply what we've learned about recommendation, personalization and the mobile experience to the hundreds of millions of people who come to Yahoo! every day. We look forward to (re)joining the world-class talent already working at Yahoo! and are excited to hit the ground running. To our awesome users, thank you so much for trying out the Jybe platform. We hope it made your life a little more entertaining. We will be closing down the Jybe service, but we are putting together a tool so you can download and keep all your data. We're eager to start applying everything we've learned and built to the Yahoo! platform, so stay tuned. Exciting developments are ahead!</Msg><Username>lutts</Username><Timestamp>1363804267989</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 14:31:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363804711807-86</Id><Title>any surge in yhoo and im shorting / buying every put i can</Title><Msg>this company has destroyed itself.. most loyal yahoo users know that. yes the numbers may loo good in the VERY short term , but in the near future this company will be the NEXT PRODIGY / A O L / NETSCAPE...its obvious to anyone who isnt stupid.</Msg><Username>r0ck3t</Username><Timestamp>1363804711807</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 14:38:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363804821699-87</Id><Topic><Title>any surge in yhoo and im shorting / buying every put i can</Title><Username>r0ck3t</Username><Timestamp>1363804711807</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 14:38:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The latest 40% surge wasn't enough for you?</Msg><Username>ashton10shyof</Username><Timestamp>1363804821699</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 14:40:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363804908276-88</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo!

Noting that Yahoo's stock has jumped 43% since May 2012, Gillis wrote that Yahoo! faces headwinds as it tries to increase the revenue generated by its core business. These obstacles may cause the Internet giant's stock to drop over the next few months, the analyst wrote in his note to investors. Changes the company made to its sales team are likely to weigh on the company's display revenue, Gillis stated. After Yahoo! reorganized its sales team in 2011, the company reported poor results for its June quarter and cited the changes as the reason for the weakness, Gillis noted. Another possible drag on the stock is a reduction in Yahoo!'s earnings from its Asian assets, as the company has reduced its stake in Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, the analyst added. Furthermore, Yahoo's search revenue sharing deal with Microsoft (MSFT) is set to expire at the end of March, and the looming expiration may weigh on Yahoo's guidance, Gillis contended. Yahoo! may begin buying companies at a faster pace, possibly impairing its ability to buy back more of its own shares, he stated. Gillis maintained a $21 price target on the shares. In early afternoon trading, Yahoo lost 0.6% to $22.</Msg><Username>wbobeli</Username><Timestamp>1363812592898</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:49:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363812710110-102</Id><Title>BEAR MARKET COMING SOON!
