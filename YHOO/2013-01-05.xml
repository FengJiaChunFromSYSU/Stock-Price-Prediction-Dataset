YHOO and Samsung are basically going to integrate a search results page into TV's, featuring relevant paid and organic links. Samsung's new screens will allow these search results to be shown fairly unobtrusively, at the very edge of the screen where on most TVs there is currentlyframing. YHOO's Soundprint technology (Into Now) will recognize the program you are watching. YHOO will serve links to relevant content in the sidebar as you are watching TV...pioneering a a new ad platform to reach TV viewers that bypasses the networks. YHOO will include personalized paid links tied to the program and the viewer's TV watching and app-using history. If this takes off this is huge....as revolutionary as Adwords or Facebook. YHOO will basically bring a search advertising platform to TV sets.</Msg><Username>argent_a_bend_gules</Username><Timestamp>1357397734038</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:55:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357397753389-4</Id><Title>Samsung should buy Yahoo and bury Apple as a hasbeen company.</Title><Msg>An offer of $32 by Samsung would get this done quick.</Msg><Username>tommy_loops</Username><Timestamp>1357397753389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:55:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357399074565-5</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung should buy Yahoo and bury Apple as a hasbeen company.</Title><Username>tommy_loops</Username><Timestamp>1357397753389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:55:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think $32 gets it done anymore.

Why would networks allow that to happen? You don't really think they'll let a 3rd party piggyback on all their billions spent creating content do you? If you're watching sports on ESPN for example I GUARANTEE any advertising dollars coming from links is going to their bottomline not Yahoo's. Are you suggesting Yahoo gets a cut? I don't think it'd be much at all and more of a technology licensing type deal. 2. That being said, we're on serious information overload. Take ESPN for example, they used to tell you a hitters batting average, strikeouts, on-base percentage but now it includes balls hit in play, runners in scoring position, their hot/cold sectors of their strike zone. Football used to be just yardage, ints, and TD's of the QB but now its gone from QB rating to a new metric in QBR taking to consideration how a QB does in the red zone. They've exponentially included the number of useless stats like that guy is the 1st Caucasian American from south central Minneapolis to hit a homerun at Target Field while overhead is less than 5 clouds. Who gives a s***!lol 3. There is nothing worse than annoying product placement and I certainly don't want to watch a continuous catalog on TV where my TV show was supposed to be. Nothing worse than an ad shoved in my face as Yahoo LOVES to do on its home page with its pop up ads. The ONLY way this comes to fruition is if Dish's fast-forward technology stands in Cali and NY where skipping ads completely is possible. Only then will networks have to go into the show itself. Downside is MOST people have more than the basic 5 networks so therefore pay for each channel. Quite a few people have simply got rid of TV altogether going the route of Netflix or Amazon. ***Are we forgetting this is the SAME TECHNOLOGY and Widgets that Bartz announced 3yrs ago and hasn't taken off???*** Glad you're still in Yahoo as you bring good discussions and I've only scratched the surface here as I got a Vikings playoff party to attend but your batting avg. hasn't been too good lately. Newco? MSFT paying tons of money for the 361' patent? That being said this is BY FAR the most interesting possibility I've read.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1357429434042</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 18:43:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357429542673-27</Id><Topic><Title>Only complete idiots post in a spam thread - leestoller and stillmydime</Title><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1357420523789</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 16:15:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Be quiet, hotmodel.</Msg><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1357429542673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 18:45:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357429832399-28</Id><Topic><Title>News alert!!!

The networks don't have any choice. Yahoo and Samsung are basically "framing" the TV network's content...and placing their own relevant ads within their frame. It's the equivalent of a web toolbar. A web toolbar can display its own ads as a user navigates from website to website. The websites don't get a cut of the toolbar ad revenue. And neither will the networks get a cut of the YHOO / Samsung ads that accompany or overlay the network content.IMO. "There is nothing worse than annoying product placement..." I agree. If this platform is to work, it must add real value to consumers, and the inclusion of paid links together with customer-desired organic links must be done very carefully and be skillfully personalized. But this is the challenge of every ad platform...whether broadcast TV, or the Google search results page, or the Facebook newsfeed, or Tweets....carefully managing the frequency and responsiveness of paid ads, interspersed with customer-chosen content, so consumers don't get turned off. I don't know if YHOO will be able to make this work. The point is, integrating in effect a search results page with TV content, that is personalized in real-time for the individual viewer and for the content that is being shown, is a MASSIVE business opportunity if done well...which could easily generate hundreds of billions in market cap. And YHOO looks to be a true leader in this space...we'll see how much so at CES this week.</Msg><Username>argent_a_bend_gules</Username><Timestamp>1357431068326</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 19:11:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357431354601-34</Id><Topic><Title>Pick the date Yahoo hits $21</Title><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1357141419508</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 10:43:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>January 28 before midnight.</Msg><Username>strumbollio</Username><Timestamp>1357431354601</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 19:15:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357433629465-35</Id><Title>NEGLIGENCE</Title><Msg>My account was hacked on Friday.
