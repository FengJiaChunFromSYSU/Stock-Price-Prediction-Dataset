SoftBank Corp. (9984), a Tokyo-based wireless carrier with a 35 percent stake in Alibaba, may see its market value boosted by as much as 75 percent as a result, according to Huttenlocher, whose Hong Kong-based company now manages $2.3 billion of assets. Alibaba may have an IPO this or next year that values the Hangzhou, eastern China-based company at as much as $100 billion, rivaling the $104 billion Facebook Inc. got at its May 2012 IPO (FB) price, analysts including Eric Qiu at Guosen Securities Co. have said. Facebook has a market value of $55.5 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Alibaba, which made founder Jack Ma a billionaire, will benefit from China’s expanding retail market, increasing use of Internet and smartphones, and a fragmented retail market, Huttenlocher said. Ma said last year that the company may go public within five years. “It’s much easier to gain share in a fast-growing pie,” he said at the first Karen Leung Memorial Investor Conference in Hong Kong yesterday. “The e-commerce market in China is an enormous and very fast growing market that we feel is also getting share from the offline retail market. Alibaba is the dominant company in the sector and has pricing power.” Internet Buying Retail sales in China are growing 14 percent a year, against 3 percent in the U.S., Huttenlocher, a former Asia head of New York-based Highbridge Capital Management LLC, said. About 42 percent of Chinese use the Internet now, compared with more than 80 percent in the U.S., he said. The top 20 traditional offline retailers in China command less than 10 percent of the market share, lower than the 40 percent to 50 percent in the U.S., he said.</Msg><Username>theretirementdr</Username><Timestamp>1370601067052</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 06:31:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370604192944-5</Id><Title>US house republicans vote to limit Homeland Security's buying huge lots of ammo</Title><Msg>Republicans do something to put an end to Homeland Security buying huge amounts of ammo to deliberatly create shortages to prevent US citizens from being able to by it.

They just announced that they are doubling their quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 to $0.12 with their first $0.12 quarterly cash dividend being paid to shareholders later this month! This equals an annual dividend of $0.48 and CCUR closed yesterday at only $7.08 for an unbelievably HUGE dividend yield of 6.8%! According to Current Analysis, CCUR's Mediahawk VX video on demand (VOD) server technology just surpassed Cisco (CSCO)'s CDE 250 to become the #1 highest rated VOD product used by pay-TV companies! Over the past 4 quarters, CCUR's operating profit has increased from $187,000 to $413,000 to $876,000 to $1,233,000 for growth over the past year of 559%! CCUR's profits could continue to soar this quarter with the recent signing of a HUGE new deal with Virgin Media! CCUR's CDN technology is supporting their new Virgin TV Anywhere multi-screen service, which delivers linear and on demand TV to the smartphones and tablets of Virgin's 3.8 million subscribers! Last quarter, excluding share-based compensation and non-cash amortization, CCUR earned non-GAAP EPS of $0.16! This puts CCUR on track to earn non-GAAP EPS of $0.64 this calendar year! A P/E of just 20 to 30 based on potential full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.64 would make CCUR a $12.80 to $19.20 per share stock! CCUR is currently trading with an enterprise value of only 5 1/2X cash flow!</Msg><Username>jowslir632</Username><Timestamp>1370633591438</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:33:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370634026124-62</Id><Title>What's up with the Yahoo Finance Message Board Links</Title><Msg>why don't they work on some of the boards? that has to be an easy fix.</Msg><Username>rromanoo</Username><Timestamp>1370634026124</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:40:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370634039000-63</Id><Title>TRLI: new Christian mobile online media play @ .05......Big names involved.

(NASDAQ: YHOO) recently inked a billion dollar deal to buy Tumblr, which hosts photo-centric blogs. Although the deal hasn't closed yet, Tumblr is already starting to incorporate advertising into its service. That's the “holy grail” onto which Yahoo! is looking to latch.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1370634777445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:52:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370635183206-71</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Taking Off!</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1370634650037</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:50:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A close of $27 or higher looks good.</Msg><Username>tr420</Username><Timestamp>1370635183206</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:59:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370636271845-72</Id><Topic><Title>Tumblr is already incorporating advertising into its service</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1370634777445</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:52:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And it's MOBILE advertising!</Msg><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1370636271845</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 16:17:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370636422201-73</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Taking Off!</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1370634650037</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:50:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's even better when there is no news.

Its a very accurate statement!

You'll fail since that's what you are and all you'll ever be. You'd think you'd catch on that your lying gets you no where considering only your ID's reply to you.

I say wake up spoiled users! Get use to it, ads will be and always has been part of commercial websites. It's how they keep the lights on, pay the bills, bring home a paycheck, pay the mortgage and put food on the table for all the workers. People who demand no ads but enjoy the free service are the same people who will sit at Starbucks ALL DAY, moooch off their electricity to charge up their phone and laptop as they strategically place an empty coffee cup next to them. They also see nothing wrong with hijacking a table and chair from legit customers. These people have entitlement issues - No Ads is not the real reality. The world does not only revolve around YOUR blogging needs or your needs to see dogs on skateboards via YouTube with no ads. Companies cannot exist and will not exist with your "not for profit......what's in it for me mentality." It's just not financially feasible. Soooooo.......I'm all for Yahoo Ads. It will make the shareholders happy.....and pay the bills of the company. ; Ok, enuf of my ranting....just tired of all the whiners......wah wah wah!!!! On another note.....a great close today. I would not be surprise if some news will come out next week.
