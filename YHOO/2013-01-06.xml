This management team will close that gap . . . and, at least, in the short term, the expectation that the gap WILL close will make many bet now while the betting is cheap. On speculation alone the market cap of Yahoo will soon be 1/5 of Google's . . . that puts the stock in the low $40's . . . . the unknown that Alibaba offers will aid in the stock appreciation well before Alibaba does IPO. Way too many favorable speculative factors to not think this gap will narrow and soon.

Networks always have a choice and it could be as simple as scrambling that technology to give errant results. People have a choice as they simply won't buy the TV's with that technology. I love Samsung as they have very ambitious business goals by 2020 and while I don't know how much of a step-up this is from its Widget technology, that is similar, that hasn't taken off that I know of. As an "elective" technology I don't see it going anywhere as people avoid ads like crazy. In the car people change the radio station, on TV they use DVR to record shows and then fast-forward through them and if watching a show online, where the commercials are 1:30-3:00 mins I'll use mute and finish up what is in another browser. I agree with the rest but its almost a Catch-22, hey we'll make money with non-obtrusive ads yet to be effective they almost need to be in your face. I think the best bet is if network TV loses those Dish Network cases in California and NYC(haven't followed lately so don't know if resolved) which would mean commercials would be gone up-ending their business model for the last 60-70yrs. If this is FORCED on the public then yeah it'd be a goldmine but only up to the amount that networks receive currently, it won't be $25-$30B or whatever Google has as people are directly looking for something where as an individual watching tv just wants to WATCH TV in peace.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1357490810538</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 11:46:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357492507143-16</Id><Topic><Title>YHOO's Break Thru Product</Title><Username>argent_a_bend_gules</Username><Timestamp>1357397734038</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 09:55:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More ads on TV is going to be popular?</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1357492507143</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 12:15:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357492674541-17</Id><Topic><Title>It Is All In the Market Cap</Title><Username>hedgingmywayhome</Username><Timestamp>1357486513673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 10:35:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo has demonstrated over the last few quarters that they are not going to disapear. They can't be dismissed as "irrelevent" when they have so many widely used properties. MM's mobile strategy looks perfect to keep them in the game in the coming years. I see their cap going up dramatically at the first signs that her execution is working because then there will be a double play; Alibaba, YH Japan, cash and buybacks PLUS Yhoo revenue growth. The risk reward will be compelling in that scenario. All she has to to staunch the shrinkage and deliver some promising numbers and 30 here we come. So far she has been really effective.</Msg><Username>pithant69</Username><Timestamp>1357492674541</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 12:17:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357492732108-18</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL could pay $32 for YHOO and after using YHOO's cash AAPL would.....</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1357400621726</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 10:43:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bullcrap.</Msg><Username>sjones8924</Username><Timestamp>1357492732108</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 12:18:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357501370642-19</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL could pay $32 for YHOO and after using YHOO's cash AAPL would.....</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1357400621726</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 10:43:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Usual mental masturbation about this subject.
