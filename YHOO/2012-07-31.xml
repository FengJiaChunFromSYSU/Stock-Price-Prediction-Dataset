Yahoo will receive $6.3bn in cash and up to $800m in newly issued Alibaba preferred stock, the companies said in a statement on Sunday night. To finance the deal Alibaba will raise a mix of debt and equity capital. If the new fundraising gives Alibaba a higher value, Yahoo’s payout will be increased. Yahoo will also receive a one-time payment of $550m to settle Alibaba’s use of the Yahoo China name. The deal paves the way for an eventual initial public offering of Alibaba. Yahoo will sell a further 10 per cent stake in the Chinese company as part of any listing, a date for which has not yet been determined. Yahoo will retain its final 10 per cent stake, to be sold at market prices after the IPO following a customary lock-up period.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1343743787442</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 10:09:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343743950642-17</Id><Topic><Title>Ross Levinsohn to resign this week</Title><Username>mb525799</Username><Timestamp>1342533839975</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-17 10:03:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hotmodel is still angry because she didn't buy at $11, $12, $13 and $14 when coldone told her to.
