The spam argument really is not valid, since for any but the small population of the stupid and the naïve it is easily recognizable. Some even waste their time openly exposing spam generated topics targeted, apparently, only to the naïve. Those who suggest Facebook and other similar message boards either discount or are in deception mode of the issue of privacy. When talking about money matters do you really want your true identity exposed? Yahoo message boards are the ONLY currently available source for talking about most all companies linked to their financial information. As far as any interpretation goes of shutting them down it would be to disadvantage small investors in a return to a level of information sharing availability not seen since the 1980’s and the dawn of widespread Internet use. It would be a huge benefit to those who wish to control the widespread availability of financial information. There have been from time to time very lucid posts on what to expect in the investment world on Yahoo message boards. So it would seem that one of the reasons for shutting down Yahoo message boards is to see that such information is no longer available except to insiders. There is also the issue of criminal activity in the financial sector, which gets a lot of exposure by many who post on Yahoo message boards. Could it be that such exposure is unwanted? We wouldn’t want such information to see the light of day, now would we? So just who do those represent that want criminal enterprises to remain untouched, as they currently are in the financial sector? If you think otherwise please DO provide your alternatives (other than Facebook).</Msg><Username>hapiwondrer</Username><Timestamp>1362297621885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 03:00:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362303371172-8</Id><Topic><Title>Who exactly wants Yahoo message boards shut down?</Title><Username>hapiwondrer</Username><Timestamp>1362297621885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 03:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo put a lot of time and money to upgrade the Yahoo message boards if they are now all of a sudden planning to get rid of it!

Only about 500 YAHOO! employees were working from home. The CEO had an audit done which showed "teleworkers" were not logging on at the start of core hours, nor working until the end of their particular work hours. In short, data showed these employees were (1) not putting in a basic core hour work day, (2) there was no way to measure their daily "accomplishments", and (3) accountability was absent. As for this whole dialogue that this is "unfair to women", I'd ask when it became required that women be able to avoid being physically at work, and all that it entails (dressing, commuting, attending meetings, face-to-face communications, etc.). Do females with children need special treatment? Accusations of sexism make popular television and print media. How many of the 500 are "working women" with children at home? If they need to be home, perhaps they need another job with another employer. The rise in the stock price says it all.</Msg><Username>cibor</Username><Timestamp>1362307945122</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 05:52:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362308849063-10</Id><Title>Marissa Mayer: The Future of Yahoo! on Bloomberg</Title><Msg>30 min Interview from Friday, 3/1 reairs on Bloomberg/DISH at 7:30 AM Pacific Time 3/03 if interested.

Lots to ponder. Spam is rampant on the boards. On any given day you have to scroll through many spam posts to get to the 'lucid' posts. On the issue of privacy, well let's just say that even though you post here and believe it is private, in my experience, IT"S NOT. It does work in other venues. Take a platform like Stocktwits...pretty much all there are 'known; to each other. They do post under id's other than their name for the most part, but they do not 'hide' who they are. I'm sure there are many other examples of platforms where do no HAVE to hide who they are for fear of being attacked. You have entirely skipped over the major issue with these boards which is they are being 'conrolled' by very few people using multiple id's. These id's abuse, harass, bully &amp; otherwise make it extremely uncomfortable to legitimately post here. People hide on Yahoo Finance because there is an element of abuse here. When I first viewed these boards, I said there was no way in HELLLL that I would ever post here. Everyone was arguing, accusing each other of being other id's. But, what can I say, I got sucked in., not knowing the 'game' that was at play here. We were in the middle of Yang trying to pull a 'Dell', with Silver Lake, there was a lot going on &amp; I had a new position in YHOO. Fool I was to think that I was talking to like-minded people. Is that a theory you have, that WS wants to close down the Yahoo Finance boards? I don't think it is that sinister, or maybe I don't want to believe it is? Yahoo does need to address the issues with the finance boards. Maybe they do need better moderation. I don't know.</Msg><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1362321885190</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 09:44:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362322174988-15</Id><Topic><Title>Mayer has balls...</Title><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1362269863350</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 19:17:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I doubt it.

Step 1: Yahoo advertiser penalized in SEC action. Step 2: Yahoo records reveal suppression of message board postings against that advertiser (Yahoo facilitates their activities as it were) at this point whether it's automated or discretionary is irrelevant.

It was an interesting exercise to find out who is running this company currently when the prospect of closing down Yahoo message boards was posted because of what you contend is a rumor. It seems like it was Carol Bartz previously, who also was from Wisconsin. According to one source she was also a supporter for the current POTUS. That probably has nothing to do with the reason she was fired as it seems liberal politics are a requirement for entry in the mega-corporate world. It is not a good sign when large corporations like Yahoo place a flaming liberal, like Marissa Mayer, at the helm, but it is no surprise. It seems that this is the direction most large corporations are headed, and have been for a LONG time. That’s why this country’s Founders had great misgivings that their efforts to create an environment of liberty would be lasting, particularly when it comes to corporate power. The one-world agenda, to the detriment of what this country SAYS it stands for will, if left unchecked, result in ever increasing tyranny, not that the American variety of tyrants think it will have any effect on their ability to achieve total control. The Internet and the age of the computer have been hailed as a boon to the ability of the world’s populations to create an environment for liberty to thrive, but there are those who are feverishly attempting to squash it with their liberal drivel meant to deceive enough people to garner support to that end.</Msg><Username>hapiwondrer</Username><Timestamp>1362343009190</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 15:36:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362343872018-64</Id><Topic><Title>Who exactly wants Yahoo message boards shut down?</Title><Username>hapiwondrer</Username><Timestamp>1362297621885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 03:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you so clueless to think Yahoo would spend so much time updating their finance message boards only to shut them down?

I am not exaggerating.” Since it is unknown which message boards you visit, perhaps that is your experience, or maybe just a couple of obvious spam posts sets you off hyperventilating. Here’s a primer for you on how to recognize spam, and to just ignore it. 1. An obvious plug to get you to visit a website which will provide you a way to get rich quick. 2. A bunch of glowing one-liners backing up the glowing claims of success for those who say they visited the cited website. 3. An advisory that your computer has been attacked with a virus, provided you have a good program that can detect it. 4. Many posts stating essentially the same thing about the high quality of the advice and a stream of screen names issuing from the same source and most probably the same persion. Hopefully that will relieve you of your naïveté and get you to calm down every time you detect spam on a message board. Just ignore it. Most everybody else does.</Msg><Username>hapiwondrer</Username><Timestamp>1362354068485</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 18:41:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362354497084-85</Id><Topic><Title>Who exactly wants Yahoo message boards shut down?</Title><Username>hapiwondrer</Username><Timestamp>1362297621885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 03:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL. I know how to recognize spam...thanks for the primer though. : ) Do I really sound like I am hyperventilating. Hardly. I don't let it bother me... I do as I assume others do and ignore the user. Simple enough. All I said was it was visible and there was plenty of it. Maybe you need to relax. Priceless, my 'naïveté'. There are many others who make a far bigger deal about spam on this board. I have to wonder why you have singled me out. Well, no I guess I know why.</Msg><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1362354497084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 18:48:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362354643650-86</Id><Topic><Title>Who exactly wants Yahoo message boards shut down?</Title><Username>hapiwondrer</Username><Timestamp>1362297621885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 03:00:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're full of #$%$.
