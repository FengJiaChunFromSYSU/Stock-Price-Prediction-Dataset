Nice piece - like we thought - very complicated negotiations. This section struck me: "Chernin’s bid, as had been widely reported, started in the $500 million range, which is interesting since the longtime Hollywood executive was once the COO of News Corp. and was critical to Hulu’s creation. Translation: He’d know just what the video platform worth and how the place works." As I said last week Yahoo!'s Mickie Rosen was also an important part of Hulu's creation. Also, I have read that Chernin's bid was 500 million + 330 million towards debt.</Msg><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1369597526620</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 15:45:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369600191716-6</Id><Topic><Title>Reason to not jump into YHOO?</Title><Username>mccormickred</Username><Timestamp>1369569873683</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 08:04:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lardcakes???LOL I challenge you to a powerlifting challenge and a 3 mile timed run.
