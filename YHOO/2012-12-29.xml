The new Spam Policy has caused a flooding of Chines Generated Spam emails, most likely incorporated with Yahoo's Asian Division, soliciting Viagra and Penal enlargement Meds, along with others. Yahoo is being accused of making profit from creating mailing/marketing lists of its core mail clients. Customers are reporting getting as much as 500 Spam mails per day and increasing volume daily. I have read on some of the message boards that many are moving to G-Mail because of the Filtering Policy on Spam Mail from China. Non correction of the loss in patrons is very likely to cost Yahoo advertising income that will effect the current recovering stock price in a stagnant U.S. economy. From the posts I read comers are very irritated and frustrated from the daily increasing nuisance.</Msg><Username>markstevewalker</Username><Timestamp>1356786220000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 08:03:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356791206257-3</Id><Title>The Yellow flags</Title><Msg>What happen to the yellow flags that signaled your stock had a news item?

It's had a good up move and is near the 52-week high. It needs to form a new base around here for it to surge again when first quarter buybacks begin. YHOO has been pretty resilient during the 3 percent market correction. It should trade in a narrow range until this intransigent GOP gets the last nail in its coffin. The petty bickering that the Cantor, Norquist, McConnell Tea Billies are indulging in will hopefully be over Sunday night, and Boehner can regroup the team and negotiate with the President and Reid on meaningful legislation.</Msg><Username>bhttsl</Username><Timestamp>1356806311565</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-29 13:38:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356806692721-15</Id><Topic><Title>My Question....If Alibaba is going public soon and now everyone knows this....then why is the stock not moving???</Title><Username>dickey_betts44</Username><Timestamp>1356676932972</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 01:42:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would they wait for the IPO?? Their growth is supposedly huge right now so now is the time for the IPO. If they wait a year or two there is no telling what could happen. Growth could slow and markets in Asia could turn sour. Right now Asian markets are hot. Why wait? Way too much uncertainty a year or two down the road.

You are assuming the growth rates will remain constant or increase. That is foolish to count on. If growth starts slowing this thing will be worth a lot less. They should IPO now! Not gamble. Markets are hot in Asia now. Who know in two years. Also they will be forced to IPO by then and anything could happen. Better to do it when optimism is high. Don't gamble!
