In a case freighted with major constitutional implications, a federal appeals court on Friday overturned President Obama’s controversial recess appointments from last year, ruling he abused his powers and acted when the Senate was not actually in a recess. The three-judge panel’s ruling is a major blow to Mr. Obama. The judges ruled that the appointments he made to the National Labor Relations Board are illegal, and hence the five-person board did not have a quorum to operate. They said Mr. Obama erred when he said he could claim the power to determine when he could make appointments (Words of a wanna-be dictator) “Allowing the president to define the scope of his own appointments power would eviscerate the Constitution’s separation of powers,” the judges said in their opinion. washingtontimes jan25</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1359455207457</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 05:26:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359459892984-14</Id><Topic><Title>Shoerted AH's @ 21.35!</Title><Username>theearningstrader</Username><Timestamp>1359410363972</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 16:59:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as that was the top,the probability is that "earningsstrader"has problem with the truth. retrospective trading is deluded,stupid and sad!</Msg><Username>accorb1045</Username><Timestamp>1359459892984</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 06:44:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359461849374-15</Id><Title>stores can start surcharging you for credit cards</Title><Msg>starting jan 27.

Yahoo "news" has not uttered a word about it because this pile of trash legislation was ram-rodded through by Democrats signed by Obama. Walmart and Target already announced they will not surcharge credit cards, but other stores will charge without warning.

The stock WAS $21.30 or so AH's last night and now its in the $19's what makes you think you've caught the fallen knife and its bottom? Manipulated? Did you see the same earnings I did? They were mediocre, very little growth, and got their 14%YOY in search cause they jacked the ad prices as overall ads went down. FY 13' revenue will be down $100m-$200M vs. the almost 5B in revenue this year. I thought it'd be better considering they fired 2500 people and bought 6% of the stock which is a penny or two by itself. Operating income fell 22% and next quarter they're going to hand out stock options like candy as it shoots up to $240-$270M from $40-$50M, I think I seen in the last slide.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1359475156065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 10:59:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359475308924-90</Id><Title>Manipulation</Title><Msg>Coldone and MB99, what do you mean about this situation ?

As a matter of fact it paints a rather dismal picture over the next 8-10 trading sessions. We not only made a higher high than yesterday and a lower low than yesterday but we made higher highs than the last 7 trading days and a lower low than the last 7 trading days. In other words, todays' trading range totally engulfs the last seven days. Pull out your chart and take a look at the last several times a trading range has engulfed the previous 3-7 trading days to the downside. The minimum move to the downside after such an occurance has been $1 to as much as $2.50. Several of the past occurances were a very large percentage move even though it was only down $1.50. Why you say could this happen again? Well, anyone that bought it in the last eight days are under water. And those that are long from lower levels are now concerned about the stength at the open and subsequent decline. The buying we have seen over the last several weeks will subside and the sellers will look to take profits in competition with those that bought at higher levels. So although the bull trend is still intact, here comes a correction that will be very swift, similiar to the swiftness of the rally we have seen. A drop below $18 to $17.50-$17.75 could and probably will come by the end of the week or early next. Its just the weak longs getting shook from the tree. But buying at these levels is a grave mistake. Please dont shoot the messanger here. I'm just telling you what I see. Jack Ma, IPO, buyback, and whatever else you want to throw out there is already known by the market. For some reason it gave it all up today. I would not fight it. Wait for lower levels.....I'm sure those in charge of the buyback will!!

Why? 5 CEOs in 5 years. Of course there's been no innovation (what the analysts are banging on). How can a company innovate when a new CEO comes in every year with their own objective and changes the current strategy to a new strategy? Imagine Apple trying to develop new products with 5 different CEOs, in 5 years, with 5 different strategies. Yeah, good luck. As soon as you start to innovate towards a new strategy the new CEO comes in and changes it all up! Engineers aren't going to sign up for that. This is why the Marissa Mayer hire and the new line of board seats is SO important. They are going to bring stability, a single strategy, and good talent for the next several years so that the innovation actually has time to breathe. Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon built their dominance with stability through one CEO (well, Google changed after a long while) a strong board, and smart employees. Yahoo is now positioning themselves for that same opportunity in my opinion. Sure the assets (Alibaba, Yahoo Japan) are great to have but they should just be viewed as a bonus to the core business. If yahoo can get the innovation to start pouring out consistently (think of the mobile Flickr update and the great press it received) then the company is well positioned for the future because it will be a unique situation where you have a growing core business AND assets that are worth billions of dollars.

In my opinion the stock has limited downside. As to the upside, that remains to be seen - it appears limited in the short run unless someone buys them.

During the year ended December 31, 2012, Yahoo! repurchased 126 million shares for $2.2 billion." I watched a bunch of trash talk on CNBC today by idiot analysts (where to they find those idiots). They only take the time to almost know the P/E and don't seem to know the growing value of Yahoo equity in Asia. Hey guys that is money....or can you add the value of two or more types of assets together to define a net value...oh, you mean you forgot about those parts of yahoo holdings. Then I read some of the misleading garbage messages on this MB. It would appear that the objective of all the talking heads and lots of folks attracted to this MB is to obfuscate the reality that Yahoo's net value is growing. Hey growth can occur in lots of ways.....they also seem to completely miss the potential upside if Yahoo gets its core moving (very little of its current price is related to its core...which keeps making money). Finally, we all would like to see relative growth compared with GOOG and FB....but, consider the fact that the whole of the industry is still growing and they still have a strong footprint in a growing industry. If they can articulate an elegant architecture (see the CEOs Bloomberg interview) then they have a huge upside (they have a boat load of patents to protect their investment and partnerships that have value. If they can pull this off then the sky is the limit.... I am buying under 20. My thought is that there are so many talking heads wanting a pull back of the overall market that I will sit on cash until they get the pull back. I expect yahoo to be pulled down with the tide....and I will buy as much as I can!!!!!</Msg><Username>firsttestcase</Username><Timestamp>1359497284546</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:08:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359497828921-230</Id><Title>shares move after hour means nothing</Title><Msg>if you do get a dead cat bounce tomorrow, get out.</Msg><Username>bavaris7</Username><Timestamp>1359497828921</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:17:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359498415521-231</Id><Title>Guy Adami CNBC</Title><Msg>Adami likes YHOO at these levels and feels it could go higher.

Article puts Yahoo into perspective</Title><Msg>By Alexei Oreskovic SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Six months into her tenure, Yahoo Inc Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has arrested the decline of the Internet portal and has won favor on Wall Street with stock buybacks, but a longer-term turnaround remains uncertain. Her promise on Tuesday of a modest revenue uptick in the coming year paled in comparison with the growth of its Internet peers. And Yahoo shares, which have gained roughly 30 percent since Mayer took the reins in July, fell nearly 3 percent to $19.77 on Tuesday. "All in all it seems like they're off of life support," said Michael Binger, a senior portfolio manager at Gradient Investments. But "I still see it as kind of a second tier-search company, a good display company. I still struggle to see the new avenues of growth." Mayer, 37, who was Google Inc's first female engineer, warned investors on Monday that fixing Yahoo was a long-term project. She outlined a plan to overhaul a dozen of Yahoo's top websites, with the goal of enticing users to spend more time on them and consequently boosting ad revenue through a "chain reaction" of growth. For investors already satisfied with the stock's recent gains, waiting for Mayer's chain reaction may not be worth the time and risk. "You can get to $20 with just share purchasing and selling Alibaba stake, basic execution and keeping costs low. Now to drive it further, you've got to fix the properties," said BGC Financial analyst Colin Gillis. "The road gets a little harder," said Gillis. The fact that Yahoo is competing against such dominant Web companies as Google, the world's No. 1 search engine, and social networking giant Facebook Inc, makes the challenge all the more daunting. STREET CRED The product-focused strategy draws on Mayer's strengths in designing some of the most popular online services at her former employer, including Gmail and Google's famously sparse search engine homepage. She is widely admired in Silicon Valley for her Web product savvy, though some analysts and investors have cautioned that she has never before led an entire company as CEO. So far, Mayer has earned high marks in her debut as CEO, with analysts and investors pointing to early accomplishments such as recruiting high-profile executives and boosting morale. "She comes from a culture that has motivated people to be innovators," said Michael Yoshikami, CEO of Destination Wealth Management, which does not own Yahoo shares. He said Mayer's "street credibility" should buy her more time with Wall Street as she strives to turn Yahoo around. "When a new CEO comes in, they have one or two quarters before they have to start showing something. I think she's going to have a year-and-a-half, maybe even two years," said Yoshikami. Roughly 700 million users still visit a Yahoo website every month - putting it in the top ranks globally. But the amount of activity people engage in on many Yahoo sites, such as its email service, is steadily declining and its smartphone offerings are deemed lackluster. By contrast, Facebook has created one of the most popular smartphone apps. Mayer has said her top priority is to create a coherent mobile strategy for Yahoo and that she intends for at least half of the company's technical workforce to be working on mobile products. The company acquired mobile app developers Stamped and OnTheAir during the quarter, but turning development talent into revenue is the challenge she has yet to address. Mayer's handpicked finance chief, Ken Goldman, told investors on Monday to expect profit margin pressure in the first half of the year as Yahoo invests in product engineering and marketing to "lay the foundation" for revenue growth in the second half of the year. And he noted that Yahoo was not through returning capital to shareholders, following the company's $1.5 billion in buybacks in the fourth quarter. That's been good enough for many investors in Mayer's first six months at Yahoo. The next six months may not be so easy. "Every area they go into someone is already doing it, probably better," said Binger, of Gradient Investments.

If not, Microsoft has to make up the difference. The agreed RPS has never been reached since the deal began. This became a big issue last year, when Yahoo got louder about blaming Microsoft for the deal not producing the anticipated revenues (see The Yahoo Search Revenue Disaster). Microsoft is on-the-hook to pay a guaranteed minimum amount. Those guarantees were set to expire on March 31 of 2012, but in October 2011, Yahoo announced that Microsoft had agreed to continue paying guaranteed amounts through March 31 of 2013, for search activity happening in the US and Canada.

Yhoo's balance sheet just got pumped by 35% of 15% of 23B....on a day when it dropped 3% after beating the "A" nalysts' estimates. And Alibaba's growth is off the charts too. So what if it is going to take the lovely Marissa a few quarters to get the growth really rolling. They are still printing money with no debt. And there is enough growth story in the two Asian assets to make yhoo a steal at less than 25.

I hope not as I love Samsung as they're killing it right now but they have no need for Yahoo. A few weeks back, they made over $7B in profit...$7.6B maybe. That is probably very close to what Yahoo has made in the previous DECADE! Samsung has GOALS like becoming a top 5 brand with revenues of $400B. Their going into health, medicine and biotech to do it. Yahoo doesn't have a lot to offer from a financial standpoint. Revenue has stalled with a slight decline forecasted for next year, and its GAAP EPS of .23 was less than last years .24. Search clicks was like 1% growth and display ad's was double digit declines. Operating income fell 22% from 220M+ to 190M. You don't pay a premium on cash and say they liquidate Yahoo Japan and AG you're left with a core that makes less than $900M so a core worth $5B-$10B realistically.
