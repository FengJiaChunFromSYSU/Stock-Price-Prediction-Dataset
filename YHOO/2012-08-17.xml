So far Loeb has kicked and screamed about getting three seats on the board- he can't blame the board from that point forward. He authorized the Alibaba deal to convert shares to cash- he supported that plan. Where is the cash? Is there a deadline or Jack Ma can just "try" to raise $$ into 2013 ? He authorized Yahoo Japan sale, months later what happened, no updates, no one knows. He fired Thompson and used it as an opportunity to assert his power as a shareholder and approved Levinsohn as Interim CEO and less than two months DUMPED Levinsohn and bear hugged Melissa and told the BOD he found the greatest CEO solution for YHOO. Meanwhile stock drifts weakly, no strength, no news worth looking forward to, and now rescind his plan to distribute Alibaba $$ to stockholders and told the pregnant lady to tell the world her first big decision as CEO. Dan Loeb is much worse than advertised. He thumped his chest, now he showed us he is just as clueless in unlocking value in YHOO franchise or the simple breakup of YHOO to unlock value. With all that billions and controlling of YHOO, he is under water on this investment. Dan Loeb and his infactuation for Melissa so far has proved he might not be the right person to manage his investors $$Billions.</Msg><Username>evilwallstreet</Username><Timestamp>1345213082231</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:18:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345213209775-10</Id><Title>Stuck In The Mud in the $14s....Soon $13s!!!</Title><Msg>Sure looks like she is headed back to the $8s-$9s like a few years ago.

Clearly the PR that they are looking for turnaround exec to join the firm is saying Marissa has limited experience and that they again, f'k up in hiring the wrong person so soon, so now they are trying to fill another shoe and pay another $70 million+ to the next guy. Loeb's influence is all over this, I think the man has been listening to the Street and saying, we f'ked up at yahoo so now we need to find another person and pretend that person is COO. Smart man Loeb, try to patch up the mistake.</Msg><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1345230089034</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:01:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345230600031-40</Id><Topic><Title>They should search for CEO so Marissa can be COO...</Title><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1345230089034</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:01:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Loeb needs to FIRE Loeb. Everything he has done in the last 3 months since taking over the BOD is crap. Can't even get cash from Jack Ma- no dead line, no pressure point- just drifting. Same with Yahoo Japan - where is the deal/ WHAT DEAL ? Screwed over Levinsohn royally. Now give Marissa billions to go shopping? Marissa is focusing on the baby first as she should.... and u let her go spend billions? What is the reason for hiring a pregnant engineer to be CEO of a MAJOR tech company? LOEB is WAY WORST THAN YANG thus far.</Msg><Username>evilwallstreet</Username><Timestamp>1345230600031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:10:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345230654067-41</Id><Topic><Title>will close at $15.25 today</Title><Username>yp_ed_merrimack</Username><Timestamp>1345229869878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 14:57:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol. me too.</Msg><Username>yp_ed_merrimack</Username><Timestamp>1345230654067</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:10:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345231966825-42</Id><Title>Almost as if someone is keeping it down</Title><Msg>at 15.</Msg><Username>joco52</Username><Timestamp>1345231966825</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345231991786-43</Id><Title>CNBC just did a story on the gourmet free food at YHOO and GOOG, etc..

No one likes to lose $100 million in a week. And a man like Loeb in his business have months, not years, to make a difference in his portfolio and he has a lot of riding in yahoo.. he is going to make something happen or cut loose, investors can get big bang on so many techs now, so sitting on zero or negative returns on yahoo on his portfolio isn't going to cut it.

It is absurd YHOO is so low with Naz. up so much (over 17%) this year. Is it that the market simply does not trust Jack Ma to come through?? With AG growth (if the numbers are true) Ma should be able to sell more of AG at a $50 bil value (for entire co.) now and close the YHOO deal and even get YHOO an extra bil or two from first 20% and have YHOO's other 20% worth $10 bil. And why can't they get a deal done with Y-Jap? YHOO owns big stakes in these Asian companies yet never has any pull or say.</Msg><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1345238759042</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:25:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345247236816-57</Id><Title>Apple Acquisition</Title><Msg>Palm Beach Letter still thinks Apple will acquire.
