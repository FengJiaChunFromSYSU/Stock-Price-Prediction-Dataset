If YHOO did not grow core and just used its proceeds to buyback stock, they could easily earn over 2 bucks a share. Today, the largest buyback program is HD. Check out that stock. Company has a buyback of around 17%. At present, the 20 in cash out of 26 market cap would be the largest buyback program (~77%). The shares outstanding could go from over a billion to HALF that. This would double EPS at present. Again, thats taking into account ZERO growth. If they can grow 10%, EPS is going to really run...This has potential to be the stock of 2013 and 2014.

Yahoo still owns 24% of it. After paying tax on that stake, it’s worth $13 billion (which is conservative as Yahoo will probably retain 10% of Alibaba post-IPO and let it increase in value). - Yahoo’s 35% stake in Yahoo Japan is worth $10 billion at current prices. After taxes, that’s $6.85 billion. If you think Yahoo core is worth at least as much (although I’d say it deserves a premium to AOL), then Yahoo core is worth 6x its trailing year’s EBITDA (because that’s what the market says AOL is worth). This means Yahoo core is worth $9 billion. - Combined, we have a sum-of-the-parts story that says Yahoo’s worth $29 billion. Currently, it’s trading at $27 billion. There’s probably going to be about 1 billion shares left after they say how many they bought back in Q1. So, the “fair value” for this stock right now is $29… not $24. Add Yahoo's cash to the above and Yahoo's value is well north of $30/share today.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1365867272843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 11:34:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365869149898-14</Id><Topic><Title>Apple and Yahoo In Talks Over Deeper iPhone Partnership</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1365549130283</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 19:12:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A couple of months ago Marissa said that Yahoo was in a place to be friends to everyone. I think this is what she meant. This is classic triangulation, using yahoo's independence to her benefit, playing Google and Apple against each other while she improves and updates yahoo's products. She also said it is all about mobile and her acqui-hires have all been right down that line. The latest, Summly could be really critical because abbreviating top stories for mobile-scrollable sounds really addictive to me. This is a really interesting business story. Nobody walks on water but Marissa appears to be two steps ahead of all the pundits and prognosticators. I think she has a definite strategy but she isn't going to tell Kara Swisher about it.

Partnership Is Apple’s Best Option to Attack Google’s Android</Title><Msg>Yahoo! is said to be talking with Apple about a partnership, according to a report from Bloomberg. Given the mobile-focused strategy that Yahoo!’s CEO, Marissa Mayer, has laid out, the report should not be a surprise. But while closer integration would obviously benefit Yahoo!, Apple would be just as well served. In particular, working closely with Yahoo! would help Apple stymie Google’s Android. But in the end, the biggest winner in any deal would be Yahoo!. Many years ago, Yahoo! competed directly with Google; yet, at some point, the company was passed by. Mayer seems to be poised to bring Yahoo! back to Google’s level, and a deal with Apple would dramatically accelerate that process. For its part, Apple would do well to go along for the time being. Helping Yahoo! compete with Google once more could help slow the growth of Android and keep consumers flocking to Apple’s iDevices.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1365885072712</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 16:31:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365885161097-29</Id><Topic><Title>SHOCK: Something is changing since last week!</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1365555266135</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 20:54:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let us continue this good trend for YHOO.
