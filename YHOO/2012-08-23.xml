The fact that women CEO have not been good at providing solid long term returns for the company. I'm sure there are probably a few that have but can't think of any. And Marissa is no standout, in fact, probably on the opposite end, no experience except in programming. Worst, Yahoo assets are in Asia, and doing business there is usually male domain. Nothing about her hire made any sense which is why it dropped $2 since and even more later on.

It would double their size (revenues and more than double earnings) and give them more credibility as an ongoing company for the long term rather than a potential Myspace that could be gone in 10 years. Plus FB would get a lot of cash (the AG sale and additional 550 mil royalties, plus the Y-Jap sale) and they could go into search big time, (end deal w/ MSFT). And the China exposure and other 20% of AG, patents, sites. Perhaps one share of FB, or a bit more (equiv of $25) and while it dilutes FB by about 50% of their present (now low) market value what they get from YHOO more than makes up for that. That combined company would be worth the $100 bil FB expected and with a bullet. Doubt that will happen and the best is still for MSFT or AAPL to just buy YHOO with their inflated shares.</Msg><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1345735227921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 11:20:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345735778082-23</Id><Topic><Title>Yes, Mayer was a terrible, frivolous hire.
