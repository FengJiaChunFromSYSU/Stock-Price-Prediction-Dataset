The scene of Thursday's bloodshed, the worst police violence since apartheid, was deserted as workers at a hostel of the London-listed Lonmin platinum mine said they would press on with their wage demands. "Expecting us to go back is like an insult. Many of our friends and colleagues are dead, then they expect us to resume work. Never," said worker Zachariah Mbewu, adding that no one would return to work as long as they were still in mourning. "Some are in prison and hospitals. Tomorrow we are going back to the mountain (protest site), not underground, unless management gives us what we want." Fiery former ruling party youth leader Julius Malema fanned workers' anger with a speech on Saturday attacking President Jacob Zuma, whom he wants voted out in the African National Congress's year-end party elections. Zuma must step down "President Zuma decided over the massacre of our people, he must step down," Malema, who was booted out of the ANC in April for fomenting divisions within its ranks, told a crowd.</Msg><Username>boulmichone</Username><Timestamp>1345392494111</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 12:08:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345394619520-2</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa can't speak for herself_ so X-Yahoo Krisnan spoke for her?</Title><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1345299111016</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 10:11:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes bloomberg news yahoo wont let me link</Msg><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1345394619520</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 12:43:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345405198801-3</Id><Title>Is there any realistic chance of a YHOO takeout or merger or....</Title><Msg>...is YHOO doomed to trade between $14 and $16 for the foreseeable future?

Weird, I know, DRIP without the dividend. My experience has been painful to say the least. We should all be thankful that the old board is a thing of the past and that we have Loeb and probably Marissa, too. One thing that does not make sense to me is rebuilding, unless it is tied to a not-too-far-off sale. Loeb does not strike me as the type that wants to wait around the full duration of what it would take to turn around Yahoo. At first blush it doesn't make much sense to hire Marissa, but if MSFT buys them she still keeps her job and has a better one than at GOOG. Also makes sense to hire a pregnant CEO if the sale is imminent. A sale is in the cards, IMO, and that is what the Alibaba non-dividend is about. First, the ship needs to be steered in the right direction. Then, just about time that ship is ready to leave port MSFT or some other buyer steps in. Sale in one year. Two tops.</Msg><Username>doc_ernie1</Username><Timestamp>1345408797542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 16:39:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345410359091-5</Id><Topic><Title>11 Year Yahoo Stockholder</Title><Username>doc_ernie1</Username><Timestamp>1345408797542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 16:39:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And your opinion is relevant because you have 11 years of bad decisions, wrong estimates and a total disregard for the small things like facts, data and reality.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1345410359091</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 17:05:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345411845639-6</Id><Topic><Title>Loeb/Third Point in 2 days down $100 million!</Title><Username>rlclark4</Username><Timestamp>1344981781722</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 18:03:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sure he's nervous but break up on the co. is still above $20 a share.

This company has a brand new but clueless board with great resumes but no idea what is going on because nobody will dare tell them. They have their 4th? 5th? CEO in about as many years. Stock options are worthless so any employeee with real skills has either bailed or has a resume out. The corporate culture is to lie to everyone up the food chain, do nothing and hide until the people you lied to disappear. There is no flow of information. Customer Care is a sink hole; the Board Secy's office is a sink hole; the outside CPA (PricewaterhouseCoopers) doesn't even have a hot line. It is all don't ask - don't tell at the corporate level. I remember, perhaps a year or two year ago, watching the "suits" on a web broadcast about how everything in the pipeline that would make Yahoo a great company. None of it happened and all of that group of "suits" are gone! Certainly, Wall St. doesn't believe a word from anybody related to Yahoo. Or they shouldn't. The driving force has to be Loeb who is responsible to his investors. Right now, Yahoo is dead money. He can deal with this for a few months but but certainly not through his 2013 annual report. He needs to get out at some sort of profit and I'm guessing he knows that a major acquisition will drive the stock down further and keep it down longer. I do not believe that Yahoo can be sold as a whole company. Nobody can run it against the internal corporate culture. I'm guessing that sooner or later, they will start selling parts and then do a restructuring that will take it private, merge it out or otherwise find a way to deal with it.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1345411955011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 17:32:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345421707885-8</Id><Topic><Title>Andrew Shulte, new Chief of Staff at Yahoo!????</Title><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1345415259813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 18:27:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very unfortunate. This will serve to isolate the new CEO even more than former CEO's have been isolated. She will have no idea what is happening at the company; those who get through the "gate" will lie to her as is normal at Yahoo. And then a year from now when Yahoo continues to deteriorate, she will wonder why she was fired.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1345421707885</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 20:15:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345422915015-9</Id><Topic><Title>Andrew Shulte, new Chief of Staff at Yahoo!????</Title><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1345415259813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 18:27:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>managed integrated Google+ marketing campaigns for entertainment and politics brands.....sounds like - letâ€™s give the fool a nonsense title until his employment contract runs out.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1345422915015</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 20:35:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345426522658-10</Id><Topic><Title>PUT YOUR WORST FOOT FORWARD - A COMPANY POLICY</Title><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1345129541862</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:05:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YHOO could be sold as awhole company but the buyer would then sell off parts it does not want or need.</Msg><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1345426522658</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 21:35:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345426730530-11</Id><Title>What I have trouble with is that YHOO is stuck at $15 while since it was offered....</Title><Msg>...$33 by MSFT in 2008, MSFT shares are way up, the market is way up, there are far fewer YHOO shares outstanding now, and Alibaba is worth a lot more, yet YHOO is way down.
