That's right...57!!! You don't see 57 new products from them from each purchase. Key talent and technologies are very rare in tech world which make these buys very necessary to simply remain competitive. Most of the times, they are embedded within products you use everyday. Sure...some may fail, that should also be expected. Mistake do happen and sometime technology simply changes so fast which makes other stuff obsolete. What MM has already done in her first nine months is shift yahoo from being a web centric content company to become a mobile/web technology company. Nine months jojo... Incredbile i think. Personally, I can't wait to see what she and her team will do in the next nine months. Look at it this way...any other CEO in her shoes right now will have already failed and leaving shareholders fuming and searching desperately for the right person. Instead, stock is up 70%!

Previous reports said that Tumblr's board had okayed Yahoo buying Tumblr, so it it's a done deal. People who use Tumblr follow other Tumblrs through a "Dashboard." This works like Twitter or Facebook with other Tumblr blog posts flowing through a timeline. Presumably, Tumblr can start inserting ads between users posts like Twitter inserts sponsored posts. Tumblr has raised $125 million in funding. It's last round of funding reportedly valued the company at $800 million. It was looking for more funding when Yahoo stepped in. Reports on the deal say that Tumblr's 26-year-old CEO David Karp will be able to operate fairly autonomously. Karp will be locked into a four-year deal to stay at Tumblr. That should assuage the fears of any Tumblr users about how things could change (for the worse) under Yahoo.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1368983093636</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 13:04:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368983137174-38</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo will implode to $20 after spending $1.1 billion for POS Tumblr</Title><Username>bounchbranch</Username><Timestamp>1368982908265</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 13:01:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm gonna agree with that - even though you sound like a loser - I seem to like losers.

TUMBLR is the #19th most highly-trafficked website in the US. Not many sites in the top 25 are still independent. Even at $1.1 billion, this is one of the cheapest ways left to buy significant traffic. 2. TUMBLR seems to me the new iteration of Yahoo's shuttered microblogging platform "Meme". YHOO had high hopes for Meme and saw it as a Twitter killer. It also has some tech it can probably make available to improve TUMBLR and bring it to scale. If YHOO can make TUMBLR even half as valuable as Twitter, it's $1.1 billion investment will quickly become a 5 bagger. 3. How much does YHOO's $1.1 billion in cash contribute to earnings? $20 - $22 million per year?I bet TUMBLR will do this in Year 1 and then double that amount every year for several years running. That's Hotmodel's math. TUMBLR will contribute far more to earnings going forward that $1.1 billion in cash. 4. Finally, why is YHOO paying in cash? Some journalists have already speculated it is because of low confidence in YHOO's ability to increase its share price. I wonder if there is another reason. Maybe YHOO and Y Japan or Alibaba have come to terms on a cash-rich spin off for some of YHOO's stake...and they will purchase TUMBLR and spin it off to YHOO tax free.</Msg><Username>argent_a_bend_gules</Username><Timestamp>1368986327155</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 13:58:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368986588375-57</Id><Title>Karp Staying at Yahoo For at Least 4 Years</Title><Msg>1:49 PM More on Yahoo/Tumblr: Kara Swisher reports Tumblr founder/CEO David Karp "will stay at Yahoo for four years at least and retain much control over the service."

It spent a small fortune on the domain me.me to promote it. I thought it was a great platform, but the network effect never kicked in. Now, with TUMBLR, YHOO has the network. Regarding a spin-off, I don't see why it is unlikely. There have been reports in the Chinese press (see below) in just the past few months that Alibaba is considering spinning off Yahoo China to Yahoo. That makes sense to me. I would much rather YHOO get, say, Yahoo China, TumblR, and $2 billion in cash tax free from spinning off another 10% of Alibaba, than get $6 billion in cash taxed at 40%. If I recall correctly, a cash-rich spin-off requires untangling the Boards and other corporate controls between the transacting parties (Alibaba, Yahoo, and maybe Y Japan and Softbank) so they can independently represent the best interests of their shareholders in the transaction. I think some of this "untangling" might have happened when Jack Ma stepped down May 10th. Published 3/20/13 "Time for Alibaba to ditch dead weight" Rumors have been circulating recently that Chinese Internet titan Alibaba Group - which counts Yahoo Inc as one of its major investors and also runs the US-based tech firm's operations in China - is planning to return Yahoo's China unit to its parent company, perhaps as early as May. Alibaba hasn't confirmed any of this yet, but spinning off Yahoo China is a smart play right now for the Chinese tech conglomerate."</Msg><Username>argent_a_bend_gules</Username><Timestamp>1368987876730</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 14:24:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368988243410-64</Id><Topic><Title>why would yahoo get into the laundromat business??</Title><Username>jimibeam99</Username><Timestamp>1368933686009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 23:21:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Strange.....maybe its an old brick and mortar biz that brings consistent$$$.

(which Tumblr cyrrently avoids) begs the question of HOW Yahoo will monetize the Tumblr traffic which reportedly yielded only $12 million last year. In a related post, "argent" suggests that Yahoo could do better than $22 million from an enhanced Tumblr which would required (rough order of magnitude) a doubling of the ad exposure on Tumblr from current levels. Whether that is enough to alienate the user base remains to be seen, but the decline in Facebook's user base since IPO (and actually some time before) suggests that there are limits to what this demographic will tolerate.</Msg><Username>stockscouter9000</Username><Timestamp>1368988361679</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 14:32:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368988409339-66</Id><Topic><Title>TUMBLR Thoughts</Title><Username>argent_a_bend_gules</Username><Timestamp>1368986327155</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 13:58:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How long ago was Meme rolled out?

The cheapest way to buy significant traffic is not buy another company - is to hire talented people who can do what Yahoo apparently can't . 2. YHOO had high hopes for Meme and saw it as a Twitter killer. Again, this means that Yahoo is unable to come up with anything new on its own. 3. TUMBLR will contribute far more to earnings going forward that $1.1 billion in cash? They host spam, porn, and #$%$. 4. Finally, why is YHOO paying in cash? Because Yahoo stock is not worth much.

That's a s***ty bet to make and a lot of assumptions thinking its a winner. Wasn't all last year about how the tech cycles are getting faster and faster? I could swear there were half a dozen articles about how it was 1st search with Google then it was social media with Myspace and Facebook and now we're onto mobile. Half of Twitter? That too baffles me as its a pretty useless website and its revenue shows it. Their click-rate HAS to be horrible(based on my experience of never clicking on any ad). Tumblr hasn't increased in value in 2yrs as its Wiki has it at $800M in 2011 so figure the 1.1B is premium they sure ain't going to flip it. As for that cash-rich split, it hasn't been done in the last 3yrs with Yahoo Japan and Alibaba Group I'm fairly confident that is a term Yahoo will never use. No one is going to help Yahoo avoid taxes and let's not forget they're still being audited by the California tax board and the IRS for the past 4-5yrs of tax returns. I think they ok'd 2 of the years so just the last 3yrs are left to approve. How can there be "low confidence" when Yahoo is one of the top gaining NASDAQ stocks of the year? It's $3B worth of stock buying has bumped the stock significantly. Probably paying all cash so those Tumblr people can leave laughing all the way to the bank whispering "suckers"! What's wrong with paying $2B if their revenue's are $500M and the business model works? I would wager Facebooks decline in users has ramped up since they've bombarded profiles with ads and "suggested posts".(if you find an answer to that let me know). Remember "traffic" means NOTHING if you can't monetize it. Apple has small marketshare in PC's yet makes 40% of all PC profit. Yahoo has had significant traffic and hasn't increased revenue one iota in the last 5yrs.

But I will say that you guys are making me laugh. "cheaper to build than buy" Really? No $hi+. Yahoo or any other company could have pumped millions into a platform that was 10x better than Tumblr but who cares if you can't get users to it? Karp is the visionary and he is part of Yahoo now and MM isn't going to get in his way. On the contrary, she is going to give him access to resources that he never dreamed of to further build out his vision and at the same time be part of the big picture for Yahoo. Tumblr's base isn't going anywhere and they will soon realize that the platform they love is only going to be enhanced by joining Yahoo. Karp is a visionary but he shouldn't be running operations - now he doesn't have to and he can stop worrying about having enough funding to keep his company afloat for another 2 months and can focus on strategy. This is a game changer for Yahoo and it is a huge step to making it a top contender once again. If you think Google, FB, etc. aren't bothered by the fact that MM was able to score Tumblr and a talent like Karp then you are making a huge mistake.

The naysayers have lost the new turn around story of the Decade. Apple was dead, nobody can revive it...AOL was dead nobody can revive it... Yahoo is dead nobody can revive it... Yahoo has the cash and the vibrant energy to make Yahoo play at par with the Big four (FB, AMZN, GOOG, AAPL). I started in December posting when I took a $1K long position in Yhoo, but then on January realized (and posted accordingly) that MM was not running for the bottom (Like I preferred), but sprinting for the TOP. I change my game plan and shoot for options and took bigger bets, I have double my position each and every month since. This is a high stake game as I periodically hedge my position with puts to cover down side, this has been a WILD ride (That is the reason I need hotmodel posting). I still have faith that I will keep riding this baby to $40 in the next 18 months, with the typical ups and downs. Remember this week come out Comscore that could put Yahoo as US #1 site finally (not sure with May sites shut downs). If this happens the media will become berserk with all the attention of YAHOO IS ALIVE!</Msg><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1368999288843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 17:34:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369000153111-133</Id><Topic><Title>MM has started a new "Sprint"</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1368999288843</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 17:34:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok, I'll bite.

If they invest a billion in R&amp;D and 18 months to develop a successful site like Tumblr is today, it will require that the Profit and Loss statement be negative for 6 quarters and still nothing assures them that it will be successful. Do you think Wall Street likes that? On the other hand an acquisition goes outside the PnL and the Business looks positive. That is why she is buying, the buys are an R&amp;D outside the PnL so you do not take a wammy for doing it. Technology Business is tricky and MM knows the rules well.

But the deal will be positive to YHOO so the trend still up up after tomorrow. We need to have more than Tumblr to get us in the $30s. Heard more positive news about Alibaba IPO then I think we will get to $30 quickly. Right now I think shorts are in denial but they know they are toast with this deal. MM knows exactly what she isdoing. This deal will give superb integration due to YHOO's extensive contents. Anytime who have the "cool online users" stay longer navigating the internet, that is Ka-ching to YHOO. Any time you invest your passive money (money in the bank) that will generate good revenue or say improve significantly the bottom line that is positive.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1369009523941</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 20:25:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369010489684-190</Id><Topic><Title>Meyers should have bought Yahoo stock instead of Tumblr</Title><Username>cyrixborg</Username><Timestamp>1368990241427</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:04:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are doing that too!!

And, by the way, the same can be said of Amazon, substituting gross sales for eyeballs, mutatis mutandis. CEOs have come and CEOs have gone. And investors too have learned that value is hard to come by on the world wide web. Most of those early investors are now long gone, having had their pockets picked by the likes of Cuban and Semel, to name two in a long line of exploiters. But you are welcome to dream the dream.

The Wall Street Journal broke the news via Twitter, seemingly confirming rumours of the buyout, which have been floating around for a few days now. Tech pundits had expected Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer to announce the acquisition at a scheduled press briefing tomorrow, but it looks like the cat got let out the bag a little early. According to the Journal’s sources Tumblr will continue operating as an independent company once the acquisition has gone through. It’s believed that the Tumblr buyout is part of a wider strategy to make Yahoo “cool again”. Yahoo! CFO Ken Goldman expressed the sentiment behind this strategy at JP Morgan’s Global Technology conference late last week. “One of our challenges is we have had an aging demographic. Part of it is going to be just visibility again in making ourselves cool, which we got away from for a couple of years.” From that standpoint, a Tumblr acquisition makes sense. The platform is sexy with serious appeal among younger users. From an economic standpoint however, things aren’t quite so clear-cut. After all, as Google alumnus and influential media executive John Saroff notes there are a number of roadblocks standing between Yahoo! buying Tumblr and turning it into a money-spinner. Sure, it could go down the advertising path. There would be tons of advertisers more than happy to get some mileage on some of the more popular Tumblrs out there. But Tumblr CEO David Karp has been vocal in his resistance to using traditional display advertising on the platform. Tumblr’s minimalist aesthetic also means that it isn’t actually suited to traditional ads. Even just a banner and a couple of side ads could completely ruin the aesthetic of the platform’s best sites. Sure there are sponsorship options, but it’s unclear whether those would spin the kind of cash you need to validate a US$1-billion acquisition. Then there’s the fact that some Tumblrs aren’t appropriate, never mind, suited to traditional advertising. Finally there’s the fact that Tumblr doesn’t actually own most of the pageviews on the platform, its bloggers do. That means that if Yahoo wants to put ads on someone’s page, they will have to ask the person who runs the page for permission. Change that policy and it risks alienating the very people who made Tumblr so popular in the first place. One possibility is that Yahoo will have to adapt which side of Tumblr it decides to leverage. Think about the history of blogging for a moment and you’ll realise that WordPress once held the position that Tumblr now does: it was a blogging platform with low barriers to entry. Now though it’s the web’s most popular content management system (CMS), powering websites like CNN, TechCrunch and Wired Magazine. The reason it’s survived is because it’s played on that strength and has continued to evolve to suit those users’ needs. If Yahoo can leverage Tumblr as a serious contender in the CMS game, and spin a couple of side-earners off it, then it might have a realistic chance of turning the platform into something bought for its potential rather than its cool factor.</Msg><Username>warnerlambert</Username><Timestamp>1369016245099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 22:17:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369016348437-231</Id><Topic><Title>LOL @ TUMBLR PURCHASE, NEVER LAUGHED SO HARD</Title><Username>keepshorting</Username><Timestamp>1369016099640</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 22:14:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Longs will laugh all the way to the bank, sport model.</Msg><Username>rlday2010</Username><Timestamp>1369016348437</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 22:19:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369016393293-232</Id><Topic><Title>would warren buffet or charlie munger spend 1.1B on tumbler.

It all depends on what Yahoo does. Will Yahoo start treating Tumblr as a Yahoo site with the customary Yahoo censorship? Driving away a large portion of the users that are there for the relative freedom they enjoy? Or will Yahoo just put their name on the bottom, concentrate on selling ads and getting a decent profit from the investment? It will be some time before anyone knows how this will play out. P.S. If you know how trading bots operate you should be aware that if you don´t see your $40 in the next 5 months you are possibly looking at $16 within a year. It´s built into their metrics calculations and evaluation algorithms and it takes a big event or a manual adjustment to cause a change there. All is not controlled by news, rumors and blind faith. Buy, sell, short and cover. What they said about voting applies to trading; early and often.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1369018073173</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 22:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369018140667-254</Id><Topic><Title>Which shorts are looking forward to tomorrow?
