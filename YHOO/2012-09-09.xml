If necessary, have a separate board just for politics. But get them off these finance boards. Companies like GE have 90% + posts about politics that have nothing to do with the company. One possibility - appoint volunteer monitors for groups of boards who will be trained and then given the authority to police thesel boards and delete non-relevant posts. 2) Take real action against the serial message board spammers who are stealing from Yahoo advertisers and users. Stopping click on URL's is a start but they are still posting using copy-paste. Track them down; stop issuing them ID's; close down their URL's; if, as I suspect, many are non-US, report them to their governments - but get rid of them. Just my opinion.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1347164214181</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 00:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347202005081-2</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba's transaction Value more than AMZN &amp; EBAY</Title><Username>reebok77</Username><Timestamp>1347115499868</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 10:44:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Alibaba Group is growing faster than expevted.

They paid $850 mil for Right Media a few years ago could only get $500 mil now? That's what it looks like. They really should not do any big buying. It still really comes down to YHOO should just sell itself. Its parts are worth a lot more than its whole is now selling for and a new owner could bring that value out and sell what it could not use.</Msg><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1347202177162</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 10:49:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347204622231-4</Id><Topic><Title>China's Alibaba to pass Amazon, eBay in transaction value</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1347078893661</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 00:34:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$473 billion in annual transactions!

Looking at the Alibaba Group purchase without reference to bad acquisitions makes that buy look genius. But all of those billions spent would have been better invested in T-bills. Not to mention all of the dilution to the shares that has occurred over that same time.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1347210039236</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 13:00:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347210129383-9</Id><Topic><Title>How much did YHOO invest for its 35% of YHOO-Jap?
