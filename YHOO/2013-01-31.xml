He does not seem concerned about monetizating his creation, only interested in enhancing the Facebook user experience. However, shareholders like their companies to make money. Facebook would need to compile more robust data on members to entice advertisers. To do that, it would have to require more information in a member's profile that could perhaps border on privacy invasion or scare members already afraid of identity theft. Two years ago Zuckerberg pushed the social network envelope with "Groups," allowing users to put friends in categories without prior approval of the friend. Clicking to dial a local business through Facebook's Bing should further line Local Corps's pockets because it owns the highly specific Enhanced Directory Assistance patents."

If you passed elementary school compression you'll see I was referring to previous buybacks thus the hint of "3-4mos ago""Bartz" and "haven't updated it". I've said all month that Yahoo bought back shares from mid-Oct to November when the volume exploded. I correctly predicted the $1.5B worth of share buyback and as a result I estimate the stock is $2 higher as a result. If the only reason its moving higher, keeping the market cap the same, is buybacks then of course its dead money. As it hangs around $19.70, it is where it was in early December.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1359647773050</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:56:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359648075902-29</Id><Topic><Title>yahoo Japan news... down played.</Title><Username>fpl1971</Username><Timestamp>1359647713297</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 10:55:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"do you wonder why Alibaba and Yahoo Japan ... two quickly appreciating assets are not being factored in at all ? somebody wants your shares.'

See if the market makers on Wall Street make the stock price go down that is only because they want to let their friends accumulate a lot of shares at a very cheap price so that when the buy out comes their friends make even more money. Therefore, the lower the Market Makers can push the stock price the sooner the buyout will be coming.

This indicates that board members are not unified on the direction they want the company to go. Appointing new CEO's get some sizzle and interest, but only cash flow sustains a share price. And, as I read this board, the bulls seem to be arguing broadly among themselves. Divesting non-strategic profitable units is all well and good, but how is that capital going to be deployed? This is a big and complex question, but when I buy Valero or JnJ or Google or Adobe....I get a company that KNOWS where it is going. Yahoo seems to have a rather rich valuation for a company which does not have a committed and tested strategic way forward.

But Yahoo will offer a special dividend, which you will take for voting against a takeover. But you will fool them and vote for it. So you make huge bucks on the take-over and a large dividend as a kicker. $40, $50, $60, maybe even $110 a share. And everyone lives happily ever after. Then you wake from your dream and find out none of that happened, the stock market has set back 15%, the Alibaba IPO has been delayed due to market conditions, and Yahoo Japan business is falling as the Japanese economy slips into recession. Yahoo's core business loses ground to Google and Facebook due to their lack of work in the mobile area and the stock slides back to $15.</Msg><Username>wbobeli</Username><Timestamp>1359668070963</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 16:34:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359668827498-123</Id><Title>The Yahoo Buyout List is Here!

It made $1.17, for the year, which means its PE is 16.7. IDK, what the peers are off-hand as both Google and Apple were low-to-mid teens last I checked. Yes, it has oodles of cash but the return on that money is less than 1% interest and needs to invest it in companies that will grow revenue. The brings us to the next portion "improving fundamentals"...not really as you could look at Q4 2011 and Q4 2012 and not tell the difference. Their revenue shouldn't have been 2% growth for the 2nd year in-a-row when online advertising is growing double digits. Display ads are in trouble down 11%, if I remember right. Operating income fell 22% from $220M to $190M. Here are the positives: They got more search money charging higher prices and their investment income went from $450M, last year, to $676M this year. I'm not aware of a solid strategy nor huge gamechanging products on the horizon. If so tell me as I didn't listen to the conference call. For Yahoo, to go all "momo" you need huge growth its why barely profitable stocks like Amazon, ISRG, and Priceline have gone to the moon. Yahoo also doesn't dominate in anything anymore requiring a leaders premium. Its kind've a weird company in that it won the lottery, has a vault worth of cash but is so scared to lose it that they sit on it instead of improving the vault so to speak even though it has countless tourists visit it everyday. Where is the merchandising and trinket selling?lol</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1359680097674</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 19:54:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359680163644-137</Id><Topic><Title>why does Wall Street hate this company?</Title><Username>gollywogazoo</Username><Timestamp>1359678184248</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 19:23:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ZZZzzzz.....</Msg><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1359680163644</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 19:56:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359680670745-138</Id><Title>Bernanke and the Federal reserve to buy Equities in the open market, above the ask</Title><Msg>Kinda sound like a headline we could get in the next week or so...LOL</Msg><Username>balastona</Username><Timestamp>1359680670745</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 20:04:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359682857844-139</Id><Topic><Title>YJ deal &amp; Alibaba IPO still catalyst to $25+</Title><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1359676391347</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 18:53:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YJ management knows that YHOO got the upper hand if they decided to make a deal with YHOO Ken Goldman. While Alibaba making the announcement that Jack Ma is stepping down as CEO in May this year, again telling the market, IPO is forthcoming and the new CEO will do all the paperworks and IPO roadshows while Ma can concentrate to Alibaba business plans. My take we will see YHOO at $25+ this year.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1359682857844</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 20:40:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359684089745-140</Id><Topic><Title>I am a buyer of yahoo at these prices---Up from here</Title><Username>b.coogan</Username><Timestamp>1359667222384</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 16:20:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would not be so sure. MMs are in control, they sold at high 20's and are bringing it down to a desirable level to buy again.

It doesn't love or hate anything. What you see is the collective opinion of ALL investors everywhere. That opinion suggests,, based on the last four years, a badly managed company, weak product lines, no vision , a board with an inflated value of the company, no potential buyers at an acceptable price, and a questionable future. The "low" valuation is justified.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1359694250193</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 23:50:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
