If every user would generate $10/year profit for buying somethings they need throughout the year, that could really excite the stock. Lots of people think Yahoo enterprise value is close to ZERO in reaching current valuation. Well is Marissa's plan about to reveal something no one had foreseen? Is she going to show MSFT how to build BING and asking for a bigger cut of payment? Is Yahoo front page going to look REALLY SIMPLE like Google"s? Yahoo has been a content aggregator but failed to capitalize on it. How does Marissa integrate the high content front page with simplicity ? $450M in expectation to jump on the plan? I am guessing a short term 20 to 25% jump on this news is a fair return for a quick insider info bet.</Msg><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1348467054877</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 02:10:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348467958597-4</Id><Title>now we know why the volume jumped on friday, but not one single word was mentioned about what their gonna do with the money- what a joke</Title><Msg>what idiots</Msg><Username>delmundosoftball</Username><Timestamp>1348467958597</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 02:25:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348469959366-5</Id><Title>Yahoo is up 2.4% so far in Japan - that translates to 16.11 from the Friday close</Title><Msg>I believe that the steady stream of news which will lead to clear strategies for growing revenues along with gaining the time to achieve the goals by reqarding shareholders with a $3 special dividend will lead to a higher PE followed by either a merger or steady earnings growth.</Msg><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1348469959366</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 02:59:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348476709848-6</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo is up 2.4% so far in Japan - that translates to 16.11 from the Friday close</Title><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1348469959366</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 02:59:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo! is not traded in Japan, Yahoo Japan is not Yahoo.

THANK YOU DEMOCRATS (especially Barney ) for taking us from 13,000 DOW, 3.5 GDP and 4.6% Unemployment...to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! (BTW: Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie -starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy). Barney blocked it and called it a "Chicken Little Philosophy" (and the sky did fall!) And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? OBAMA And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress, especially BARNEY !!!! So when someone tries to blame Bush... REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Bush may have been in the car but the Democrats were in charge of the gas pedal and steering wheel they were driving the economy into the ditch. Budgets do not come from the White House.. They come from Congress and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democratic Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. In that first year, they had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending, when Bush somewhat belatedly got tough on spending increases. For 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budget . And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of these massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. Let's remember what the deficits looked like during that period: If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself . In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is "I inherited a deficit that I voted for, and then I voted to expand that deficit four-fold since January 20th." There is no way this will be widely publicized, unless each of us sends it on!

Let me explain it in a simple way: 1. If assume Yahoo stock will never rise even with massive stock buyback and remains at $16, 80% of floating shares like yours if you have any will be bought back at cheap price, thus Yahoo EPS will rise from $1 to $5 if the profit remains the same. So now people realize that Yahoo is only selling at P/E 3, they would push Yahoo price to at least P/E 10 which would be $50. 2. If you sold your share today at $16, during the process of Yahoo buy back, Yahoo share will for sure rise due to higher demand (if not, refer to 1), you won't earn anything either. So either way, Yahoo price will rise dramatically due to massive buyback. Let me explain this in further, if assume Yahoo spent $15B cash(Yahoo will get $16B cash from selling all of Alibaba and Yahoo Japan) bought back 80% of its float at $16 and all the Yahoo shareholders other than Third Point had been stupid enough selling it at low price. Yahoo would now have only 200M floating shares(20% of current float) left, Yahoo market capital would be $16 * 200M = 3.2B, yet Yahoo still have $3B - $4B cash on book with a EPS $5, P/E 3. Yahoo deservers a price of $50, P/E 10. If there is not enough shareholders stupid enough to sell at low, Yahoo price will rise to a higher level say at least $20... I believe not many people are stupid enough to sell Yahoo now.</Msg><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1348508032619</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 13:33:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348508242958-90</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo should be trading above $20 soon and very soon...</Title><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1348502600894</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 12:03:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ANOTHER Dunce.

In 2010 it went from $8 to $24 in 4 weeks with 50% lower revenues</Title><Msg>Analyst Target: $16 per Upgrade………Take a look at incredible NTWK chart.....3M share float In 2010 NTWK went from $8 to $24 in a few weeks. Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

But,now I feel this stock is ready to move forward,and I'm trying to accumulate it whenever I have funds. Come on people,with all the news about it being,or should be legalized. MJNA is by far the best company in the MMJ industry. We could be on the ground floor of a stock that can make a few of us the next multi-millionaires. Yeah never know.

Started the position over a year ago as well. We'll do fine in the coming months. In addition, commenter above is a huge dbag who will never be able to build a position nearly this large in his lifetime. I'd say good luck to all longs, but we need patience not luck.</Msg><Username>yp_john_san_francisco_323</Username><Timestamp>1348543644775</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 23:27:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348545024305-181</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo's Marissa Mayer to unveil turnaround strategy Tuesday</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1348497677454</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 10:41:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo is going after Google.</Msg><Username>karesh412</Username><Timestamp>1348545024305</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-24 23:50:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
