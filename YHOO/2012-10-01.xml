Daily movements of the stock are being driven mainly by news releases of the company along with the changes that are happening. So the new CEO steps in and says well we may not give shareholders everything that the previous CEO had promised. To be honest I respect that...the CEO needs to evaluate where funds are going to be spent and where the investments are going to be made. I would have been more upset if mgt didn't do anything. She has brought in new blood from Google and has done a lot of things to try and improve employee morale which from my reading she has accomplished. So they are now buying lunch, giving employees smartphones, and plan on throwing a really good holiday party. Again it all falls back to keeping employee morale high and retaining talent. When you think that a headhunter is paid 1/3 of a new hires first year pay its not a bad move. It is painful to watch the stock flounder but present management has to be given some time to get the company moving in the right direction. There are people who trade the stock on a daily basis and some people who believe that a fistful of shorts with a couple thousand shares will move the stock one way or another. What it all comes down to is being able to show the institutional community that the company can grow revenue and increase earnings. If that is accomplished the stock will begin to climb higher...simple as that.</Msg><Username>kenrsmith2003</Username><Timestamp>1349111977406</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:19:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349111987684-121</Id><Topic><Title>Time For a Two Week Vacation!</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1349109330397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 12:35:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Official prison policy is no internet access and no cell phones.

Do you try to understand what your reading when you read? The time you indicate is for the conference call, not earnings release...and the time is Pacific so that is 5pm eastern, a normal time. There is nothing unusual EXCEPT!!! YHOO has not confirmed the earnings release...it is printed for the 15th, the 16th and rumored to be after close on the 12th. If anyone has a firm earnings release time confirmed, let me know. The YHOO web site has not date for special events posted for earnings release as of now...this I find unusual..usually they go with the third Tuesday of the month following the quarter end. I sure can read a lot into an earnings release combined with cash distribution plan released after market close on Fridat the 12th. But who know. I think MM will take a couple hours off from mom duty (GO MM) and make some statement, this is her first quarterly report as responsible CEO.</Msg><Username>goldeagle14</Username><Timestamp>1349120205734</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 15:36:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349120529498-154</Id><Title>Cash Dividend or Buyback?</Title><Msg>Have we definitely seen in writing, or heard, whether there will be a cash dividend or will they put it all in buyback?

The mystery of how that happened right under his nose will never be answered, can't blame Bartz for that. Who would expect that to happen with a founder on the board? One of the other "mysteries" of Yahoo, is how both founders, Yang and Filo, lost their edge, (aside of Yang's investment in Alibba), not contributing anything significant over the last 5 years. I was depressed when I read that Marissa Mayer was "leaning" on Filo for ideas....where's he been buried?!! Google's founders, Apple's founders, all went on to build their companies into greater enterprises. Jerry Yang got into golf, and David Filo obviously likes selling his free options and counting the money.</Msg><Username>cjclink3</Username><Timestamp>1349124293345</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 16:44:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349126303109-163</Id><Title>YHOO should be at $18 to $18.5 right now...</Title><Msg>YHOO should be at $18 to $18.5 right now...lots cash, lots of cash coming in, lots of cash flow, reduced head count, very good vision, new experienced executives, and focus/focus on generating new cash.</Msg><Username>swinebre</Username><Timestamp>1349126303109</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:18:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349127456041-164</Id><Title>I wander when we go to $14 again</Title><Msg>how soon ?</Msg><Username>potencjal</Username><Timestamp>1349127456041</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:37:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349127507279-165</Id><Topic><Title>YHOO should be at $18 to $18.5 right now...</Title><Username>swinebre</Username><Timestamp>1349126303109</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:18:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are used cars out there with more upside than this POS. . .</Msg><Username>uahjunk</Username><Timestamp>1349127507279</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:38:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349127565925-166</Id><Topic><Title>I wander when we go to $14 again</Title><Username>potencjal</Username><Timestamp>1349127456041</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:37:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>15 minutes after they announce earnings this quarter...</Msg><Username>lapetye</Username><Timestamp>1349127565925</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:39:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349129266555-167</Id><Topic><Title>Congratulation to the new parents</Title><Username>fdc17422000</Username><Timestamp>1349113658362</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 13:47:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm just surprised they havent even decided on a name yet.I always thought thought you did that WHILE you're pregnant. although I do know thats a BIG decision for a Yahoo CEO to make</Msg><Username>garybirch55</Username><Timestamp>1349129266555</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 18:07:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349131008448-168</Id><Topic><Title>Frickin Y! email is malfunctioning again</Title><Username>bubblerspring</Username><Timestamp>1349123501336</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 16:31:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Quit whining</Msg><Username>wall_st_knight_mare</Username><Timestamp>1349131008448</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 18:36:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349131508990-169</Id><Title>I think GS leak the Q numbers ?</Title><Msg>$22</Msg><Username>potencjal</Username><Timestamp>1349131508990</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 18:45:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349131802456-170</Id><Title>YHOO will head to 20 - 22.

Cramer said the company's remaining stake in the Chinese Alibaba is worth at least $5.8 billion, while its Yahoo Japan assets can add on another $4.77 billion. Add that total to the $5.84 per share of cash the company has on hand and Yahoo! is already valued at $14.84 a share, leaving its core U.S. businesses, including mail, sports, finance, Flickr and more, valued at just $1 per share. Cramer said that Yahoo!'s core business is worth at least $7.17 a share, taking the total value up to $22 a share. He said with Mayer at the helm, it's easy to think the stock will begin to move once the company reports on Oct. 22 and outlines more of its plans.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1349144694797</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 22:24:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349144884406-186</Id><Topic><Title>Circumcision for the boy?</Title><Username>doc_ernie1</Username><Timestamp>1349138499357</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 20:41:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get off it..
