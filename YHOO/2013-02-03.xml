A medical company is blaming President Obama’s health care law for the layoffs of nearly 100 people.

Microsoft's Bing does not get user information from Yahoo; Bing only gets the query from Yahoo not the user information. Yahoo keeps that information and is not allowed to give it to Microsoft (privacy issues). Microsoft has never had access to that information and their search engine has not shriveled up and died. The DOJ prevented Yahoo from doing a small ad sales deal with Google in 2008. Google will have great trouble doing any deal with Yahoo as long as there are antitrust laws. Microsoft cannot give up their online services division. The Microsoft online services division is responsible for all Windows upgrades and customer support. Bing is just a small part of Microsoft online services. Apple will not buy Yahoo without search and Apple can only buy Yahoo without search. Yahoo has nothing Apple needs, nothing Microsoft wants and nothing Google can get.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1359910353504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 11:52:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359910446866-24</Id><Topic><Title>Buy or sell Yahoo at $20?</Title><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1359850866042</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 19:21:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm a buyer at $20.

Billy check him out and you will be amazed. On Yahoo Monday closes at $19.47, Tuesdat closes at $1945, Wednesday $19.56 and Thursday $20.12 and Friday. $20.23. He will be 87% right.

But can she partner with all of these companies simultaneously? Almost certainly not. There will come a time where Mayer has to bet on one of these horses, in a big way. When she does, she will have to ride that horse -- unless, of course, one of the spurned companies comes back and tries to buy Yahoo to keep it from the clutches of a competitor. We're coming up to a key decision point, at the end of March, when Mayer will decide Yahoo's future in search. There is no question, that Yahoo could make more money from search by teaming with Google. I think there's also a good line of reasoning to argue to the Justice Department that a partnership doesn't run afoul of antitrust concerns.</Msg><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1359917611045</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 13:53:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359917715504-45</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft has the most to lose by not buying Yahoo</Title><Username>tornupdown</Username><Timestamp>1359908053723</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 11:14:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another permutation might have been revealed through Tuesday's Facebook-Microsoft announcement.

(SASSA) is "Algorithmic Search Services." This is what Microsoft has agreed to provide to Yahoo and what Yahoo has agreed to exclusively accept from Microsoft. So what are Algorithmic Search Services? To discover that you have to go to Appendix A, Section 16 of the SASSA. "Algorithmic Search Services" means Internet Search services that (a) utilize general indices of a reasonably comprehensive portion of the World Wide Web for (i) Web pages; (ii) images, and (iii) video; and (b) are accessed by users via Queries. Algorithmic Search Services excludes, without limitation, Yahoo! Excluded Services, Microsoft Excluded Services and search services via a search engine that has indexed predominantly a specific topic, or that search closed databases or data feeds, or content located only within a domain or portion thereof." Read that final bit again. The deal does not include "search services via a search engine that has indexed predominantly a specific topic, or that search closed databases or data feeds, or content located only within a domain or portion thereof." In other words, if Yahoo and Facebook were working on a search engine that was confined to information on Facebook, it would fall outside of the SASSA. The kind of search Zuckerberg wants — "Which of my friends or friends of friends work in a company I might like to work at?" — is most likely not included in the SASSA because it would be a search of a closed database, the Facebook database. In short, there's no need for Yahoo to break its deal with Microsoft in order to forge a new search deal with Facebook. Yahoo can probably have deals with both Microsoft and Facebook.

The remaining stake is now 62 million shares, which means Third Point is no longer the firm's largest institutional holder with a 6.17% stake, but drops to 4th place behind Capital Group and above Vanguard, who own 67 and 48.9 million shares respectively. The reason given for these opportunistic sales is that they were "motivated by Third Point`s desire to maintain a roughly consistent percentage holding of Yahoo`s outstanding shares as the company pursues its $5 billion buy-back authorization." Of course considering the $1.5 billion in shares that YHOO has actually bought back represent some 6.5% of the outstanding, one is a little confused how a 15% stake reduction is hedged relative to an actual buyback that is some 60% smaller. Does this mean another 15% stake cut in Q1 when YHOO, supposedly, buys back another $1.5 billion?</Msg><Username>wbobeli</Username><Timestamp>1359926025952</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 16:13:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359928071598-55</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa Mayer And Sheryl Sandberg Are In Secret Talks To Make A Facebook/Yahoo Search Engine</Title><Username>tornupdown</Username><Timestamp>1357835548638</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 11:32:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All of your sources comments have not come to fruitation...I'm long but stop giving info that doesn't happen.
