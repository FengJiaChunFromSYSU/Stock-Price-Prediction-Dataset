By TIERNAN RAY Hope is growing among investors that Yahoo!'s new CEO can turn the company around. Like many victims of early success, Yahoo! has for years been in search of what it wants to be. There seems to be an excellent chance that CEO Marissa Mayer, appointed in July, can satisfy investors by restoring at least a little hope that Yahoo! (ticker: YHOO) can be a real contender in the new world of the mobile Internet. The stock's valuation isn't overly demanding, and a bright team with fresh views on the matter may at least stem the tide of decline in recent years, which would be enough to encourage numerous investors. Beyond that, however, looms a much larger question. At Friday's close of $17.26, the stock is up 20% from its 52-week low. Yahoo! over the years has lost what little identity and urgency as a tech company it had at the outset, and it isn't clear Mayer, for all her skill and experience, can give it that. If she can't, then the stock's recent gains will be a short trip to nowhere. We old-timers can recall encountering Yahoo! in the early '90s. It was a simple site with a nicely organized collection of hyperlinks that people could check out as they got used to this thing called the World Wide Web, something like a table of contents. The mission was never auspicious. The founding credo, if we recall correctly, was "Yahoo: A more efficient way to waste your time." Founders Jerry Yang and David Filo won the venture-capital lottery and went public, along with a gaggle of Web hopefuls such as Infoseek and Excite and Lycos, who've all gone by the wayside. There followed a period of many years wandering through various transformations, during which Yahoo's revenue was growing by double-digits as users of the Web expanded at an astronomical rate. Yahoo! used its stock as currency to make a number of acquisitions, transforming itself into an odd amalgam of content and sociability without any particular identity as a technology company. Yahoo's founders retreated from the scene as a parade of professional managers came and went. Mayer, who sources tell me is greatly respected in Silicon Valley, has a sort of Obama moment, if you willâ€”in the '08 sense, not the '12 sense. Having taken a rather bad hand, she enjoys tremendous good will in her effort to restore hope to Yahoo! and engender change. Mayer, who ran the search business at Google (GOOG) for many years, has brought in former colleagues in key positions at Yahoo. There is a sense not only that she brings technical acumen, but also that she has a deep understanding of the grand challenge facing every Internet company: namely, the fact that increasing use of mobile phones and tablets curtails the ability to easily monetize content through advertising. When people aren't sitting in front of a computer, getting them to click is increasingly difficult. MAYER'S ARRIVAL ON THE SCENE has a subtext, in that Valley types would very much like to see a really successful female tech CEO. Mayer's predecessor, Carol Bartz, who ran software maker Autodesk very well for several years, was shown the door at Yahoo! last year by the board of directors in a most unceremonious fashion. Yahoo's challenge, says Paul Saffo, a long-time Valley observer, is that it has never been particularly strong technologically. "They lost the battle for engineering talent early on" to Google and others, says Saffo. Not to mention the company has seen tremendous attrition in the years preceding Mayer's arrival. Yahoo! never put a mission in place to organize search as Google did, through sophisticated algorithms that leveraged the input of millions of Web surfers. Nor did it come up with a slick system to have advertisers set the price for ads through auctions, as did Google. Results have been dismal for years, and may be merely less bad this year, with revenue projected to slip 0.5% to $4.45 billion, after a 21% decline last year. Google's recent gains in display advertising, through properties such as YouTube, have doubtless come at the expense of Yahoo!, long the display ad titan. Where Google's third-quarter display-ad revenue may have risen by 50%, year over year, to $1.5 billion, according to analysts, Yahoo! saw its display revenue stay flat at $452 million. And now the company has seen the revolution in personal publishing carried away by the likes of Facebook, which is increasingly where many people spend significant time, or engagement, in advertising terms. Twitter is increasingly where we turn for news, in a grass-roots fashion, as was shown most spectacularly during last week's presidential election. But, as Saffo reminds us, Yahoo! has many prized properties buried within its heaps of content, such as Yahoo! Finance and the Yahoo! Groups discussion boards. "I use Yahoo! Groups way more than I use Google Groups," remarks Saffo. There ought to be a way to excavate some of those assets and monetize them better, in order to return Yahoo! to growth. Moreover, Mayer presides at a time when everyone, including Google and Facebook, is trying to figure out how to deal with the shift to mobile. Such periods of epic change can be a good time to tear things up and make bold innovations. The stock's valuation is close to a market multiple. It fetches 15.4 times this year's projected earnings of $1.12 per share; the estimate is the same for next year. When backing out about $6 per share in cash and investments, the stock fetches a more modest 10 times. That's leaving aside the $2.8 billion it's invested in Chinese e-commerce venture Alibaba Group Holdings and Yahoo! Japan, a partnership with Japanese investment firm Softbank. Those entities' fair market value is worth billions more. What should worry you is not the valuation, but the prospect that Mayer may not be bold enough. During the third-quarter conference call last month, her first as CEO, Mayer told Wall Street, "I don't think this is a situation where there's a giant pivot and we go into a completely different business." Let's hope she's playing possum. For this is, indeed, a pivot point, an inflection, a paradigm shift, or whatever jargon you prefer. A company that never had a technological mission desperately needs to claim its identity. As powerful data centers churn out incredible computing power and analyze every single move a Web user makes on every fast new gizmo in their hands, it's time to be aggressive, Ms. Mayer.</Msg><Username>crabcakes888</Username><Timestamp>1352648984306</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 10:49:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352653312441-8</Id><Title>You should have listened to coldone</Title><Msg>When coldone gave the good advice to buy Yahoo at $11, $12, $13, $14, $15 and $16, you should have listened.

The writer misses three points: First, these boards have already been monetized by a well-organized group of third world serial spammers whose posts are designed to steal from paying advertisers and users and who are enabled by existing Yahoo employees. Second, I'm guessing that at least half and probably more posts are political and have nothing to do with stocks or the stock market (see GE, for example). Finally, many boards have their own equivalent of Coldone, a time-waster with multiple ID's who fills up space with unsupported, useless posts. So for Yahoo to monetize these boards, it needs to bring in an outsider with a new level of ethics and the understanding that simply eliminating posts with certain four letter words is not the answer to cleaning up, improving and ultimately monetizing these boards for Yahoo. Just my opinion.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1352666323583</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 15:38:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352666530128-12</Id><Topic><Title>What is Marissa Mayer's Top Secret Pet Project at Yahoo?</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1348114590837</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 00:16:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This will kick off the beginning of many changes at Yahoo.</Msg><Username>ashton10shyof</Username><Timestamp>1352666530128</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 15:42:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352666854899-13</Id><Title>Marissa Hates Fantasy Football</Title><Msg>They can't even get this right.
