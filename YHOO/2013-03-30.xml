Why is zuckerburg starting a lobbyist organization? To push just that, online gambling and other reasons of course I'm sure. FB Is going to make some huge moves. Facebook partnering with Android.

She's cleaned out the executive suite, put in her own people, and made a few acquisitions. In the last earnings, they forecasted DOWN in revenue for the year as well as an exponential increase in stock options they'll be handing out. As for the stock rise, its part FAITH in her getting these results that she hasn't gotten yet and the fact they are buying back shares in droves to make a dent to shares outstanding. Add in the fact the Yahoo Japan stake has gone up $2.5B and whatever the AG IPO adds you'll see she didn't do a whole lot. Ballpark: $2.50 gain to share price- from Yahoo reducing share count 10% $2.00 gain- from Yahoo Japan increasing in value $2.00 gain- Increasing likelihood of IPO and additional reduction of shares from the billions gained when sold $1.00 gain- Faith in Marissa Mayer turning the company around $1.00 gain- Bandwagon jumpers who've seen the stock head north technically so hopped on $500.00 gain- cause she got rid of those pesky tele-commuters even though its the future of the job market.lol</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1364668834300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 14:40:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364668856665-29</Id><Topic><Title>prediction.</Title><Username>jamesfkennedy50</Username><Timestamp>1364655542227</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 10:59:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But not my comment regarding znga?

In an ESPN article, they had Goodell tell owners he thinks revenue will be $25B in the next decade, 150% gain. Billion dollar franchises will be $2-$3B. Its really 25yrs to get the 7 game package? Time to build super Lambeau with seating on par with Michigans 110K seating for football. On a quick side note, when Tubby got fired someone on ESPN posted a link to Nebraskas basketball team athletics and no way can the Gophers compete. We're talking 104 FEET of TV's, a leather lounge with pool table, a wall of TV's, counter, fridge, a new 15,000 person arena in Lincoln, and half a billion in construction. Oh and I do suggest looking up the locker room as it puts NBA teams even to shame. Add in the fact, Detroit spent $180M+ on Verlander it looks like its going to be a LONG year for Minnesota sports. Twins won't win 70 games with their non-existent pitching and all the other teams SPENT money while we cut. Football should be interesting but Ponder is going to have to really improve, San Fran and Seattle are the teams to beat IMO. Maybe, the Wild will win the Cup so I can forget the other 6mos:)lol BTW.

Condolences are an expression of sympathy to someone who is experiencing pain arising from death, deep mental anguish, or misfortune. When individuals condole, or offer their condolences to a particular situation or person, they are offering active, conscious support of that person or activity. This is often expressed by saying, "Sorry." Often, the English language expression "My condolences" will be in a context, such as death of a friend's loved one, in which the one offering condolences is communicating a feeling of pity towards the unfortunate party. Expressions of condolence may also used as sarcasm if one considers the complaining person to be exaggerating their suffering, especially when they appear to consider as tragic something that is relatively insignificant. There are various ways of expressing condolences to the victims. Examples include donating money to the charity nominated by the person who has just died, writing in a condolences book or supporting the friends and family of the loved one by making meals and looking after them in various ways in times of need.</Msg><Username>w0065jane</Username><Timestamp>1364672887052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 15:48:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364673064687-40</Id><Topic><Title>I didn't even know Phil Ramone was sick</Title><Username>w0065jane</Username><Timestamp>1364672887052</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 15:48:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one tells me when people are sick.
