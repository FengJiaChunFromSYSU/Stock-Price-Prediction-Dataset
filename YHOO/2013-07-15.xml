After all, there are still real threats from Google (GOOG_) and Facebook (FB_) that the company is working to mitigate. What is clear, though, is that Yahoo! is no longer the pushover that it once was. Here too, Mayer has had a huge in changing the company's image. And with a few more improvements in some key areas, these shares still look undervalued on a long-term basis. To that end, it doesn't work to judge Yahoo! on metrics that may or may not presently matter. It's best to take full assessment of the company's new direction as a "true" technology company and not one that is solely focused on media -- as its recent history would suggest. Accordingly, I still see 20% of unrealized value in this stock on the basis of improved free-cash-flow growth and revenue growth.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1373906401619</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:40:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373906697560-42</Id><Topic><Title>Buy Yahoo!

(YHOO) with a Buy rating and a $36 price target, saying he likes the company’s chances of returning to growth for a number of reasons, including the fact the “campus radiates a feeling of enthusiasm,” based on his visits. Sanderson thinks CEO Marissa Mayer is early in the process of turning things around, having gotten people “into the right roles,” gotten “the right plans in place,” and having “reinvigorated the culture,” he argues. The next stages include “get the right products into market” and try to return to “growth at rate of market” or even “grow faster than the market.” If she can meet the market’s growth rate, perhaps 10% annual revenue growth by 2016, for example, the stock could be worth $44 by that time, he thinks. If Mayer can grow revenue by 14% by 2016, Yahoo! could be a $50 stock by that time, he opines.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1373912257157</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:17:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373912751342-54</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo!: MKM Starts at Buy on ‘Core’ Turnaround, $36 Target</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1373912257157</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:17:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's kind of refreshing to see an analyst emphasize core yahoo as opposed to their Asian investments.

There is energy and excitement that seems to have been lacking for a very long time. Enthusiasm and optimism among employees does not ensure a turnaround, but a turnaround in a fast-moving, competitive industry is impossible without a revitalized culture […] Despite its downturn, YHOO has retained a very large base of users. Audience has been surprisingly resilient in YHOO’s core verticals. The problem is that engagement is significantly lower than other top online media properties. We think YHOO has a fairly low bar in improving the quality of its products and experiences […] During Carol Bartz’s tenure as CEO the company did a complete platform overhaul, standardizing and modernizing its technology infrastructure. A foundation rebuild is not glamorous work and does not directly lead to revenue growth (hence Bartz’s departure). But we think YHOO would have no chance for a product-driven turnaround in today’s competitive environment without this work. This is important […] YHOO is now releasing new products/ product updates on a weekly basis. There is more of a mobile skew as the company was behind in this area of fastest growth […] There are several synergies between YHOO and Tumblr. Most obvious is that Tumblr is a meaningful traffic driver with heavy engagement and little/ no monetization. Tumblr traffic adds 20% to global YHOO, which is massive considering YHOO is one of the top-three global Internet properties.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1373913801635</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:43:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373913833994-59</Id><Title>Is YHOO the real deal?</Title><Msg>Has someone taken a look at the articles being published?

Japan and Alibaba are exciting properties with upside potential, but we like YHOO for turnaround potential in the core business. There is certainly value-creation potential in the Asian assets, but they could also decline in value. We would like to see management continue to decrease its Asian asset exposure via more divestitures along with share buy-backs (some of this is guaranteed on the Alibaba IPO). We think greater exposure to a turnaround at core YHOO is better for investors than a gigantic balance sheet and value in investments. Removing the tax-effected value of Asian assets and the company’s net cash position implies that core Yahoo! trades at only about $5.50 per share. This assumes that Alibaba is valued at $75B (including the IPO stake and the remaining stake). Using consensus EBITDA estimates, core YHOO would be trading around 3.5x EBITDA. If Alibaba is $100B as many speculate, this implies core YHOO is trading close to $2 per share and around 1.5x EBITDA.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1373918909564</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 16:08:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373919164457-71</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo!: MKM Starts at Buy on ‘Core’ Turnaround, $36 Target</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1373912257157</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 14:17:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LMAO When do you EVER stop lying???

We've risen almost $2.50 from $25, in a straight shot hitting against the $27.50 resistance. It's also had trouble over $27 this past week so I think the odds are in my favor.
