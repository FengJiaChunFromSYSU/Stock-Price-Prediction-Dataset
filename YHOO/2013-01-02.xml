It extended tax breaks on Hollywood through 2013 whle raising payroll taxes on ordinary Americans.' Yahoo news ignores the issue completely. No mention at all that Obama raided taxes of working Americans but gave rich Hollywood a tax break. More.... (Breitbart) – The Senate passed legislation meant to end the “fiscal cliff” crisis in the wee hours of the morning. And it seems Hollywood’s rigorous backing of President Barack Obama and his Democrat peers in the waning months of 2012 paid off. Section 317 of the freshly approved legislation includes an extension for “special expensing rules for certain film and television productions.” Congress first enacted production tax incentives favorable to the domestic entertainment industry in 2004, and extended them in 2008, but the deal was meant to expire in 2011. SPECIAL: Bypass the Lame Stream Media! Expose The Truth About ‘America’s Fraud President’ to UNLIMITED Households! The fiscal cliff deal extends the tax incentives through 2013–even as payroll taxes rise on ordinary Americans. The original tax incentive applied to productions costing less than $15 million to make ($20 million in low-income areas). The 2008 extension applies to all films, up to a deduction of $15 million (or $20 million in low-income areas). The incentive is especially generous to television series; it applies to each TV episode. Hollywood players routinely beg the government to raise their taxes so they can pay their “fair share.” Yet the industry moves new productions to places where existing tax breaks help its bottom line. That means plenty of shows and films are shot in states like New Mexico, which feature highly favorable tax rates, as well as destinations north of the border with similar perks. Now Hollywood has used its clout to ensure that its generous tax incentives will continue in a time of fiscal crisis.</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1357123689652</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 05:48:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357127030939-7</Id><Topic><Title>Found The Answer!</Title><Username>aminamincy796</Username><Timestamp>1308240766000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-06-16 12:12:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fantastic.

This means that Yahoo!'s core offerings (Display, Search and Other) are valued at approximately 1.2x LTM EBITDA and 1.1x 2013E EBITDA on a pre-tax basis. Some folks look at Yahoo! on an after-tax basis, assuming a zero cost basis in its Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes, taxing the sale of these entities at 37% (roughly the tax rate on recent Alibaba sale gains). This analysis yields Yahoo!'s "core" business trading at 4.2x and 3.9x LTM and 2013E EBITDA, respectively … Still at a discount to comps. For simplicity's standpoint, let's look on a pre-tax basis as (1) we don't know when these assets will get monetized, which could be in a few years meaning the market values of these investments could be substantially larger than currently as they are both growing at a rapid pace; and (2) when comparing price to book value, both are on a pre-tax basis. If we assume some sort of multiple expansion to reach the realm of AOL's EBITDA valuation (4-5x EBITDA), then Yahoo! looks more like a $25/share stock.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1357145679570</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 11:54:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357146439383-55</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone's Advice to Buy Yahoo From $11 to $19 Was Perfect</Title><Username>bflathalfdim</Username><Timestamp>1357139956520</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 10:19:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I remeber hotmodel and framer telling coldone he was all wrong for buying Yahoo at $11 to $19.

If you followed you own advice and sold yahoo on the 31st, how does it feel now that yahoo pushed past $20 today?

A day after the House of Representatives passed a deal to avert the fiscal cliff of tax increases and spending cuts, Moody's said it expects fiscal debates "in coming months" to result in lower future budget deficits. Lower deficits are necessary "if the negative outlook on the government's bond rating is to be returned to stable," Moody's said. Moody's said it believes that the U.S. debt limit will ultimately be raised but said the outcome of negotiations is uncertain.</Msg><Username>edya_gupta</Username><Timestamp>1357158674417</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 15:31:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357159641364-75</Id><Topic><Title>Feel Sorry For Hotmodel</Title><Username>ashton10shyof</Username><Timestamp>1357156414609</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:53:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>…She spent years on this board bashing Yahoo and fighting with coldone...and yet the coldone groupies claim he has only been here a few months.

Look at how much you try to talk to me? At least half a dozen topics have 60-70-80 posts in them with 95% written by YOU or your ALIASES! I'm not even in those topics cause frankly you're a junior high very feminine male who adds ZERO SUBSTANCE. The psycho mentally unstable obsession will be studied at loony bins as a case study for generations to come. If you had an ounce of testosterone being a normal male liking sports and hunting you'd certainly be another Adam Lanza! Fortunately for us you like girly tea parties with your imaginary friends(your other ID's) enjoying phantom success over phantom shares which must be 1-1.1B of all shares outstanding by now.

I've stated I think NFLX could be a monster win with a $120 target, have LEAPS. I haven't conquered time travel and if you know what writing puts means which makes me a synthetic long, I did very well...sorry you're jealous.

I also gave it a VERY VERY Santa generous valuation on the AG stake left showing the core isn't worth $15 per share in the hypesters wildest dreams and that is still higher than today.
