The amount represents a huge return for Yahoo's $1 billion investment, led by co-founder Jerry Yang, in the then-fledgling Alibaba seven years ago. The payoff will give the company and its new CEO, Marissa Mayer, as much as $4.5 billion after taxes to use in helping revive Yahoo, which has been struggling to compete in Internet growth.</Msg><Username>opengslide</Username><Timestamp>1347894100135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:01:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347894473419-28</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo to get billions from Alibaba sale Wednesday</Title><Username>opengslide</Username><Timestamp>1347894100135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:01:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where in the article does it say Wednesday?</Msg><Username>jpalopoli</Username><Timestamp>1347894473419</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:07:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347894763287-29</Id><Topic><Title>message board issues</Title><Username>goldenseth</Username><Timestamp>1347893158243</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 10:45:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So..are you soliciting feedback from here (via this message board) or from the feedback toolbar at the bottom of the page?</Msg><Username>rlp2451</Username><Timestamp>1347894763287</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:12:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347895024802-30</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo to get billions from Alibaba sale Wednesday</Title><Username>opengslide</Username><Timestamp>1347894100135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:01:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you blind?</Msg><Username>opengslide</Username><Timestamp>1347895024802</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:17:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347895256689-31</Id><Topic><Title>message board issues</Title><Username>goldenseth</Username><Timestamp>1347893158243</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 10:45:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From the message board and not the tool bar, kindly.</Msg><Username>goldenseth</Username><Timestamp>1347895256689</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:20:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347895296508-32</Id><Topic><Title>message board issues</Title><Username>goldenseth</Username><Timestamp>1347893158243</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 10:45:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's just solicitating.

The following by Kara Swisher in All Things Digital was posted last week &amp; has been roundly discussed &amp; referenced in said discussions: Exclusive: Mayer Set to Get Yahoo’s Alibaba Billions in One Week (But Will Investors Get Some Back, Too?) SEPTEMBER 11, 2012 AT 9:01 PM PT According to sources close to the situation, Yahoo will officially close the multi-billion-dollar sale of half its assets in China’s Alibaba Group in one week. Sources said the deal is set to be announced next Wednesday, in which the Chinese Internet giant will pay the Silicon Valley company $7.6 billion to buy back 20 percent of Alibaba. Yahoo still owns another 20 percent. Yahoo will get $7.1 billion in the transaction, as well as a $550 million payment related to the ending of licensing fees that Alibaba has paid annually to Yahoo. It’s a huge return from when Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang led a $1 billion investment in the then-fledgling Alibaba seven years ago, with a belief in its CEO and co-founder Jack Ma. But once-cordial relations between the companies became tense in the ensuing years, as Ma sought to lessen Yahoo’s 40 percent ownership. After many public kerfuffles, Yahoo finally agreed earlier this year to sell half its stake. It still holds 20 percent, which could eventually reap even larger returns once the fast-growing Alibaba goes public in several years. Yahoo is required to sell 10 percent at that IPO and must sell the rest after that. Still, Yahoo is getting a pile of money now. After taxes, that gives new CEO Marissa Mayer about $4.5 billion to use in some as yet undetermined way. But it will most likely be for a series of acquisitions to try to reinvigorate the long-troubled company. Yahoo’s board and later its CFO Tim Morse had promised to return the money to shareholders by way of a stock buyback. But, last month — in a move that quickly depressed Yahoo’s shares and angered major investors — the company filed a statement saying that Mayer was reevaluating that move and could keep the money for other strategic reasons. Given what a huge windfall it is getting, it will be interesting to see if the board of Yahoo — which is meeting next week, sources said — will choose to return a portion of the Alibaba money to shareholders. A recent similar move by AOL — using money it got from selling patents — was partially the reason for the recent run-up in its stock. Yahoo could also presumably also give a special dividend to shareholders, but that is less likely. That will be the question once Yahoo gets its cash in the kitty, which is no small feat. The complicated transaction spans the globe, given the size of the borrowing — $8 billion, which will value Alibaba at $43 billion — that the company is doing to regain some control from Yahoo. The deal includes debt, as well as the sale of both convertible preferred and common shares, and includes a wide range of players. That includes current investors, such as Silver Lake, DST Global and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings, as well as many others. “This is a lot of money flying around the world to complete this,” said one person close to the situation. Speaking of more money, it’s still unclear where Yahoo is in its long and very drawn out negotiations with its other Asian partner, SoftBank, over selling its stake in Yahoo! Japan. Sources said the deal was proceeding well right before Mayer was hired, but that she slowed down the talks to reevaluate the prices being discussed. Since then, shares in Yahoo! Japan have appreciated strongly, while shares in Yahoo itself have lagged. It’s a good thing that Yahoo has both its Asian assets — the value of them now makes up most of the company’s valuation. Until, of course, Mayer figures out a way to turn the money Yahoo is getting into more gold.

Some would have a single board; others would have multiple boards. Monitors would have the authority to delete posts. 3) Monitors would be instructed to immediately delete: - All political comments. After seeing their posts gone within minutes, the posters will get the idea that they should move to the political board. -All posts touting other stocks. -All garbage posts (HaHaHaHa) and unsubstantiated opinions (the stock will close green...). If there is no reason or no "because", the post is gone. -All serial spam leading to URL's designed to steal from Yahoo users and advertisers. In addition, the spammers ID's would be reported to a responsible individual at Yahoo for immediate cancellation along with other ID's issued to the same party. Also, the URL's would be reported to their IP's for cancellation. 4) Yahoo would then approach various company's investor relations department to ask them to use the message boards (now cleaned up) to disseminate information to shareholders and potential investors; and to enter discussions about the company. 5) Yahoo would then approach its advertisers to explain that, while the number of posters has dropped significantly, those remaining posters are serious about the companies being discussed.

Via these horrific new message boards, Yahoo is ABUSING its peons. Yahoo's ersatz message board SUCKS. It apparently was designed with the express purpose of QUASHING communication. You can barely discern who is addressing whom. And that STUPID, STUPID time stamp . . . a message was posted 3 years 7 months ago??? What yahoo genius dreamed up THAT component of your obfuscation?!! Your so-called permalinks CHANGE with each new iteration of the page they are on. When you type another stock symbol in the box to go to that stock's message board, it does NOT go to that board but goes to this YHOO board! Try it yourself. For example, go to the CSCO board and type GOOG in the "Get Message Board for" box. Those of us with memories learned from BITTER experience that only RARELY does Yahoo implement a suggestion from a user. Because of Yahoo's intransigence, when you introduced your beta boards, countless Yahoo posters emailed, faxed, and phoned your advertisers . . . and the result was that those advertisers FLED Yahoo. THAT is why Yahoo's earnings report that quarter SHOCKED, STUNNED, other companies which, in turn, feared that their business would fall off a cliff like Yahoo's did. But, their ERs turned out to be good. Yahoo's ER was the ONLY one that showed profit had plunged. Very apparently, Yahoo did not learn its lesson then. Yahoo remained intransigent. And now Yahoo has shot itself not in the foot but in the chest.</Msg><Username>clueless_in_canarsie</Username><Timestamp>1347931509877</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 21:25:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347934543590-130</Id><Topic><Title>POLL: Will YHOO CEO Blow the Billions Faster or Slower than Obama Blew the Trillions?</Title><Username>jmambo54</Username><Timestamp>1347909490704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 15:18:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get rid of O'Blammah!</Msg><Username>jotrout</Username><Timestamp>1347934543590</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 22:15:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347936450792-131</Id><Topic><Title>O-ho the Wells Fargo Wagon is a-comin' down the street...</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1347820766443</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:39:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In your dreams</Msg><Username>pinionman</Username><Timestamp>1347936450792</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 22:47:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347938814642-132</Id><Title>Excuse me, but I'm still looking for my dad, Vanity</Title><Msg>Has anyone seen Vanity lately?
