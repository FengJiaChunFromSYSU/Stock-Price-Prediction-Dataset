They make over $40 per share so that comes out to a measly 2.5%...they could make more than that buying corporate bonds or doing a currency hedge like Yahoo did, which btw was MORE profitable last quarter than Yahoo was. Apple had revenues of $160B, last year, and buying one with $5B is pointless. Their ITunes is vastly bigger, has hundreds of TV shows, and sells something like 75% of all movies sold. Let's run some hypothetical numbers. Shares outstanding: 1.1B Yahoo Japan $9B Alibaba at 75B(10%) $7.5B...$5B after tax Alibaba final stake $150B($15B)...$10B after tax Cash and receivables: $5B if I remember right $29B/1.1=$26.36 and you want another $20 or $22B which is 4 TIMES revenue or about 25X's operating profit for a stagnant core with no moat around anything? Apple's LICENSING deal with HTC is almost as profitable as Yahoo's core and it cost them nothing. ****Apple isn't buying Yahoo as their stock buyback and debt raise boosted the share price multiple Yahoo's. Apple is in the PRODUCT business and outside of IAd they have no link together. Apples worst products have margins far higher than Yahoo even. Sounds great to dream but the reality is it would have happened long before Marissa took over if it was going to happen.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1367932939574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:22:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367933164899-24</Id><Title>"Stifel raises price target to $31 from $27; rating buy"</Title><Msg>Stifel raises price target to $31 from $27; rating buy</Msg><Username>egc992k</Username><Timestamp>1367933164899</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:26:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367933364942-25</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone's advice to buy Yahoo from $11 to $21 was spot on!</Title><Username>shelcorecrust</Username><Timestamp>1362511915833</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:31:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's all she can do at this time.

Meanwhile, Yahoo Japan, in which Yahoo owns a 35% stake, posted a 13% profit gain in 2012.

Here are the facts. In Q4, Facebook reported $1.54 billion in revenue and $64 million in net income. In Q4 (reported today, as Alibaba’s financials are reported on a 1 quarter lag in Yahoo’s filings), Alibaba did $1.84 billion and $650 million in net income. It would be odd, then, if Alibaba priced itself at $62.5 billion, given that Facebook’s market cap is currently $66 billion. Which do you think has a more sustainable long-term business model: Facebook selling ads or Alibaba transacting with 1.3 billion Chinese? If you only look at the revenue difference between the two companies, you would conclude that Alibaba should be valued at $80 billion. That suggests that Yahoo!’s 24% stake is worth $19.2 billion pre-tax or $13 billion net. Yahoo’s current market cap is $29 billion, which includes about $6.5 billion of net cash and pref shares in Alibaba, and a $6.5 billion (net) stake in Yahoo Japan. This suggests Yahoo’s “core” business is only worth about $3 billion according to the wisdom of the market (or 2x its EBITDA, when AOL AOL +2.63% (AOL) is trading at 6x).

The numbers at Alibaba, where Yahoo owns a 24% stake, were particularly impressive. The Chinese company saw its profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2012, nearly tripling to $642 million from the year-earlier period, according to the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Meanwhile, Yahoo Japan, in which Yahoo owns a 35% stake, posted a 13% year-over-year profit gain in the same period. The disclosure sent Yahoo’s shares rising more than 3% to $26.02. Barclays Capital analyst Anthony DiClemente also raised his price target to $29 from $26 “to account for our higher Alibaba valuation, as well as a slight increase in the value of Yahoo Japan since we last marked shares to market.” Alibaba’s financials, he wrote, “show very strong continuing operating momentum for Alibaba.” Alibaba’s strong performance was particularly significant in the wake of speculation that the Chinese Internet giant was about to go public which is expected to result in a profit windfall for Yahoo.</Msg><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1367959851186</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 16:50:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367959982531-102</Id><Topic><Title>wow really, i jumped ship at 24.80</Title><Username>tocamaltd</Username><Timestamp>1367958505581</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 16:28:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everybody knows that the better Alibaba and Yahoo Japan does (like what was announced today), the better it will be for Yahoo (who holds major stakes in both companies).
