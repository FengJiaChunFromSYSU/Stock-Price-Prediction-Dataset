"What you have to take into account is that they [Tmall] still haven't expanded abroad. it's just operating in the Chinese market and seeing the sales volume it's seeing at the moment," Lamine Lahouasnia, senior retail analyst at Euromonitor in London said. "If it were to start thinking about pushing the brand abroad perhaps to another Chinese speaking region of the world, we could potentially see the overtaking of Amazon happen a lot sooner," he added.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1355293763635</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 01:29:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355293792984-4</Id><Topic><Title>Very Exciting Future Ahead - Alibaba</Title><Username>stoxtxholdem</Username><Timestamp>1355292156743</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 01:02:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tmall, run by China's second-largest Internet company Alibaba Group, has already overtaken popular consumer to consumer (C2C) portal or online auctioneer, eBay in sales this year, according to Euromonitor.

Yahoo hadn't updated the app since last year, so new Flickr fits in quite nicely with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer's commitment to a mobile-first strategy. The new app features a simpler sign-up process, 16 camera filters and full groups capabilities, which used to only be available on Flickr.com. Unlike Instagram, Flickr provides support for Twitter, in addition to Facebook, Tumblr, and email. Earlier this week, Instagram pulled the plug on Twitter, making it no longer possible to view Instagram photos in your Twitter stream.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1355325091675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 10:11:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355325214000-16</Id><Title>Yahoo Takes on Instagram with Flickr Upgrade</Title><Msg>Unlike Instagram, Flickr provides support for Twitter, in addition to Facebook, Tumblr, and email.

This is the same person that didn't know how many months are in a year, thought search was worth $20B, used GOOGLE finance to know earnings date even though he should know where Yahoo Investor Relations is. Back in 09', I asked a question pertaining to RPE and he still hasn't answered. His ONLY defense is A)Accuse everyone of being me when its him who has more IDs then anyone put together B)Uses opinions of others like Eric Jackson, Motley Fool or SeekingAlpha as he can't think on his own or C)Make up tons and tons of stuff with his impersonating MB99 ID that is NEVER right. Add in the fact he's narcissistic, has no friends, and parents that obviously disowned him you have an out of the closet stalking d'bag!

If this new Flickr update is any indicator, all of Yahoo’s properties are about to be Mayer-ized. And that means they’re collectively worth a lot more than they’re being valued at today. Flickr now is the best mobile photo app on the market, in my view. It’s still not the biggest. Instagram has over 100 million users. But Flickr was at 80 million mobile users before this update. Flickr has a serious shot at taking back the top spot that was once theirs.

However, I do suppose it's easy to make that assumption considering this was my first post. Truthfully, I've been following this board since right around the time Marissa took over. I decided to finally make my first post today out of sheer boredom. I can assure you though that this is my one and only ID. I'm not Hotmodel or anybody else on this board. In fact, I disagree with Hotmodel on many things, but I think it's because we're playing different games. I like to make money when stocks go up. It seems Hotmodel likes to make money when stocks go down. Nothing wrong with that. We may be playing different games but we'll both have our opportunity to win. What annoys me about Coldone is his general attitude about investing. It seems he wants me to believe that he's perfect or something. More in-the-know and smarter than anyone who has ever invested before. Drop the act and get real. But! For reference: Coldone asked everybody if we would buy or sell YHOO @ 19 with $1m. I would buy. With maximum leverage. Like I said, I'm bullish on YHOO. I believe it is severely undervalued. I believe we're going to see a stronger performance out of YHOO than we saw out of AOL over the last 12 months. And in case you don't know, that's an EXTREMELY strong performance. However, I'm not so delusion that I don't think I could be wrong. It's my experiences that the people that think they're invincible are truly the people that are the most vulnerable.</Msg><Username>lionstigersandbulls</Username><Timestamp>1355353156567</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 17:59:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355353380391-100</Id><Title>WHATIS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN AAPL MANAGER AND A YAHOO MANAGER?</Title><Msg>When an AAPL manager messes up (as with iPhone maps, for example), he ends up working somewhere else.

Like I said, I'm not afraid of being wrong. 90% of the people you meet on these boards are decidedly long or decided short. And it's impossible to convince them that they're not always right. Very few actually play both sides. In fact, I'm biased towards being decidedly long myself. For the most part, I only invest in stocks that I feel if I went into a coma today - I would wake up as a rich man. For this reason, I don't often short my stocks. In fact, the time I spend with a cash position is generally a refreshing little breather from the mayhem. Netflix was probably a good pickup. Solid growth and I believe there's a pretty good chance they'll be snatched up by one of the major tech companies soon. What's their price tag right now? $5bil market cap and some change? I mean, even the Alibaba stake that Yahoo still has is bigger than Netflix. And then you have Apple (who I think is highly likely to end up with Netflix) with $100bil cash on hand. -shrug- Hey, here's a good question for ya: Do you follow Groupon? What do you think their shares will be going for in a year? It's hard to tell, imo.

The analysts upgraded MSFT from “Hold” to “Buy” with a price target of $32. The new target is a +17% upside from Tuesday’s closing price of $27.32. Standpoint Research analyst Ronnie Moas notes, “We have gone in-and-out of MSFT twice in the last four years…Since we last exited MSFT in September 2011 the shares have underperformed the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P-500 by 1500 basis points. The stock has dropped 15% in the last three months and once again looks attractive (especially relative to the S&amp;P). “MSFT seems to be on track to compete with its current strategy, well-received new products [Xbox, Windows 8, Surface and Office]and upgrades.” Microsoft shares were up slightly (+0.77%) in premarket trading on Wednesday. The stock is up +5.24% year-to-date. Microsoft is one of the world’s largest software researchers and manufacturers. The company is well known for its Windows operating system products, as well as the Xbox gaming system, Microsoft Office software, and its recent entry into the tablet and smartphone markets. In the most recent quarter, MSFT reported net income of $4.47 billion on revenues of $16 billion.</Msg><Username>big_saciccio</Username><Timestamp>1355369482660</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 22:31:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355369633852-122</Id><Title>SPECIAL DIVIDEND TIME</Title><Msg>running out of time in fiscal cliff</Msg><Username>boogaloozzz</Username><Timestamp>1355369633852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 22:33:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355369730569-123</Id><Topic><Title>Hotmodel said Yahoo was dead money at $15.80 about 6 weeks ago, Yahoo is now $19.14!</Title><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1354812926449</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 11:55:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hotmodel was wrong.</Msg><Username>theco1done</Username><Timestamp>1355369730569</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 22:35:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355371334190-124</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone's Buys at $11, $12, $13, $14, $15, $16, $17 and $18 are all up!</Title><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1354656401298</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 16:26:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes...</Msg><Username>theco1done</Username><Timestamp>1355371334190</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 23:02:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355371798088-125</Id><Topic><Title>SPECIAL DIVIDEND TIME</Title><Username>boogaloozzz</Username><Timestamp>1355369633852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 22:33:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you have to trust MM regarding how to dispense the $3.4B YHOO received from Alibaba.

So, raise your standards. They should do buybacks AND issue a small special dividend. Also, taking the cash and buying things in the internet world has not always turned to be good investments. The shareholders over the past 5 years have had a lot of pain, but you didn't see the board make any sacrifices themselves as they heaped loads of options on themselves, and they still are doing that.</Msg><Username>cjclink3</Username><Timestamp>1355374104497</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 23:48:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
