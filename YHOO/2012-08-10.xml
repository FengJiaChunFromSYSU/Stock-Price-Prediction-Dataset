Buy back shares, which appear to be going down on the news, and invest some in developing products. The only bad thing I see is the timing of the announcement of the "review". If Alibaba paid off tomorrow then it would be fine. But, for those holding shares the news is not so good if the pps keeps dropping between now and the Alibaba payment. Of course, in the long run.....the buying back shares should (but may not) ultimately increase the value of shares.</Msg><Username>firsttestcase</Username><Timestamp>1344571410859</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 00:03:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344572796606-2</Id><Topic><Title>Smart move for Marissa is not a smart move for yahoo..</Title><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1344569779316</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:36:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Share buyback has always proven to be a nonproductive use of money. Those companies which tend to do it are basically saying that they have no more ideas, no more growth. I give up. Here, take the money. We cannot figure out a use for it. Rather than just crawl along year after year, Yahoo now has the ability to really expand their business. Sure it may be risky. But the alternative would be to see the pps trade in the same channel for years to come.</Msg><Username>tlee22202</Username><Timestamp>1344572796606</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 00:26:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344573264882-3</Id><Topic><Title>Smart move for Marissa is not a smart move for yahoo..</Title><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1344569779316</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:36:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lol...u buyback shares when they are cheap, that is the idea behind some of these so called earnings beat and investors have rewarded company doing these smart moves in the long run.

For Marissa to toy with the extra loot while yahoo already has 2bn to play with is reckless.

I was vilified for it. Oh, the longs here were creaming themselves thinking about receiving a big, fat dividend payout that was soon to be coming their way. I was laughing at the naivete. You think that's YOUR money? heheh. How foolish. There was no way that those controlling YHOO were going to get billions of dollars and give it to little shareholders like you rather than roll the dice on recapturing YHOO's glory days. Why wouldn't the new CEO swing for the fences? She has no downside. Like a hedge fund manager playing with other people's money. Heads she becomes a superstar "the woman who saved Yahoo", tails she's Carly Fiorina. No matter what she is filthy rich. I see a lot of negativity regarding what YHOO might do with the money, but I think that is premature. Had they not invested in Alibaba, the stock would be almost worthless. So....you never know. The odds are they will waste the money. True. That's what history has shown us. But every now and then, it does work out for the better. Either way, the RISK in Yahoo just went up dramatically. Invest accordingly.</Msg><Username>slickvguy</Username><Timestamp>1344573580773</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 00:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344574232947-6</Id><Topic><Title>Surprised?</Title><Username>slickvguy</Username><Timestamp>1344573580773</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 00:39:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did the risk really go up?

By announcing her view and impending plan for the cash, Marissa is virtually confirming: 1- There is much better use for the cash to grow Yahoo as a destination like YELP(she expressed she like to buy) and Google (she knew how they cashed in on search). 2- She implied that Jack Ma's cash is mostly likely to be announced VERY SOON (not yet priced into the stock price EVER). 3- She is about to reveal why Loeb and BOD hire: * a young Engineer with no CEO experience * 3 months from delivery * AND gave her a $100 MILLION package ???? If she is only good at SHOPPING with OPM, Loeb and BOD will be looked upon as BUFFOONS. If she can execute a plan that will greatly monetize 700M + yahoo users by deploying YELP-like strategies and Google-like search with AXIS as a platform, Loeb and BOD will be greatly vindicated and credited with their decision to offer $100Million and hired a lady engineer whom is 6 month pregnant.</Msg><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1344609805556</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 10:43:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344609845822-83</Id><Title>Just saw list that has YHOO as #4 most visited web site in world and Y-Jap and Taoboa also in....</Title><Msg>....the top 15.

My problem with her suggestion that she may not be issuing a dividend or even buy back stock is the timing of it. There was no reason for her to say anything right now. She already announced on Day 1 of her tenure that she would be reviewing YAHOO's business and policies for the first few months, so there was no reason to reiterate that now and combine it with a statement that the potential dividend/buyback plan may be abandoned. The way to do that would be to make the decision in private and then announce that change in policy at the same time that she announces what exactly she proposes to do with the money. The way she chose to do it, the inevitable result was a substantial reduction in the price of YHOO stock due to massive sales by disgruntled, nervous and fed-up shareholders. I can't think of any reason for her recent announcement other than a deliberate attempt to deflate the price of YHOO shares, so that certain people will benefit -- people like Loeb (or even herself), for instance, who probably wouldn't mind the chance to buy YHOO on the cheap one or two more times. However, I think that is contrary to the duties she owes to other shareholders, particularly those who may need to sell their YHOO shares now for economic or emergency reasons. One other problem I have with this is that it's one more example of how this company is looking more and more like a chicken running around with its head cut off. One day, we have dividends and buybacks, the next day we have acquisitions instead. One day we're a media company, the next day we're a tech company. One day we're compacting the company, the next day we're expanding. One day, we're cutting payroll, the next day we're going to add tons of new high-cost engineers. No wonder the market remains leary of this stock.</Msg><Username>sjones8924</Username><Timestamp>1344616486508</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 12:34:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344616680515-150</Id><Topic><Title>Big brother lives!</Title><Username>bobbobwhite</Username><Timestamp>1344616340223</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 12:32:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guess Yahoo has a standard by which they allow posts.

Perhaps, keeping 4 billion dollars in Yahoo will make a merger or buy out more plausible? I always thought Mayer was just a figure head before Yahoo sells ... I honestly think Yahoo got a bunch great stuff and all they have to do is to connect the dots... I see improvements while Levinsohn was in charge.

In the history of tech acquisitions, there is probably way more overspending/writeoffs/failures on an epic level (HP, AOL,EDS, MSFT...) than positive outcomes. That is why institutionals are dumping shares today, the odds of a good outcome is low, and this is a risk/reward game. Instead of investors getting a healthy payout so they can decide on their own how to invest the proceeds, Marissa believes she can do it for them by spending when Nasdaq valuations are at its highest levels... yeah, that will make any investor nervous as hell. Marissa is gambling, but she is guaranteed $70 million so what does she care if her acquisitions flop? even she gets lucky and that 1% chance of success and she hits lotto, her career is minted and she can have any other CEO tech job later on. I would do the same if I were Marissa, take the chances because upside only for CEO, no downside...for shareholders, different story, u are screwed.</Msg><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1344624710472</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 14:51:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344624734580-234</Id><Topic><Title>Mayer really showed her inexperience and hurt YHOO shareholders badly.</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1344617519147</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 12:51:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ok fine..point taken.Then we should know what that is within 2 weeks.If its a material event that they want to buy another company then great..i am fine with them buying another company.Just announce the comapny and lets move on.Dont kill the stock saying you MIGHT do this or that and then weeks later you still havent done anything</Msg><Username>whatdidido1970</Username><Timestamp>1344624734580</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 14:52:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344624871006-235</Id><Title>wall street pigs don't like women running companies</Title><Msg>You thought the times had changed.</Msg><Username>glasswall100</Username><Timestamp>1344624871006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 14:54:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344624887720-236</Id><Topic><Title>Mayer really showed her inexperience and hurt YHOO shareholders badly.</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1344617519147</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 12:51:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it seems that millionaires and billionaires disagree since the stock is getting killed.if its such a good decision ..why is the stock down so much.I have no problem with them buying another company with the money...just announce that you doing that WHEN YOUR READY TO DO IT.No the stock can selloff for weeks/months until they say what they are doing.Its #$%$</Msg><Username>whatdidido1970</Username><Timestamp>1344624887720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 14:54:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344625087323-237</Id><Title>Atta Girl!
