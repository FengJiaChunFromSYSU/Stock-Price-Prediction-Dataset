Most notably, this fund manager has earned a another sizable return on a new investment called ChromaDex (OTC: CDXC), which I flagged in my past article. I have been monitoring Honig’s SEC filings as ChromaDex has rallied on increasing volume, more block purchases by insiders, and a slew of press releases. He has not sold a single share. Instead, insiders have acquired 2.3 million more shares. Why? Well, according to Stone Street Advisors, ChromaDex’s September 20th clinical presentation and its associated business implications could increase ChromaDex’s stock price by hundreds of percentage points. Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, however, let’s talk about the man who already predicted a similar rally last year. Barry Honig In the unlikely event that you recognize the name Barry Honig, it is probably because you are familiar with interCLICK (NASDAQ: ICLK). Barry Honig’s only significant media coverage occurred during the years 2009 through 2011, when he served as Director of interCLICK. Honig helped interCLICK grow rapidly and eventually helped secure its $270 million acquisition by Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO). After earning a small fortune in that deal, Honig left traditional executive roles and transitioned into his new career of strategic investing. If you search Honig’s name at the Security and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) website, you will quickly discover his involvement with a large number of investments. Although he is very active, one investment (that I noted in my previous article) is particularly interesting for one, enormously simple reason. In September 2011, Honig’s investment firm bought 5.5% of BroadVision’s stock at $8.50 per share. Within six months, BroadVision hit $56 per share. Click here to see an annotated chart of BVSN. Many journalists have attempted to explain BroadVision’s perplexing 600% rally. It is widely known, for example, that a special interest group known as the National Inflation Association was spreading awareness about BroadVision stock in late 2011 and early 2012. Nevertheless, for whichever of the many reasons that BroadVision rallied 600%, we know with certainty that Honig bought millions of dollars at precisely the right time. His investment went largely unpublished before I dug through SEC filings myself. While digging, my shovel hit a new investment. Now, I will admit, it took quite a bit of filtering to narrow my investigation to a single company. Honig and his related investment vehicles are buying and selling various securities on a daily basis. His SEC record is extensive, to put it mildly, and sorting through the noise of his thousands of filings was no easy task. Perhaps (I laughingly thought in exhaustion), Honig hides his footprints on purpose, or perhaps it is simply standard practice to trade this often. Regardless, it took me a while to figure out where the majority of Honig was ultimately routing his money. So, I dug. Finally, I discovered a small company called ChromaDex.". . .

And the Alibaba sale is not a rumor. Payment will come according to the date in the contract, September 20. The deal was announced in May and financing secured weeks ago. So there is nothing in this matter the market hasn´t known for a long time. This is a small event that they may not even bother to announce until the quarterly report. The market was not very pleased with getting $4.2 billion for an asset rumored to be worth $9 billion and growing. Very expensive cash when Yahoo doesn´t need any cash under its pillow.

Other than making some key hires I don't think that we have gotten any real news from mgt.</Msg><Username>kenrsmith2003</Username><Timestamp>1347980468045</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:01:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347980472840-36</Id><Topic><Title>O-ho the Wells Fargo Wagon is a-comin' down the street...</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1347820766443</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:39:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The way Yahoo is moving up means the money is on the way.</Msg><Username>opengslide</Username><Timestamp>1347980472840</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:01:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347981035135-37</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo's value as of Wednesday will be $49 Billion!</Title><Username>brex742</Username><Timestamp>1347908053017</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 14:54:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo will go to $30 the day Alibaba group announces their IPO.</Msg><Username>shelcorecrust</Username><Timestamp>1347981035135</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:10:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347981083596-38</Id><Title>Yahoo! completes initial sale of shares to Alibaba, Bloomberg reports</Title><Msg>AllthingsD...Bloomberg...</Msg><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1347981083596</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:11:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347981087489-39</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo will more than triple their $2 billion in cash Wednesday</Title><Username>bflathalfdim</Username><Timestamp>1347921529137</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 18:38:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo shorts are bailing out.</Msg><Username>ashton10shyof</Username><Timestamp>1347981087489</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:11:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347981185095-40</Id><Title>Alibaba Closes $7.6 Billion Yahoo Deal Two Months Early</Title><Msg>Yahoo has closed the multi-billion-dollar sale of half its assets in China’s Alibaba Group.

Thus once again, Yahoo US is valued at zero or even a negative value. Never mind the over $1B in annual cash flow it produces, 700 million users and a huge portfolio of patents in their war chest.

The value is already in the stock price. If you had a house worth $500,000 and sold it for cash, would you be "worth" any more than you are now? The question is - What will Yahoo do with that cash? Based on their history that I won't repeat here because I don't want this post to be deleted, the money will be wasted. It will be spent on "initiatives" or acquisitions, both of which will end up as write-offs. It is as if you took the $500,000 from your house sale and spent it all on lottery tickets rather than, for example, putting it in mutual funds or giving it to your kids.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1347988789923</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 13:19:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347988867198-115</Id><Topic><Title>Bought Yahoo at $15.70</Title><Username>smedleypuddles</Username><Timestamp>1347985419147</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 12:23:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shareholders will get half the money in a stock buyback.</Msg><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1347988867198</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 13:21:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347989271892-116</Id><Topic><Title>I think at least a 5% spike tomorrow</Title><Username>jpalopoli</Username><Timestamp>1347978759380</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 10:32:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sure I use their "service". But I don't pay for it! Like many, many of the "users", I am a freeloader. At best, they can count my "visits" when they solicit advertisers, but the advertisers know how to measure results and will pay for advertising accordingly. Yahoo's asset value is no secret. There have been posts like yours for years. So question - what would you pay for $1million in cash that was in the hands of a company with a known track record of wasting it on useless initiatives and acquisitions that eventually had to be written off? What we are seeing now is a valid Yahoo "discount" based on history and experience.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1347989271892</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 13:27:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347989451174-117</Id><Topic><Title>EVERYBODY KNOWS</Title><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1347988789923</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 13:19:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you have a house worth $500,000 it doesn't ACTUALLY mean you'll get $500,000 for it.

The big money swore off Yahoo a long-time ago after the MSFT fiasco and thus you have the manipulation.</Msg><Username>emat12000</Username><Timestamp>1347994102288</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:48:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347994103988-151</Id><Title>Good Deal YHOOOOOOOO see this stock get some traction $ 20's</Title><Msg>could see valuation to equate to $ $ 19 to $ 30 share-I have read $ 42 Billion as capitalized---so about $ 35 per share Sell????????????????????????? are you out of your mind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>oldpalos</Username><Timestamp>1347994103988</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:48:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347994241436-152</Id><Topic><Title>Why the pop all of a sudden?</Title><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1347993598100</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:39:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo is giving the majority of the Alibaba deal money back to shareholders!</Msg><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1347994241436</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:50:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347994295376-153</Id><Title>Yahoo says 85% of Alibaba Group proceeds to go to shareholders</Title><Msg>Buy Yahoo with it.

That drops the share count to under 1 billion shares. In the end, did Marissa actually keep any money here to buy shiny new startups? It does appear that they are returning a majority of the cash from the sale. She does hold back about $650 million, plus the cash on hand (as per the balance sheet). Seems like a good return for the investors, as something eventually needs to be done to grow the company. But returning the majority of the cash to shareholders is a positive first step. If the Yahoo Japan sale can be completed next, it will be a major step forward for Yahoo.</Msg><Username>pras_srini</Username><Timestamp>1347995592186</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 15:13:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347995698585-184</Id><Title>$3.65 Billion / 1.06 Bil shares float = $3.6/share</Title><Msg>“We haven’t announced specifics around the form of return of proceeds,” a Yahoo spokesperson told AllThingsD. ”The form and timing of returning proceeds will be determined by the board and management taking into consideration the best interests of the company and its shareholders.” The form and timing TBD ..... next week?

For of all it increases EPS which forces the hand of analysts. Secondly, the buybacks to this point have not been real material. This buyback could potentially take 20% of the shares off the open market. If you want to be short while that is happening good luck. I would actually rather see a massive buyback strategically timed vs. a dividend.

Its all stock buy back. Read it and weep. Hi Yahoos, Today we reached a very important milestone in our relationship with Alibaba - we closed a transaction selling some of our Alibaba Group shares for $7.6 billion. After taxes and fees, we have received approximately $4.3 billion. We'll be issuing a press release imminently. We have reviewed our strategy for the proceeds with the board of directors and have agreed that we will be returning approximately $3.65 billion to shareholders. This amount includes a 'down payment' of $646 million that we made over the past few months in the form of stock buybacks since the transaction was announced, as well as an additional $3 billion from today's proceeds. This outcome is terrific for Yahoo!. It generates liquidity to create substantial value for our shareholders, while retaining a meaningful amount in the company to invest in our future. Also, because we still own 23 percent of Alibaba's common stock, we have the opportunity to benefit from future upside when Alibaba IPOs. I'd like to take a moment to thank Tim Morse and Ron Bell and everyone on their teams who worked on this deal. Today's announcement is the result of years of savvy investment, hard work, creativity and tenacity in order to navigate an extremely complicated set of legal and tax parameters. The team's execution has been excellent and positions Yahoo! well for future growth. Congratulations! In the last few months, we have built great momentum around our company. Thank you all for staying focused on our users, advertisers, and shareholders. I'm very excited for what lies ahead!</Msg><Username>justinwangg</Username><Timestamp>1348008213273</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 18:43:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348008216055-249</Id><Title>Nope, I read everything and we are getting $3.67 per share</Title><Msg>Read it people.</Msg><Username>jimmy_fabs</Username><Timestamp>1348008216055</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 18:43:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348008306756-250</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe She Could Take Some Of That Money</Title><Username>vincent90157</Username><Timestamp>1348008152483</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 18:42:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Use Firefox.

This review process may lead to a reevaluation of, or changes to, our current plans, including our restructuring plan, our share repurchase program, and our previously announced plans for returning to shareholders substantially all of the after tax cash proceeds of the initial share repurchase under the Share Repurchase and Preference Share Sale Agreement we entered into on May 20, 2012 with Alibaba Group Holding Limited.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1348009480325</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 19:04:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348009558484-254</Id><Title>Flood of upgrades = $16.50 - $17.50 tomorrow</Title><Msg>Flood of upgrades = $16 - $17.50 tomorrow imho</Msg><Username>b2btrillionsayear</Username><Timestamp>1348009558484</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 19:05:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348009756610-255</Id><Topic><Title>Flood of upgrades = $16.50 - $17.50 tomorrow</Title><Username>b2btrillionsayear</Username><Timestamp>1348009558484</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 19:05:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>at least that, alot of movement (including myself) in AH today picking up shares before tomorrow's open.</Msg><Username>istockuu</Username><Timestamp>1348009756610</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 19:09:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348010003041-256</Id><Title>After hours</Title><Msg>It is above $16. so tomorrow may well be the day.</Msg><Username>mb525789</Username><Timestamp>1348010003041</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 19:13:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348010115866-257</Id><Topic><Title>Flood of upgrades = $16.50 - $17.50 tomorrow</Title><Username>b2btrillionsayear</Username><Timestamp>1348009558484</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 19:05:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why?

So when the sale takes place you end up with what should be no real loss in share price or at worst the amount of the purchase price when originally bought. Keeping part or 15% of the sale proceeds for investment should net out to an overall loss of $0 with regard to the assets and if all was perfect the share price should not drop(misconception on value remaining will probably cause the price to go down a little though). Good move if 85% is going to be distributed, would not mind seeing some fraction of the balance of the Alibaba Sale and also the Yahoo-Japan...........shareholders are due a lot for years of losses and stagnation.</Msg><Username>mmrb6872</Username><Timestamp>1348014150481</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 20:22:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348014772923-277</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo should buy Facebook</Title><Username>slidingmargins</Username><Timestamp>1347997936539</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 15:52:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get Lost Idiot...What, do you own shrs in FB???</Msg><Username>joco52</Username><Timestamp>1348014772923</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 20:32:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348014917953-278</Id><Topic><Title>What happened to the big bump up in stock price</Title><Username>arjayarjay</Username><Timestamp>1347991280014</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 14:01:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Patience.

According to Yahoo Finance, Key Statistics, outstanding shares are 1.18 billion (probably out of date, but let's use it for the calculation). They are giving back $3.65 billion, but .65 bil, is in the form of stock buyback. So, we get $3 billion divided by 1.18 billion shares which yields $2.54/sh. IFrankly, I hope you are correct, I'll take the extra $1/sh which you calculated since shares are in the 5 figures.

Yahoo will proceed to buy roughly 200 million shares of the 1 Billion or so outstanding shares. Today's YAHOO Market Cap is 18.8 billion and that corresponds to 1 Billion Shares. After the buyback, $18.8B corresponds to 800 million shares. This means that the Earnings Per Share should also go up assuming things do not deteriorate. Today EPS at 89cents would change to $1.07. So we should expect a 20% evaluation in our stock value after the buyback as this is a big one. Companies always do buybacks on dips and we never know about it. The price kicks in only if the EPS looks really nice that the mutual funds decide to buy in. Or is YAHOO going to buy the 200 million shares and pass them to the shareholders?</Msg><Username>spu_1998</Username><Timestamp>1348018097333</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 21:28:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348018117180-286</Id><Topic><Title>you couldnt be more wrong</Title><Username>fidoman33</Username><Timestamp>1348002571356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 17:09:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You aren't paying a premium on cash.

Perhaps something less than the full amount in the form of a special dividend and additional stock buybacks? As for the net proceeds, it looks like the Chinese government took a hefty tax bite out of the deal. Cost of doing business in China. The U.S. will tax this as a long-term capital gain. But what I really like is the fact that YHOO gets a nice chunk of preferred and STILL owns 20% of Alibaba. Just hope Alibaba files for its U.S. IPO soon. Let's not forget that the original purchase price paid for Yahoo's 40% stake in Alibaba was only $1B. That was 7 years ago.

Better Yahoo remains as it is which would imply a possibly greater value under the new CEO. Actually, this event actually devalues Yahoo!

The realized net of $4.3B is somewhat deflating to many posters.</Msg><Username>mb525789</Username><Timestamp>1348020919173</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 22:15:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348020981393-296</Id><Topic><Title>Afterhours</Title><Username>mb525789</Username><Timestamp>1348019002813</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 21:43:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree.

Whenever a special dividend is announced, all call and put strikes are reduced by the amount of the dividend. For example, on July 20, 2004 Microsoft announced a special $3 cash dividend. This was a special one-time dividend so the option strikes – calls and puts – were adjusted downward by the amount of the dividend. If you were holding the $30 call, it became a $27 strike. If you were holding the $30 put, it also became a $27 strike. Why does this happen? Again, any adjustment in option strikes is done to assure that option investors are not financially hurt (or unfairly rewarded) because of a corporate action such as a split, merger, or even a special dividend."</Msg><Username>tlee22202</Username><Timestamp>1348021954702</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 22:32:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348022621777-300</Id><Topic><Title>Share Buyback -How It Increases Shareholder Value-My Guess!</Title><Username>spu_1998</Username><Timestamp>1348018097333</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 21:28:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>However, I'm guessing that with all the new directors, managers, CEO's, etc., Yahoo is issuing a boatload of stock options.
