I was going with what their earning slides said vs. the 10-K. When giving my theoretical example on Yahoo, I went with $70B for the IPO and I think $150B for the last stake then figured in 35% for taxes on that and Yahoo Japan makes it quite difficult for the stock to double from here for example on the core alone with 1.2B shares outstanding. I agree on Apple as they're guerilla marketing experts as their advertising is like 1/100th that of Google and Microsoft or something. Morse should have negotiated a way for Yahoo shareholders to either get shares at a discount at say a $50B valuation or Yahoo sells those additional shares giving a dividend. I'm sure shareholders would have jumped in a heartbeat for those AG shares. Those holding in Yahoo would be out the AG shares but have cash up front. I say a conversion of shares cause the taxes of AG and Yahoo Japan is like $8 per share not including repatriation taxes in my example.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1356679291459</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 02:21:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356680039602-4</Id><Topic><Title>Hugh - couldn't reply on thread - what a surprise!</Title><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1356664425829</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 22:13:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you still think Yahoo was dead money at $15.80?

Just visit connectedtvDOTyahooDOTcom It's still good news though that Yahoo and Samsung extended their partnership.</Msg><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1356712970425</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 11:42:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356713037648-40</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung Teams with Yahoo on Apple TV Killer</Title><Username>trip23455</Username><Timestamp>1356640864740</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 15:41:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a Samsung/Yahoo TV.

SUNNYVALE, Calif. &amp; RIDGEFIELD PARK, N.J. -- Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO) and Samsung today announced an expanded multi-year partnership to integrate Yahoo!'s Broadcast Interactivity platform into Samsung 2012 Smart TVs. Yahoo! Broadcast Interactivity, powered by its automatic content recognition (ACR) technology, SoundPrintTM, will be deployed in Samsung's SyncPlus platform, enabling new opportunities for intelligent content discovery, advertising and engagement, bringing an unprecedented level of interactivity in the living room. With this agreement, Samsung Smart TV owners will receive real-time, actionable content that runs alongside and complements TV shows and commercials. TV viewers will see subtle, on-screen prompts informing them that additional content can be accessed. With the touch of a remote, connected tablet or phone, Samsung Smart TV viewers can easily surface content or offers related to the TV shows and commercials they are watching. In addition, TV programmers can provide complementary content like trivia, additional show insights, commerce or interactive gaming to extend engagement. Showtime Networks and National Geographic Channel are two of the initial TV programming partners. The partnership also creates new forms of advertising by extending traditional 30-second commercials into immediate actions. With broadcast interactivity-enabled commercials, advertisers can embed calls-to-action for downloading apps or digital media, providing coupons, ordering samples, reading reviews or viewing product information. "By combining watching TV with engaging content, we can change the way audiences are entertained and informed," said Ron Jacoby, vice president of Connected TV at Yahoo!. "We are thrilled that our expanded partnership with Samsung extends our platform's footprint, enabling our content partners and advertisers to reach many more consumers. Content owners can augment their programming, and advertisers can create compelling calls-to-action that allow audiences to engage on marketing messages the moment they are delivered." "Today, consumers are engaging in interactive TV program experiences more and more," said Eric Anderson, vice president of content and product solutions at Samsung Electronics America, Inc. "Samsung's SyncPlus service combined with Yahoo! Broadcast Interactivity and SoundPrint will provide consumers with a very entertaining experience. We are very pleased to partner with Yahoo! and we look forward to a successful collaboration in the years to come." Yahoo! Broadcast Interactivity leverages Yahoo!'s patented SoundPrint™ technology which enables real-time identification of live or recorded, cable, broadcast and satellite television through audio fingerprinting. Combining SoundPrint, the largest index of television audio matching, with Yahoo!'s Connected TV platform creates a full suite of capabilities for audiences, broadcasters and advertisers. Yahoo! Broadcast Interactivity and Samsung SyncPlus will be delivered in the latest firmware update to Samsung's 2012 Smart TVs in the U.S. Yahoo! Broadcast Interactivity will be integrated into future models of Samsung TVs.</Msg><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1356713396716</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 11:49:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356713640484-44</Id><Topic><Title>Good bye to Yahoo .</Title><Username>A Yahoo!

Imagine a specific restaurant or retail store commercial come up and up pops a QR code that you can scan with your phone to scan and download a coupon/offer. It's a call-to-action directly from your tv to help bring more foot traffic into the restaurant or retail store. Which advertiser wouldn't want that?? You already see some of this from cable providers such as Time Warner where they prompt you to press a certain button on your remote to get more info. But it never worked that good because they couldn't figure out how to monetize at scale. Yahoo can monetize at scale because they already work with all of the advertisers. Samsung have the best tvs on the market (I bought one after doing a lot of research) so I think this could be a great partnership.</Msg><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1356713913662</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 11:58:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356714115179-46</Id><Topic><Title>Profit by checking out these guys right now.</Title><Username>jeremyprater87</Username><Timestamp>1356697708977</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 07:28:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whoa!

Although I have no idea whether this latest Chinese rumor is true or not (although the track record of rumors reported over there is very poor), in my view, it’s quite clear that Alibaba has many reasons to do an IPO sooner rather than later and almost no reasons to wait to 2015. Here they are:</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1356721235345</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 14:00:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356721580873-60</Id><Topic><Title>Reasons Why Alibaba Will Want to IPO Sooner Rather than Later</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1356721235345</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 14:00:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1. The agreement clearly states “Under the terms of the agreement with Yahoo!, Alibaba Group has the right to repurchase one-half of Yahoo!’s remaining stake upon a qualifying initial public offering in the future.” So the question is, would Alibaba rather repurchase this half of the remaining stake (let’s call it 10% of Alibaba) when Alibaba is valued at $60 billion or $80 billion? Although Alibaba would potentially be richer with a larger valuation, I assume they’d prefer to buy back that 10% stake at a lower valuation assuming that it will quickly appreciate in the coming years, as it has in recent years. 2. To end the IP Royalty Stream (the TIPLA clause in the agreement). The May agreement states: “Alibaba will make an upfront lump sum royalty payment of US$550 million to Yahoo! and continuing royalty payments for up to four years.” The key words there are “up to.” The sooner Alibaba buys out Yahoo, the sooner they can cease this IP royalty stream to them (or at least reduce it). 3. Pay down debt which they took on to buy back Yahoo’s first tranche. 4. Although Yahoo can keep its last 10% tranche in perpetuity, the sooner Alibaba IPOs, the sooner it would have more resources to potentially offer to buy back this last tranche in a block trade, thereby maximizing the rapid expected growth of Alibaba’s share value to management and employees. 5. The last round of investors in Alibaba might want to take advantage of the monetization opportunity from the IPO even, just as Facebook (FB) investors did. 6. Alibaba’s ambitions to expand outside China. Their investments in Auctiva and Vendio are viewed as unsuccessful despite both having significant installed user bases. Having the resources to launch a US-focused platform is something that should produce results as well as compete with eBay (EBAY) in their own backyard. Talent retention. 7. Increasing costs in China for everything – salaries, taxes, equipment, etc. China is no longer cheap in the tier 1 and 2 cities. 8. Increased competition locally especially from Tencent, 360Buy, and Suning. 9. Continued strategic investments/acquisitions. For example, there have been on again off again rumors in the last month that Alibaba was going to make a strategic investment in Sina (SINA) or even buy them outright. If I was Jack Ma, I’d rather make that investment post-IPO rather than before, rather than give Sina management a lot of pre-IPO stock and see them hit the lottery later once Alibaba IPOs. 10. Finally, sooner than later would help ensure Alibaba doesn’t suffer from sky-high expectations. Think about Google‘s IPO vs. Facebook’s as an example.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1356721580873</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 14:06:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356722088718-61</Id><Title>Alibaba Group Worth $50 Billion Today</Title><Msg>According to two ex-Alibaba Group employees I’ve spoken with this week, Alibaba’s shares are now being exchanged privately valuing the company at $50 billion.

Although Alibaba would potentially be richer with a larger valuation, I assume they’d prefer to buy back that 10% stake at a lower valuation assuming that it will quickly appreciate in the coming years, as it has in recent years. 2. To end the IP Royalty Stream (the TIPLA clause in the agreement). The May agreement states: “Alibaba will make an upfront lump sum royalty payment of US$550 million to Yahoo! and continuing royalty payments for up to four years.” The key words there are “up to.” The sooner Alibaba buys out Yahoo, the sooner they can cease this IP royalty stream to them (or at least reduce it). 3. Pay down debt which they took on to buy back Yahoo’s first tranche. 4. Although Yahoo can keep its last 10% tranche in perpetuity, the sooner Alibaba IPOs, the sooner it would have more resources to potentially offer to buy back this last tranche in a block trade, thereby maximizing the rapid expected growth of Alibaba’s share value to management and employees. 5. The last round of investors in Alibaba might want to take advantage of the monetization opportunity from the IPO even, just as Facebook (FB) investors did. 6. Alibaba’s ambitions to expand outside China. Their investments in Auctiva and Vendio are viewed as unsuccessful despite both having significant installed user bases. Having the resources to launch a US-focused platform is something that should produce results as well as compete with eBay (EBAY) in their own backyard. 7. Talent retention. 8. Increasing costs in China for everything – salaries, taxes, equipment, etc. China is no longer cheap in the tier 1 and 2 cities. 9. Increased competition locally especially from Tencent, 360Buy, and Suning. 10. Continued strategic investments/acquisitions. For example, there have been on again off again rumors in the last month that Alibaba was going to make a strategic investment in Sina (SINA) or even buy them outright. If I was Jack Ma, I’d rather make that investment post-IPO rather than before, rather than give Sina management a lot of pre-IPO stock and see them hit the lottery later once Alibaba IPOs. 11. Finally, sooner than later would help ensure Alibaba doesn’t suffer from sky-high expectations. Think about Google‘s IPO vs. Facebook’s as an example.

I have every right to offer my opinion on this blog just as you do . Yahoo does'nt need your help . If you know and understand how to read financials then have someone read or interpret for you those for Baidu . I suggest you go to another board if you can't take the heat . Baidu is a better investment with more people on its site in China than any other Company . Read the facts instead of trying to think your a big shot , which your not. P.S. Only a wimp hiding behind a board would dare to threaten to "crush " anyone . Believe me you would'nt get to far .</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

Be careful on investing in this. It has a high valuation that will plunge if they continue to get more competition. They are not in as good of position as you think. You need to read the facts and do better research on them. Yahoo is in a better position with LESS downside then Baidu. I have invested in Baidu in the past and would be very careful now. They have slowing numbers that may continue as the computition increases.

You keep harping about financials but all you've stated is that Baidu has a lot of people on it's site. If that's you're strategic position, then you're in for a year of hurt. I read the financials and they said Alibaba is worth more than Baidu which is why I posted that quote for you to read and "analyze". By the way, this isn't a blog it's a message board.
