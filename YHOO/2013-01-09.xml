This can all be done in a automated fashion, unless you are GM or some other large company that wants to craft a special national campaign. I think what is obvious is that you and your company are not sophisticated enough to be using the Internet and you really should considering liquidating your business.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1357733661579</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 07:14:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357734996759-3</Id><Topic><Title>How does yahoo stay in business?</Title><Username>dsc20601</Username><Timestamp>1357693592312</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:06:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not smart enough to know a billion dollars a year free cash flow would keep anyone afloat.</Msg><Username>randywms</Username><Timestamp>1357734996759</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 07:36:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357741058938-4</Id><Topic><Title>Should you steer clear of YHOO?
