Because it is illegal. And if they buy back shares and retire them it does not make YHOO worth more per share. The cash Yahoo uses to buy shares is no longer a part of the value of Yahoo; the total value of Yahoo goes down giving you the same value per share. There are no hocus-pocus juggling tricks that can make the value of Yahoo grow. The last $3 billion buyback did nothing for the share price. No free money.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1349529632929</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 09:20:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349532347249-8</Id><Topic><Title>Update on feedback and action taken by message board team</Title><Username>ugc.team</Username><Timestamp>1347022841028</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:00:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Each report abuse post is manually moderated with 24 hours of SLA.</Msg><Username>ugc.team</Username><Timestamp>1349532347249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 10:05:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349532825252-9</Id><Title>Earnings CC and News</Title><Msg>On Oct 22, Yahoo will announce Q3 earnings.
