This is the killer app. YHOO is moving in this direction with Ross. Ross's content is great. But the delivery is really poor. The videos lag and run slowly. The delivery is unstable. And YHOO hasn't really brought to life all the extras the internet can add to video content, eg Searching within the video (eg, clicking on an actor to bring up his / her IMDB profile; clicking on scenery to bring up the wikipedia page for the place); live chatting with a fan community on the video as it streams...etc) Marissa could build for YHOO the killer platform for streaming internet video. Then Ross could stay on, not as CEO, but as YHOO studio head. That's the path towards becoming a $200 billion company. Hope they take it.</Msg><Username>argent_a_bend_gules</Username><Timestamp>1343015273042</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 23:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
