Another Homeland Security debacle. Homeland Security is a debacle which is trying to weazle it's way into the law enforcement scene. Homeland Security should be a 100% closed operation. Bush had another bad dream when he and his flunkies came up with another layer of the police. We already have homeland security. it is called the FBI and the Pentagon. When Homeland Security is shutdown, the money can go back to the pentagon and fbi. Don't worry so much. All of these privatized agencies need to be reabsorbed by the government 100%. All of the finanical debacle is from the planning and mismanagement of the privatards that have sticky fingers and no allegiance to the flag.</Msg><Username>susiesweatsocks</Username><Timestamp>1365157598230</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 06:26:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365159358625-7</Id><Topic><Title>Shock: Do you Know that Yahoo's mobile search...</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1365122036611</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 20:33:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BTW, Bing mobile search is non existent!</Msg><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1365159358625</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 06:55:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365159678476-8</Id><Topic><Title>Shock: Do you know that Yahoo made today $105.9M?</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1365117263874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 19:14:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New 10-k: "Net Investment Exposure.

It appears Yahoo engaged in some savvy negotiating, N. Venkat Venkatraman, a business professor at Boston University, told the E-Commerce Times. "It is compelling Microsoft to meet -- and beat -- not only Yahoo's trailing 12 month performance in terms of Revenue Per Search but also Google's estimated RPS." Yahoo can also terminate if Microsoft attempts to exit the algorithmic search or search monetization markets.</Msg><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1365181828577</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 13:10:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365182077564-48</Id><Title>Yahoo CEO says Microsoft search deal not delivering 'desired results'</Title><Msg>ahoo's Chief Executive Marissa Mayer has said the firm's search partnership with Microsoft is not delivering the market share gains or the revenue boost that it should. Mayer, at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference in San Francisco, said that 'one of the points of the alliance is that we collectively want to grow share rather than just trading share with each other.' Mayer said of the search deal with Microsoft that they 'need to see monetization working better because they know that it can and they have seen other competitors in the space illustrate how well it can work,' Fox News reports. Yahoo and Microsoft entered into a 10-year search partnership in 2010, hoping their combined efforts could mount a more competitive challenge to Google, the report said.

I don't think they have ever met this benchmark, have they? With the guarantee in place, they had no reason to terminate. If, in fact, they could have - lots of legalese in that agreement. I don't think it was a simple as trailing 12-month average, they were locked-in to specific dates before they could terminate.

IF I am paying for goods or services I am a "customer", while you apparently feel that looking at Yahoo sites for free (you are here for free??) makes you somehow a customer. THE ONLY WAY you can influence Yahoo's behaviour (or survival) is through your response to their customers, the advertisers. And that my friend is VERY INDIRECT LEVER... Case in point, my two ads are CISCO and something about my testosterone; neither of which will be getting any $$ from me in the foreseeable future.</Msg><Username>stockscouter9000</Username><Timestamp>1365199185772</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 17:59:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365199223237-64</Id><Topic><Title>Shock: Do you know that Yahoo's percentage of global internet users...</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1365122570427</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 20:42:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for keeping us updated.

I think its greatly improved lately as I watched the Justin Timberlake hosted SNL episode on it from a few weeks ago. The commercials weren't irritating even if the same thing...Swifter, I think, or some other house product. The streaming was great, way better than Yahoo's at times and better then the major networks. As for its value, its worth way more than $500M, it was rumored to be between $2-$4B to Yahoo if it came with exclusive content deals. Netflix, paid like $1B for Starz or Showtimes content, last year, I think. I just remember it went up exponentially from the previous contract. The article I just read mentions that Providence Equity group sold its 10% stake for $200M and shoved it into the Chernin Group only to want it reinvested into Hulu apparently. It's revenue is $700M and that would be like Yahoo's core with $5B in revenue being worth under $4B, a steal. I do think Yahoo should make a stab at it or at the Chernin Group which seems to be accumulating high-tech companies in the film and TV arena.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1365209205497</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 20:46:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365209694379-73</Id><Topic><Title>Shock: Do you know that Yahoo made today $105.9M?</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1365117263874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 19:14:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I did but apparently you didn't see which ID I was replying to did you?
