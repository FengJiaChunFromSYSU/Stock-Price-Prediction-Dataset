Your view that "non-productive" employees will be the ones more likely to leave doesn't comport with the reality that the most productive/creative employees are the one more likely to select an employer that works for them. And have just marched back to the in-place, assembly-line work place of old Yahoo's chances of attracting others "more talented" seems very unlikely. When Yahoo's in-place workforce policy is more retro than that of the major defense contractor I retired from, nothing good (for Yahoo) is likely to come of this move.</Msg><Username>stockscouter9000</Username><Timestamp>1361952751585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 03:12:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361954135665-5</Id><Title>I feel bad for Mayer's infant. All talented Moms at yahoo will now leave - Women are the best talent</Title><Msg>Every developed country in the world has culturally accepted and in many cases legally demanded flex time and working from home when the children are too young for school. Every succssful American company encourages flex time, and allowing parents to work from home when their children are too young for scholl is so common that it is assume and no longer thought of as a perk but in fact a way to increase productivity and create loyalty which results in much more value added ideas and products. Parents, most often women, have taken top executive positions around the world without sacrificing their families. The mothers that chose or worse, forced to show total commitment to work both in time and emotional involvement are prove to be the exact parents who create the kind of kids that have killed dozens of school children over the past 5 years. Fathers and Mothers work flex time and at home not because they want to maintain the old housewife traditional family but because they CHOOSE to perform excellently at work AND raise their children the best way known - having either Dad or Mom with them as much as possible and ready to be there immediately when needed. Now Mayer has shown that women at yahoo better drop that baby and get back to work in a week and forget their kids, put them in a day care for the 12 hours a day you are supposed to work at the office and to hell with what the children need in the most important first 5 years of life - screw them up so they can shoot a school room of other kids when they reach their teen age years and realize that their parents could not give a hoot about what they need. Mayer and her ilk say screw the kids, get to work. Of course Mayer has at least 1 Nanny, at least 2 housekeepers, at least 2 chefs, a limo on call, a driver, a corporate plane on call and I her infant spends more timewith strangers than with his biological parents Yahoo is clearly not a state or the art, cutting edge, future oriented company. Watch out - talent disappears quickly and Mayer can not attract the best when she shows that distrust and freedom and trust do not exist. The honeymoon is over, way over, and Yahoo is now treating employees like Mayer treated ABC and this is consistent with the "new" home page which is just like the old one that has been their for 6 years except now it Scrolls "FROM THE BOTTOM!" - ANY WEB DESIGNER COULD ADD THAT FEATURE IN 30 MINUTES AND IT IS CONSIDERED A NEWS WORTHY ANNOUNCEMENT BY MAYER. My investments are heavily based upon the character of the executive team and Mayer is revealing day by day that she is over her head.</Msg><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1361954135665</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 03:35:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361956794949-6</Id><Title>Yahoo stock not going anywhere without dividend</Title><Msg>Your investment is being used as revenue to feul a polical news media propaganda machine for propping up democrats, paying yahoo workers full time for working 25hr weeks, and pay lucrative salaries and bonuses to yahoo management.

Are you saying that a multi-national, global, technology company should make everyone around the world come to a single brick building before the company can increase profits? So outsourcing does not work, having employees in motion using mobile communication does not work. Giving everyone an iPhone and then forcing them into one building which makes a phone irrelevant is logical exactly how? So you all work inside a brick building and you are supposed to develop mobile products when the compan policy prevents anyone from living and working in that same mobile world. Should Mayer stay in the office and not travel? Her decision is rediculous and every talented professional knows it. You DO NOT punish good performers by issuing a blanket rule that has a negative impact on good performers and excuse it by saying you are really indirectly going to weed out the poor performers. So good performers have no motivationo to work hard and earn new flexibilities and trust because the poor eprformers will alway slead Maeyr to crack down en masse and clearly has no idea how to identify good people from poor people. So how does this really work in Yahoo's favor. Do you think anyone would go to yahoo when it is 99% likely that their current company's remote work and employee trust culture is significantly more encouraging than yahoo which is taking large stridsebackward?</Msg><Username>quantum_analyst</Username><Timestamp>1361971332877</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 08:22:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361971502252-20</Id><Title>Donkeys</Title><Msg>Yahoo censors are #$%$, #$%$ are donkeys</Msg><Username>newguyhere</Username><Timestamp>1361971502252</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 08:25:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361971910897-21</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Steve!

After I retired, I worked as a Consultant for a federal agency, and worked from home. I found I was not taking breaks but working through lunch, and amazed when (a it ws past 5 pm and (b) I suffered eye strain from the computer monitor. Contrast that with the federal employees also working from home, who I could never reach on the taxpayer-provided cell phones, they responded to emails the next day, and in the office they spent two hours at lunch to go shopping. YAHOO! has serious and creative professional employees, unlike the government, and getting them out of the home office is not only healthy from a psychological standpoint, but improves accessibility and communication - essential for their work. MM made a brave but excellent decision, and I hope other companies follow.</Msg><Username>cibor</Username><Timestamp>1362001034073</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 16:37:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362001495691-111</Id><Topic><Title>Sold today</Title><Username>bribeavis</Username><Timestamp>1361916823951</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 17:13:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm suspicious of people who claim to have bought stocks at their absolute low, and then advocate a SELL position during an incredible upswing momentum.

By deleting urls which link to contrarian analysis, particularly of pink sheet fraud promoters WHILE allowing both the spam bots and the actual paid advertising from the stock shill firms Yahoo potentially opens itself to being joined as a recovery defendant for any tout firm hit with a civil suit. Step 1: Yahoo advertiser penalized in SEC action. Step 2: Yahoo records reveal suppression of message board postings against that advertiser (Yahoo facilitates their activities as it were). Step 3: Plaintiffs, recognizing that the touts are long gone and damages unrecoverable, attempts to join Yahoo in the "I"ve been swindled" case. Step 4: ?? Winning isn't everything, sometimes just shining a bright light can be cringe worthy.

It seems clear that Yahoo! has lost control over these workers and I applaud Mayer for taking the difficult but right step to have all 'report' in. Lots of disagreement out there amongst journalists &amp; bloggers. Some of the most vocal complainers on this issue, were the most vocal protectors of Mayer &amp; her right to skip maternity leave, stating it was no one elses business, but Mayer's. I would say that unless you work for Yahoo! or are a shareholder, WTH does it matter to you. I was reading a BI article the other day that gave an account of the awful culture and underproductivity encountered at JCP by Ron Johnson's team. Here's an excerpt of COO Michael Kramer explaining what they were hit with : "There were 4,800 employees at the HQ in January 2012, and in one month they had watched five million YouTube videos during work hours. He said that 35 percent of bandwidth at HQ was used for "loafing off." One big consequence was the culling of staff. Now, a little more than a year later, 1,600 of those workers have been sent packing. Another was the total destruction of the company's old corporate culture, which led to dissent among the ranks of executives at the home office who didn't agree with the changes." I'm not saying Mayer has encountered anything as bad as above, but we pay her top dollar to take this company that for many reasons, was severely lagging behind its peers, back to it's prime. I will trust that as unpleasant at it is to uproot off-site workers lives, it is being done for the betterment of the company. That's what we complained about in the past right. Get rid of slackers, cut the bloat blah, blah, blah. Well now Yahoo has someone in charge that is willing to face this serious issue head on.</Msg><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1362025343795</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 23:22:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362025434624-131</Id><Topic><Title>Working from home generally means...</Title><Username>josejimenezrubenstein</Username><Timestamp>1362016666004</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 20:57:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I really wish Congress and their staff would "work from home"!
