We believe that adding more content, such as product pricing and inventory information from Krillion, and presenting that content in a useful way to our users, will ultimately drive more organic and SEO traffic over time, both of which are our high margin traffic sources, compared to SEM sourced traffic. We plan to add more content to the website by launching verticals that appeal to our core demographic of soccer moms – for example: shopping; education; and health &amp; wellness. If we are able to increase the amount of type-in and SEO traffic that our flagship-site receives, we may be able to reduce our reliance on lower-margin traffic we acquire from other search engines. • Add new targeted brands, products and services: We also expect to add new brands, products and services to our O&amp;O business unit over time. Additionally, we anticipate that much of the content we develop or acquire for our own O&amp;O properties may also be useful to enhance the product and content offerings we make to our network partners. Our Octane360 acquisition has provided us with some of these attributes including: the ability to quickly create websites focused on particular geographic areas and categories; and to populate those websites with targeted content that we believe will be useful to both our core demographic and our advertisers. In December 2012, we announced the launch of certain vertical sites that focus on lead generation opportunities and expand our monetization methods and in January 2013, we announced the launch of the United Kingdom (“UK”) version of our flagship-site to expand the geographic footprint of our offering.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1365320818647</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 03:46:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365348339976-10</Id><Topic><Title>Jack Ma has one month to announce Alibaba IPO</Title><Username>turmaniloil</Username><Timestamp>1365111037768</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 17:30:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IPO noises will start to make louder now until they announce it.

It was just announced that there were 45 million online streams of the NCAA March Madness Basketball Tournament games so far this year, up 158% from last year, with 60% of them over mobile devices! CCUR will capitalize most on this! CCUR's MediaHawk delivers video in any format, to any screen, over any network, at any time. MediaHawk multi-screen technology is now powering the multi-screen service of Virgin Media (VMED) the largest cable TV company in the UK. CCUR is powering a similar multi-screen video service for the largest cable TV company in Japan! CCUR was the 1st company to introduce video on demand (VOD) technology 13 years ago and they currently hold a 30% market share of the VOD market with 212 VOD deployments across 4 continents, reaching a total of 50mm VOD homes! CCUR closed Friday at $7.24 per share with only 9.2mm shares outstanding and a market cap of $66.6mm with $24.6mm in cash, no debt, and an enterprise value of only $42mm or just 0.67X its revenue of $62.59mm! CCUR's EPS has been ramping up big on a quarter-to-quarter basis from $0.02 to $0.04 and to $0.08 the past 3 quarters. CCUR's main competitor Seachange (SEAC) is a money losing but is already trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.81, which would make CCUR a $15 per share stock!</Msg><Username>jtdmnf533</Username><Timestamp>1365349552735</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 11:45:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365358041417-13</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone's advice to buy Yahoo from $11 to $21 was spot on!</Title><Username>shelcorecrust</Username><Timestamp>1362511915833</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:31:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you really think that then that makes you the idiot (~~,</Msg><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1365358041417</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 14:07:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365360731801-14</Id><Topic><Title>Coldone's advice to buy Yahoo from $11 to $21 was spot on!</Title><Username>shelcorecrust</Username><Timestamp>1362511915833</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:31:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh yes Sherlock, clear as mud.
