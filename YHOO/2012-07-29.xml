China access is what Facebook and Google want. Yahoo is a very low hanging fruit with Yummy $2B in patents, $7 Billion Yahoo Japan, and $15 Billion Alibaba (Pre- IPO wholesale discounted value), also $Yahoo $2B cash and Yahoo franchise about $5 Billion. Total over $31 Billion If Google (why Marissa Mayor was hired for due diligence) and Facebook want to buy Yahoo and access patents and China via Alibaba, THE PREMIUM is another 40% over $31Billion sum-of-the parts valuation. Yahoo is worth at least $40Billion.</Msg><Username>brkout_volume_surge</Username><Timestamp>1343577734325</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 12:02:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343579033367-8</Id><Title>Hedgie Peter Schoenfeld says Yahoo! holds appeal</Title><Msg>Hedge-fund Peter Schoenfeld Asset Management oversees roughly $2B in assets. Its $1.4B PSAM WorldArb fund seeks to exploit pricing anomalies in securities of firms involved in corporate, tax, or regulatory events -- such as takeovers, bankruptcies, liquidations, and spinoffs.

I have gone back into a starter position in Yahoo! on the long side. The share price has gone nowhere since the high-profile CEO appointment and since hedgehogger Dan Loeb has acquired board representation. After following the companies for more than a decade, I know the values are there, and it seems to me that the company finally will press to realize them. I was hoping to pick up the shares below $15 in a correction, but I suspect that is unlikely. The coldone said to buy Yahoo under $15, Kass should have listened to the coldone. Everyone should have listened to the co!done when he said to buy at $11, $12, $13 and under $15.</Msg><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1343579979006</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 12:39:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343580090163-12</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa Mayer Gearing up for Mobile</Title><Username>mb525799</Username><Timestamp>1343543445577</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 02:30:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Henrique De Castro will replace Levinsohn.</Msg><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1343580090163</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-29 12:41:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343601509025-13</Id><Topic><Title>Still the best!!</Title><Username>coldonereign</Username><Timestamp>1317486645000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-10-01 12:30:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Still buying heavily while Yahoo jumps over $16 bringing my average down even further.

Friday Afternoon All-Hands! New Work Spaces! Fab Swag! Yahoo’s new CEO Marissa Mayer’s second week is showing even more signs of what the company will be like under her regime. In short: It will be just like Google, from whence she came. Praise be: Yahoogle lives! What will be more indicative will be to see who she will bring in to help her lead the company. Will it be big names like herself, or a less high-profile team? Of course, many at Yahoo are bracing for a pack of current and former Googlers — Mayer had a lot of loyal staffers, such as longtime online exec Ben Ling — to come on board. And, by the looks of all the Googley changes at Yahoo, they’ll feel right at home when they get there.
