The company is aiming for 3 trillion yuan ($473 billion) in annual transaction value from its Taobao e-commerce units in the next 5 to 7 years, Zeng Ming told reporters. "From their annual reports we did a rough calculation and we were similar last year but we are growing faster than them this year, so this year we are probably larger than them," Zeng said of Amazon and eBay, America's top online retailer and auction site. "The gap is just going to get bigger and bigger when we grow faster," he said.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1347078893661</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 00:34:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347099661049-2</Id><Topic><Title>China's Alibaba to pass Amazon, eBay in transaction value</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1347078893661</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 00:34:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Alibaba Group will IPO at RECORD $200 BILLION !!!</Msg><Username>leestoller</Username><Timestamp>1347099661049</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 06:21:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347099926939-3</Id><Title>China's Alibaba , Yahoo should keep 20%</Title><Msg>Yahoo should keep 20% of Alibaba.

YHOO bought $1BIL of stock in the past 4 quarters. In 18 years they'll wipe out entire float. Ownership of Alibaba is an enormous value. I believe it is worth around $25BIL - $30BIL. This is what Daniel Loeb is looking at as well. Y Japan is worth about $4BIL. Yahoo has these investments on books at $5.8BIL and cannot revalue them using GAAP. If I was Marissa, I would spin off these investments into Yahoo Investments company as a tax free spinoff to shareholders and Yahoo. With this approach Yahoo would get to value the investments at closing value (FMV) and the share price would rise to $35 - $40. Alibaba will become a huge competitor for Amazon in a few years and I believe it will be a premier merchant globally. Yahoo will need to work with Facebook to monetize Alibaba in USA/World and work on Mobile advertising and search. Yahoo represents value while Amazon represents momo cr@p.</Msg><Username>moneymeyka</Username><Timestamp>1347118624561</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 11:37:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347121724369-17</Id><Title>Alibaba raped yahoo shareholders</Title><Msg>Yahoo shareholders have been raped frequently by management.

And since this is Yahoo you can expect; In 2014 Yahoo sold Right Media for $75 million.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1347155582058</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 21:53:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347158948400-38</Id><Title>inside trading</Title><Msg>anybody notice the inside trading recently? looks like she is starting to sell some stock to pay for the new baby toys! with all her money why does she need to sell any shares unless for tax purposes. it will be interesting to follow her share sales since she doesn't have to buy any when the cos. history is to give them out for free to mgt.!</Msg><Username>matsky5</Username><Timestamp>1347158948400</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 22:49:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347159454546-39</Id><Topic><Title>inside trading</Title><Username>matsky5</Username><Timestamp>1347158948400</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 22:49:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i wonder what filo &amp; morse payed for their shares -if anything-since the two combined got about a cool 8,500,000! they are showing their confidence in mgt. or the overall company by selling at these prices!</Msg><Username>matsky5</Username><Timestamp>1347159454546</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 22:57:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
