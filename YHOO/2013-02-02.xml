He isn't going to want to panic anyone and cost himself money...lol He is gently reducing his position. If he was wildly optimistic on the stock from these levels he would not be selling. He still needs this stock to stay up high or risks his portfolio. I imagine he is rolling into GOOG and AIG.

In late 2006 and early 2007, we jointly explored a broad range of ways in which our two companies might work together. These discussions were based on a vision that the online businesses of Microsoft and Yahoo! should be aligned in some way to create a more effective competitor in the online marketplace. We discussed a number of alternatives ranging from commercial partnerships to a merger proposal, which you rejected. While a commercial partnership may have made sense at one time, Microsoft believes that the only alternative now is the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo! that we are proposing. In February 2007, I received a letter from your Chairman indicating the view of the Yahoo! Board that “now is not the right time from the perspective of our shareholders to enter into discussions regarding an acquisition transaction.” According to that letter, the principal reason for this view was the Yahoo! Board’s confidence in the “potential upside” if management successfully executed on a reformulated strategy based on certain operational initiatives, such as Project Panama, and a significant organizational realignment. A year has gone by, and the competitive situation has not improved.</Msg><Username>bhttsl</Username><Timestamp>1359844996531</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:43:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359849510315-52</Id><Title>If DELL is worth $24B , then how much is Yahoo worth ?</Title><Msg>Can anyone explain this value ?</Msg><Username>lyonsaudit</Username><Timestamp>1359849510315</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 18:58:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359850306743-53</Id><Topic><Title>If DELL is worth $24B , then how much is Yahoo worth ?</Title><Username>lyonsaudit</Username><Timestamp>1359849510315</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 18:58:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$ 48 billions or more!,, Whatever Didier you expect?</Msg><Username>franznummer1</Username><Timestamp>1359850306743</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 19:11:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359850433435-54</Id><Topic><Title>Apple/Microsoft Growth and Competitive Challenges</Title><Username>bhttsl</Username><Timestamp>1359844218505</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 17:30:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Best combine with Apple!</Msg><Username>franznummer1</Username><Timestamp>1359850433435</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 19:13:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359850489433-55</Id><Title>Yahoo please help prevent harassing re posting</Title><Msg>Please allow post creators the ability to decide how long their own posts stay up.

If Yahoo had 10 shares outstanding and you owned 6 of them knowing you had Yahoo willing to pay any price to buy them back are you going to sell or wait until it goes sky high? Now if he said it was to rebalance his portfolio that is fine but to say its cause of Yahoo's buyback is B.S. Don't you think you would have learned ANYTHING when volume sky-rocketed and Icahn gave Bartz a vote of confidence only to SELL out completely by that March, years ago. Excuses are like a'holes everyone has one! Dumping 11M shares is not "rebalancing"!

Yahoo will keep climbing as they buyback another $1.5B in stock this quarter." So Yahoo buys back about 6.5% of the outstanding shares and Third Point/Loeb cuts his stake by 15% and that somehow maintains his percentage stake in Yahoo adjusted for buybacks? Now perhaps he sold 15% in anticipation of the additional buybacks. However if that is the case, he must feel there is limited upside or he would have only sold 6%-7% now and more later as perhaps the price appreciated. To me, selling as much as he did tells me he think there is limited upside from here. Not that it is going down, but at a minimum, the upside is somewhat limited. One other thing to ponder, as a memeber of the Board of Directors, he would perhaps have knowledge of any pending partnerships, buyouts, deals, on and on. So if there was any big news coming anytime soon like so many on this board wish for, I think his action here put those to rest, at least for the time being. Remember, he didn't have to do anything if in fact news was coming. But the fact he sold 11 million shares I think lays to rest for a while the lilkeyhood of any major news coming. So all those posters on here on hopium expecting news any moment to send this stock higher, I think ThirdPoint/Loeb just tossed cold water on your dreams.
