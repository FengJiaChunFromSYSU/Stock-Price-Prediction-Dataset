They are looking for "elephants" - places where they can spend a lot of money at once. Unfortuately, Yahoo is not an elephant! With its revolving door for overpaid, ineffective executives; its high turnover - hands off Board of Directors; its dysfunctional policies regarding the various features; and its large number of free-loading users (like me) who never spend a dime on this site -- nobody will touch this company and certainly not at a price that some would like to think that Yahoo is worth. I am especially disappointed in the new Board that seems to be following the same ineffective policies of the people they replaced. Yahoo cannot be managed; it is just too late. It needs to be cut up and sold piece by piece. I don't see that happening any time soon.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1349198421375</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 13:20:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349198536189-31</Id><Topic><Title>Update on feedback and action taken by message board team</Title><Username>ugc.team</Username><Timestamp>1347022841028</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:00:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Easy and Fast Fix for These Boards , , GIVE US THE OLD ONES BACK !!!
