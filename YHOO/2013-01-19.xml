The guy took $1B and turned it into a $60B company with multi-billion dollar subsidiaries. Without him, Yahoo would be a PENNY stock, trading for under $5. You wouldn't have gotten $7B, $4.2B after-tax into Yahoo's coffers. With potentially another $10B after-tax coming. You say a LOT of dumb s*** but this clearly takes the cake. The guy is only 48 and I don't view him stepping down as a good thing regardless if it means an IPO happens soon. Do you know what is going to happen to his private investment vehicles once he cashes out of Alibaba and focuses on them? I'll put it in something you probably won't understand...him leaving is the equivalent of Steve Jobs being gone from Apple. Hell I believe the Times labeled him the Steve Jobs of the West.

The opposite as I couldn't stop laughing. It amazes me how people attack the guy who singlehandedly has kept this from being a penny stock. Over the years, I've seen it all and more often then not people don't give the guy much credit. People, especially Yahoo shareholders, should be thanking him. Bill Gates, is Chairman Emeritus, of MSFT and he hasn't did s*** for them in over a decade. He was Chief Software Officer, in the early 2000's but it hasn't been his focus for some time now. Whether Jack Ma cashes out really doesn't matter as my point is he's moved onto other endeavors particularly his cinema chain, Chinese medicine and his love for protecting the environment. As for Yang, he thought he could turn around Yahoo, he IS Yahoo, and he never had any other pursuit in life. For all intents purposes AG has been "public" for sometime just not to the little investor. Yes, I stand by this was the dumbest topic created and to say he is wise to step down in the face of all he did for AG is idiotic not even a defendable opinion. Tetherbird like its creator Coldone likes to say a LOT of stuff but doesn't even take the few seconds to consider how dumb it sounds.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1358579477272</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 02:11:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358579614064-4</Id><Topic><Title>Jack Ma is stepping down early for a reason</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1358556625154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 19:50:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For Alibaba to keep its momentum, the company will need focus—right at a time when Ma is showing signs of distraction. “I am going to enjoy some other things apart from business,” he says. Already one of China’s richest men, with a stake in Alibaba worth about $2.6 billion, Ma shows little interest in technology: He doesn’t spend much time online and depends on a colleague to help him download U.S. TV shows to his iPad. Instead, he dabbles in poker, traditional medicine, and other pastimes. He’s teamed up with movie star Jet Li to spread awareness of tai chi and is so into the ancient Chinese martial art that he brings along a personal trainer when he travels. Environmentalism is another pet cause. In 2010, Ma joined the global board of the Nature Conservancy. Says Orville Schell, a former dean of the journalism school at the University of California at Berkeley, and a close friend: “Business is not his first love.” Ma has been spending time in the Bay Area. He rents a home there, and he has audited history courses at Berkeley, where his son is an undergraduate. The time in the U.S. has clearly rubbed off on him. “I want people to learn what democracy means,” he says. One way to do that: The company’s 25,000 employees elect 10 representatives who determine how Alibaba spends part of its philanthropy budget. “This is the first test in China of a real democracy,” Ma says</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1358579614064</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 02:13:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358599063237-5</Id><Topic><Title>Jack Ma is stepping down early for a reason</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1358556625154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 19:50:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey #$%$...Without Yahoo! would not be Alibaba!! 2005 ... $1B ....

The agreement clearly states “Under the terms of the agreement with Yahoo!, Alibaba Group has the right to repurchase one-half of Yahoo!’s remaining stake upon a qualifying initial public offering in the future.” So the question is, would Alibaba rather repurchase this half of the remaining stake (let’s call it 10% of Alibaba) when Alibaba is valued at $60 billion or $80 billion? Although Alibaba would potentially be richer with a larger valuation, I assume they’d prefer to buy back that 10% stake at a lower valuation assuming that it will quickly appreciate in the coming years, as it has in recent years. 2. To end the IP Royalty Stream (the TIPLA clause in the agreement). The May agreement states: “Alibaba will make an upfront lump sum royalty payment of US$550 million to Yahoo! and continuing royalty payments for up to four years.” The key words there are “up to.” The sooner Alibaba buys out Yahoo, the sooner they can cease this IP royalty stream to them (or at least reduce it). 3. Pay down debt which they took on to buy back Yahoo’s first tranche. 4. Although Yahoo can keep its last 10% tranche in perpetuity, the sooner Alibaba IPOs, the sooner it would have more resources to potentially offer to buy back this last tranche in a block trade, thereby maximizing the rapid expected growth of Alibaba’s share value to management and employees. 5. The last round of investors in Alibaba might want to take advantage of the monetization opportunity from the IPO even, just as Facebook (FB) investors did. 6. Alibaba’s ambitions to expand outside China. Their investments in Auctiva and Vendio are viewed as unsuccessful despite both having significant installed user bases. Having the resources to launch a US-focused platform is something that should produce results as well as compete with eBay (EBAY) in their own backyard. 7. Talent retention. Start refuting. When you finish with these I'll give you the rest.</Msg><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1358620297675</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 13:31:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358621924200-24</Id><Topic><Title>May 10, 2013 is the date Jack Ma steps down at Alibaba Group</Title><Username>xisdamarkfonex</Username><Timestamp>1358608300644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 10:11:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Vision?

When people suggest buying Google, I look at the current price and PE, and then I look at Yahoo! It's not tough to decide Yahoo!, even at $20 a share, is a far better choice than Google or EBay. I also believe Alibaba will go public this year, and the money coming to Yahoo! will jump the stock $6 a share in the first week. Buy, buy, buy NOW! Earnings on the 28th will likewise jump the price by $5 a share.

Every IPO, has insiders offer 5-20% of the company or whatever at which point the overall company gets a valuation. Facebook got over $10B on a valuation of $100B when it IPO'd. The goal is always to sell as little equity as possible to the public. Makes sense if you think the company has huge upside as you want all of it. Now if you got insiders like Lefofsky(sp) of Groupon or Pincus of Zynga selling then you got a problem...guess what both imploded. Insider transactions is what everyone should watch. Yahoo had no insiders buy for years, the occasional 5,000 shares notwithstanding. Even now I think they're dumping their free options probably for tax purposes.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1358646857880</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:54:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358654257421-49</Id><Topic><Title>Jack Ma is stepping down early for a reason</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1358556625154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 19:50:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jack Ma will have much to say when he steps down in May.</Msg><Username>tornupdown</Username><Timestamp>1358654257421</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:57:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358654308330-50</Id><Topic><Title>May 10, 2013 is the date Jack Ma steps down at Alibaba Group</Title><Username>xisdamarkfonex</Username><Timestamp>1358608300644</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 10:11:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jack Ma will not be short on words when he steps down.</Msg><Username>tornupdown</Username><Timestamp>1358654308330</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:58:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
