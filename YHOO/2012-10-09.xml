This board use to be an exciting place as all the latest news was posted here with links to prove validity. Now, it is more like a gossip center with no credibility what so ever.

So let's begin by analyzing this statement. Arrogance? Won't even address that, just ridiculous. Freebies? The co. needs to get the atmosphere and motivation back you herb. Also, if you're long and don't have the patience to wait for the stock to pop $4 you should probably not be investing/trading.

On the issue of how many shares were bought with the "685M" downpayment on a stock buyback...I think we already have the answer. YHOO reported in mid July the repurchase of 40 million shares of their stock. I believe this is the stock YHOO is now calling the downpayment on Ma's cash. YHOO did not have Ma's money then and they are careful to call the funds spent...a down payment. I suspect YHOO recouped the 685M back to their treasury and now hold the 3B for distribution, or have in fact bought more stock under the current 5B authorized buyback using Ma's money..</Msg><Username>goldeagle14</Username><Timestamp>1349782843804</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 07:40:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349788101044-10</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo bracing for 5 billion dollar qaurter...</Title><Username>oldmaneddie81</Username><Timestamp>1349780768006</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 07:06:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another worthless post from Mr. Dementia...the only goof on this board who has yet to make a profitable trade.

The reasons are as below: 1. Under estimated asset value. After selling all of its holdings on Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, Yahoo would own up to $18B - $20B cash! That's the same as its current market capital. In other word, Yahoo is currently selling at cash level ($16/share and $19B). 2. Under estimated core business. Yahoo core business is generating around $1.3B positive cash flow every year for the past three years and the market is evaluating it at negative value. Yahoo search patents could worth billions and made Yahoo a potential buyout target for MSFT, Apple or others. 3. Under estimated EPS and P/E With the cash from selling Alibaba and Yahoo Japan and its operation, Yahoo could do massive buyback to buy back up to 80% of its current floating shares at current price($16), if Yahoo's profit remains unchanged during the buyback, Yahoo EPS could rise from the current $1 to $5, Yahoo share price could easily go to $30 level or even much higher. AOL is an example for Yahoo, both company had received billons from selling assets or patents and both company have a new CEO from Google. The difference is, AOL only received $1.1B cash from selling patents and yet Yahoo could receive up to $18B - $20B cash from selling its assets and patents. AOL price has been doubled since it issued a one time special dividend after receiving $1.1B from selling patents to MSFT. 4. Under estimated board and management Third Point has now become the largest shareholder and taken control of the board and the company lately and introduced a lot of good changes to the company especially the new CEO from Google - Marissa Mayer. Facebook hired Sheryl Sandberg from Google ten years ago and she helped Facebook to increase its revenue by more than ten times!!! Sheryl Sandberg was the VP of Google and was in charge of 4000 Google engineers. Marissa Mayer was also the VP of Google and was in charge of 3000 Google engineers. Apparently the market has under estimated the new board and the new management.</Msg><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1349795213977</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 11:06:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349795474421-51</Id><Topic><Title>When Coldone Comes Back Yahoo will Rocket</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1349794465395</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:54:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hi tethered (Coldone alias # 68)!

They are traders, pump and dump artists, and nothing they say can be trusted. None of them have been long-term holders, they are the ones that buy it at $15.75 and sell it at $16. Thousands of underperforming stocks do buybacks and their stock goes no where. Cisco did it for years, buying back shares, but then handing out millions of free stock options to the executives and employees. After the stock went no where, John Chambers finally and reluctantly paid a dividend. Like Yahoo, they don't see the retail shareholder as important, it' all about themselves.</Msg><Username>cjclink3</Username><Timestamp>1349804827295</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 13:47:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349804965361-75</Id><Topic><Title>Kara Swisher is a jerk and is losing her clout-she wrote last week in a week we would hear something on the 3 billion</Title><Username>delmundosoftball</Username><Timestamp>1349797957300</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 11:52:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, Kara does the best she can as Yahoo's 3rd party PR and IR person.

The problem with stock buybacks is if management is not executing or is doing senseless acquisitions as Yahoo has done in the past, any value that the shareholders might have gotten via a buyback would be lost.

Were it not for the Microsoft deal Yahoo would be selling assets to pay wages. Yahoo is in need of change.
