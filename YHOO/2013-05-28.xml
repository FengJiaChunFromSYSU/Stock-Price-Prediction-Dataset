Obama appointed Eric Holder will investigate himself. The Justice Department pledged Friday to to review its policies relating to the seizure of information from journalists after acknowledging that a controversial search warrant for a Fox News reporter’s private emails was approved “at the highest levels” of the Justice Department, including “discussions” with Attorney General Eric Holder. The statement, confirming an NBC News account of Holder’s role, defended the secret warrant to obtain reporter James Rosen’s emails as a legitimate step to obtain evidence as part of an investigation of Stephen Kim. Nevertheless, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, Holder “understands the concerns that have been raised by the media and has initiated a re-evaluation of existing department policies and procedures.” The official said the department must strike “the appropriate balance” between preventing leaks of classified information and “First Amendment rights,”adding that passage of a new media shield law “and appropriate updates to the department”s internal guidelines” will help achieve that. The statement comes amid a firestorm of criticism from news media groups over the Rosen search warrant and a secret subpoena for the phone records of AP reporter.

(Since Obama's 800 billion dollar stimulus was a complete failure since it had simply paid the mismanaged depeleted retirment funds of major unions) Where's Yahoo "News"'s outcry to obama to stop blocking the Keystone pipeline? So the US House did someting, and of course Yahoo "news" refuses to mention it because the news would be embarrassing to their beloved king Obama. Here's more about the Keystone pipeline... The US House pushed through a bill Wednesday to bypass the president to speed approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas. Democrats criticized the legislation as a blatant attempt to allow a foreign company to avoid environmental review. The bill was approved, 241-175, largely along party lines. Republicans said the measure was needed to ensure that the long-delayed pipeline, first proposed in 2008, is built. “This is the most studied pipeline in the history of mankind,” said Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., the bill’s sponsor.</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1369731549270</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 04:59:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369733999331-4</Id><Topic><Title>Us House passes bill to bypass Obama blocking of Keystone pipeline</Title><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1369731549270</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 04:59:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one will ever believe the grand old pharts party again..

By allowing pornography to remain on Tumblr's blogging platform, it appears that Yahoo is ostensibly condoning and endorsing this material as "it's just the nature of user-generated content". Not on a moral crusade here as adults should be free to make their own decisions. But Yahoo's leadership seem completely oblivious to some important issues. Pornography has a very deleterious effect on many individuals. Too many marriages and families have been broken apart because of men getting addicted to this stuff. Too many underage kids will get past whatever barriers there are and view this adult content. How much hidden damage is being done to these children who see these sex sites? Many parents have no clue that there kids are being exposed to this content. Why is Yahoo enabling this? And what about the young women who are being exploited? Many of these women are coaxed into this, or do it on a whim without thinking about the long term consequences. Some have drug and alcohol problems while others were sexually abused growing up. For many women, getting involved in porn causes or adds to their psychological troubles. How is facilitating young women to harm themselves in such a manner consistent with Yahoo's written code of ethics? Also, this notion of trying to be cool, hip, and edgy seems so forced. Porn ain't cool and never was. It hurts too many people. And putting nude photos of young women on the Internet without their knowledge or consent, which happens frequently, is about as low as it gets. Have we no standards? I would urge Yahoo shareholders, employees, and concerned parents to contact CEO Mayer and the Yahoo Board and request that the pornography and nudity be removed from Tumblr similar to the way Google has kept this type of content off of YouTube. And if this causes mass exodus from Tumblr, what does that say about the nature of the site anyway? Let's do it the right way Yahoo!</Msg><Username>j_r_mcdowell</Username><Timestamp>1369747468774</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 09:24:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369747750539-15</Id><Title>IPHONE 5s TO FEATURE DOUBLE THE RESOLUTION!!!!!!</Title><Msg>Wowowowow</Msg><Username>criticaltolerance</Username><Timestamp>1369747750539</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 09:29:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369749409369-16</Id><Topic><Title>Is Yahoo the New Purveyor of Porn?</Title><Username>j_r_mcdowell</Username><Timestamp>1369747468774</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 09:24:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I feel sorry for you, prude.

But for anyone who wants to understand Yahoo’s strategy—and “Web 3.0″ in general—it’s the company’s recent bid for video streaming site Hulu, reportedly worth $600-$800 million, that matters more. By buying Hulu, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is acknowledging that, contrary to the notion that the internet remains a hotbed of disruption, parts of it, at least, are quite a mature market. She’s hedging her bets: buying the daring, trendy startup, Tumblr, in the hope that it will turn into a money-spinner, but also a reliable cash cow, Hulu, to guarantee her conglomerate a steady stream of revenue. The best place for Hulu is inside a larger company, like Yahoo, which can integrate it with its other services. Yahoo already attracts 45 million unique visitors a month to its videos, according to comScore—one-third as many as Google/YouTube (though Yahoo’s users watch far less total video). Hulu has 24 million visitors. Facebook, for comparison, has 63 million video watchers, second only to Google. Putting Yahoo and Hulu together—even if their existing audiences overlap somewhat—makes them a contender for that number two spot.

Whether it is "right" or wrong has no place in investing (or speculating) Its only a question of whether it is a good move for Yahoo or not. Looks like the CEO is stuck with trying to broaden Yahoo's business with this site or wil have to change it and thereby kill its attraction for the young. The guy who runs Tumblr HATES advertising and promises not to change that and Yahoo is advertising dependent and promises not to interfere. Investors will not buy that conflict and will gradually erode the price of the stock by not buying.

McCarthy May 25, 2013 4:10 PM Comments65 Mark’s column this weekend is on the mulish and all too familiar refusal of the West (in this case, Britain) to grapple with the unyielding fact that barbaric attacks (in this case, the savage murder of Lee Rigby on Wellington Street in Woolwich) are driven by an ideology rooted in Islamic scripture. I discuss some of these scriptures, cited by Rigby’s brazen jihadist killers, in my own column about President Obama’s national security speech this week — particularly, about the president’s willful blindness to Islamic supremacist ideology. As part of his conclusion, Mark observes: One in ten Britons under 25 is now Muslim. That number will increase, through immigration, disparate birth rates, and conversions like those of the Woolwich killers, British-born and -bred. Metternich liked to say the Balkans began in the Landstrasse, in southeast Vienna. Today, the Dar al-Islam begins in Wellington Street, in southeast London. . . . Exactly right. It is worth emphasizing how this is happening. The West’s cravenness has invited an aggressive immigration strategy the Muslim Brotherhood and their fellow Islamic supremacists designed specifically for non-Islamic societies that won’t defend themselves (as in, have decided they are not worth defending). I described it in an essay on the Boston Marathon bombers — the Tsarnaev brothers – for the May 20 issue of NR: The strategy has been called “voluntary apartheid.” The idea is to provide Muslim immigrants in the West — particularly, energetic young Muslims like the Tsarnaevs — with cultural, psychological, and even physical insulation from Western mores, traditions, and institutions. It was the bedrock of Muslim Brotherhood founder Hassan al-Banna’s framework for ground-up revolution. In every city and town, the Egyptian academic taught, Muslim leaders must establish a mosque-cum-community center. These, he explained, would become “the axis of our movement,” serving as the “House of Dawa” — that is, of Islam’s particularly aggressive form of proselytism — and providing “the base for our rise . . . to educate us, prepare us, and supply our battalions.” It is working. A friend reminds me of an excellent analysis of “no-go zones” across Europe by Soeren Kern for the Gatestone Institute. Here’s the part about Britain (and note that it was written almost two years ago — and the strategy has only picked up steam since then): Islamic extremists are stepping up the creation of “no-go” areas in European cities that are off-limits to non-Muslims. Many of the “no-go” zones function as microstates governed by Islamic Sharia law. Host-country authorities effectively have lost control in these areas and in many instances are unable to provide even basic public aid such as police, fire fighting and ambulance services. The “no-go” areas are the by-product of decades of multicultural policies that have encouraged Muslim immigrants to create parallel societies and remain segregated rather than become integrated into their European host nations. In Britain, for example, a Muslim group called Muslims Against the Crusades has launched a campaign to turn twelve British cities – including what it calls “Londonistan” – into independent Islamic states. The so-called Islamic Emirates would function as autonomous enclaves ruled by Islamic Sharia law and operate entirely outside British jurisprudence. The Islamic Emirates Project names the British cities of Birmingham, Bradford, Derby, Dewsbury, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Luton, Manchester, Sheffield, as well as Waltham Forest in northeast London and Tower Hamlets in East London as territories to be targeted for blanket Sharia rule. In the Tower Hamlets area of East London (also known as the Islamic Republic of Tower Hamlets), for example, extremist Muslim preachers, called the Tower Hamlets Taliban, regularly issue death threats to women who refuse to wear Islamic veils. Neighborhood streets have been plastered with posters declaring “You are entering a Sharia controlled zone: Islamic rules enforced.” And street advertising deemed offensive to Muslims is regularly vandalized or blacked out with spray paint. In the Bury Park area of Luton, Muslims have been accused of “ethnic cleansing” by harassing non-Muslims to the point that many of them move out of Muslim neighborhoods. In the West Midlands, two Christian preachers have been accused of “hate crimes” for handing out gospel leaflets in a predominantly Muslim area of Birmingham. In Leytonstone in east London, the Muslim extremist Abu Izzadeen heckled the former Home Secretary John Reid by saying: “How dare you come to a Muslim area.” These enclaves are not just swelling concentrations of resistance to assimilation. They help fortify the resolve of the “battalions” of violent jihadists.</Msg><Username>pebble.ubetcha</Username><Timestamp>1369777037194</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 17:37:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369777196718-50</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba thinking listing solely in HK.</Title><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1369760224456</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 12:57:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ma, the former CEO of Alibaba Group?

Alibaba Group Starts Work On Massive Logistics Network To Provide 24-Hour Deliveries Throughout China Alibaba Group officially launched (link via Google Translate) the China Smart Logistics Network (CSN) today, which former Alibaba CEO Jack Ma says will become the backbone of the country’s $190 billion e-commerce market. The network, which will be able to deliver shipments to any city in China within 24 hours, is backed by 100 billion yuan (about $16.3 billion) in funding and slated for completion in 8 to 10 years. Though Jack Ma retired as CEO of Alibaba Group on May 10, he has signed on as chairman of CSN and is among a group of investors participating in the network’s first phase of investment. Other backers include Forsun and Yintai. A stronger logistics network is crucial for China’s e-commerce economy because 70% of its current logistics warehouse infrastructure was built before the 1990s and cannot keep up with the speed and volume of current online transactions. CSN will provide third-party couriers, warehouses, shipping and other services, as well as analytics to help vendors improve shipment speed and reduce costs. Once finished, CSN will support 30 billion yuan (about $4.9 billion) in daily online sales, says the Alibaba Group. That represents a boon for online vendors in China, including those who use Taobao and Tmall, the company’s shopping sites. Last year, annual sales volume on Taobao and Tmall surpassed a combined 1 trillion yuan (about $157 billion) for the first time. If CSN hits its target of supporting daily sales of 30 billion yuan, that could potentially translate into annual revenue of about 10 trillion yuan per year.</Msg><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1369783436577</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 19:23:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369784587269-64</Id><Topic><Title>Where is Yahoo News on Islamic Terrorist in London?</Title><Username>jvg_mom</Username><Timestamp>1369431982157</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 17:46:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo news has been stuck up Obama's a(ss) since 2008, Yahoo does not do news .
