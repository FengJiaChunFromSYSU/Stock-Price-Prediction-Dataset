A majority of users on Local Corps flagship-site are females, aged between 25 and 45, with at least one child at home (the so-called “soccer moms”), a demographic that is deemed by many to be highly desirable because they generally have responsibility for 89% of bank accounts, 80% of healthcare decisions, and 50% of do-it-yourself projects and consumer product purchases. We designed the utility of our website to appeal to this group of targeted users.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1369656883250</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 08:14:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369669544880-4</Id><Topic><Title>"Yahoo’s Bid for Hulu in $600M to $800M Range — Even as It Preps Other Big Deals in Mobile and Communications"</Title><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1369597526620</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 15:45:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To me this seems to be a four corner game. Yahoo in one corner. Chernin in the opposite corner. DirecTV taking a third corner and Guggenheim Partners, where former Yahoo Ross Levinsohn is CEO of Digital Media which just bought #$%$ Clark Productions and owns the Hollywood Reporter, completing the square. What a lovely fight this is going to be.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1369669544880</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 11:45:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369671275172-5</Id><Topic><Title>"Yahoo’s Bid for Hulu in $600M to $800M Range — Even as It Preps Other Big Deals in Mobile and Communications"</Title><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1369597526620</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 15:45:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes exactly.

YHOO can enhance HULU while Chernin does not . YHOO got most extensive contents so DIS and NWS will go for YHOO. They will probably leave some investment money to YHOO because they know HULU will be in good hands.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1369679817918</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 14:36:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369680986042-8</Id><Topic><Title>"Yahoo’s Bid for Hulu in $600M to $800M Range — Even as It Preps Other Big Deals in Mobile and Communications"</Title><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1369597526620</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 15:45:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, was thinking this week-end that Yahoo! is in the best position of this group.
