Even at $20 it would still bring in 5%. Dividend buying funds and anyone with logic would buy this stock. This is much better than a one time dividend where afterwords an exodus from the stockwould happen. It would also buy at least 2 years time before a decision on other cash (dividend) can be dealt with.</Msg><Username>jx1960</Username><Timestamp>1347023861435</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 09:17:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347023871780-7</Id><Title>MISSED THE RALLY!</Title><Msg>Stock wont budge Jerry gone BOD gone Scott Gone New CEO - does she care about the stock price?

I think serial spamming, while not only destructive in itself, is also a symptom of employees, managers, directors and an outside CPA (PricewaterhouseCoopers) many of whom have very little idea of what integrity should look like in a company. Do you remember Mayor Guiliani's comment about turnstyle jumpers? Their attitude should be - if you steal from us, our paying advertisers or our users, we will shut you down. Period. Not eventually. Not when we get our software working. But now. But when you have a CPA that doesn't post an email address or a hot line and a board secy's office that doesn't forward messages to directors and a customer care department that frequently doesn't seem to, this is what you get. There is probably a better way to stop these spammers, but eliminating links is probably the easiest and lowest tech.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1347034341012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:12:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347036586531-35</Id><Topic><Title>To whom it may concern.</Title><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1276031248000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2010-06-08 17:07:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hottie, are you holding classes now?

Zero tolerance for small crimes works all the way up the chain. The serial spammers are still active. Still posting their scams but with copy-paste URL's which most people won't bother with. Also bumping their posts with the unlimited ID"s they get from Yahoo. So they haven't gone away. Yahoo hasn't gotten rid of them or their web sites. As a shareholder, I don't feel that these spammers belong on Yahoo. Anywhere. Can you imagine them on Microsoft; or Amazon; or Google; or any other legitimate company. Can you imagine any industry or business allowing some trying to rob their customers to set up shop in their physical or web space? It is amazing that the Yahoo "suits" don't even notice or don't care that someone is running a 3 card monte scheme on their property! I agree that a high tech company would find a better way. But Yahoo is not really a high tech company any more; it is an average-tech company that is slowly declining. Picture a store prone to shoplifters. Instead of keeping them out at the entrance, the company has put in a very small exit door so that they can't take out any merchandise.

That’s just how this stock behaves. Up and down up and down up and down. Learn to live with it, prepare for it and profit from it. If you are not married to this stock you are in this to make money. Make money when the stock moves up, it always does, and when the stock moves down, it always does.</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1347065637768</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 20:53:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347066206621-75</Id><Topic><Title>closing price 14 Sep</Title><Username>goldeagle14</Username><Timestamp>1347064954809</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 20:42:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey man I am with you.
