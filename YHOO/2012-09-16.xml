I was relieved when I saw Loeb add additional investment into YHOO but then I wondered what the real reason was.

Not yet priced in. Jack Ma will pay $7.6 Billion to Yahoo sometime this week or this month.(The Street has not priced in Jack Ma's "intention" as a realistic event.... they don't trust Ma) The tax liability assumption is 40% with no mention of tax offset. We all know Yahoo has written off a lot of assets last 2 years. CFO Morse was tasked with tax planning. Lets say there is at least $1 Billion charge off on the books, then the taxable amount for tax calc is reduced to $6.6 Billion. I think Jack Ma is packaging some other non-cash assets as part of payment which we will find out in a few days, which is probably another $2 Billion of non-cash + non-taxable transaction. The taxable amount is now down to $4.6 billions. You never can count on Jack Ma to do what he said. The taxable amount needs to deduct the tax base of the 40% Alibaba stocks, which Jerry Yang with his infinite wisdom paid $1 Billion + transaction costs, applying only selling half back to Jack Ma = $500 M+ in tax base deduction. So the taxable gain is at $4 Billion. @ 40% tax rate = $1.6 Billion vs the $3.1 Billion (40% of $7.6 Billion proceed) that has been assumed by most. A tax saving of $1.5 Billion could be realistic. Now the non-cash asset pkg (I estimate $2 Billion) by Ma could be given to Marissa as currency to buy companies. Marissa said she needs part of the proceed to acquire other assets, NOT ALL $7.6 Billion.</Msg><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1347852059837</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 23:20:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
