Now that the feds dropped the charges against sheriff Joe, Yahoo is completely silent. Yahoo is incredibly dishonest and will never make it in the news business. MSNBCNews article on Sept 2 reads - The federal government has closed a criminal probe of alleged financial misconduct by Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio, who styles himself as "America's toughest sheriff," and no charges will be filed, the U.S. Attorney's Office said on Friday. The announcement on Friday marked the end of an investigation that began in November 2010 at the behest of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to examine alleged financial improprieties by the county sheriff and his deputies. A federal criminal inquiry into several of those matters was concluded last summer with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona declining to initiate criminal charges. Maricopa County authorities were informed on Friday that federal prosecutors had likewise declined to bring charges in connection with allegations that the sheriff's office had misused county credit cards or misspent money from jail facilities excise taxes. Arpaio, 80, who is seeking re-election to a sixth term as sheriff in November, has been under a separate federal inquiry since 2008 over allegations that he and his deputies engaged in an extensive pattern of civil rights abuses.</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1346577413914</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 05:16:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346578034948-4</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Closing in on Yahoo Japan Sale</Title><Username>cul8eral</Username><Timestamp>1344615298758</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 12:14:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cul8eral, will yahoo investors see any of that $4.5 billion in form of a common stock dividend?

Yahoo had an article saying more on the subject on August 31st a couple of days before the material you posted from MSNBC!!!. Which do you hate more, Obama, Yahoo, or integrity? I know your post was only political rhetoric not worthy of any reply; but, I am tired of political mud slinging based on false statements and think that your effort to mix Yahoo and politics is more than a bit odd. If you want to vote for Romney do so but post your politics on a political web site not a financial/corporation message board.</Msg><Username>firsttestcase</Username><Timestamp>1346596000069</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 10:26:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346597471389-8</Id><Topic><Title>Yhoo is like free shopper pitched in a drive way FULL OF CLUTTER Crap ads everywhere U R A DINOSAUR</Title><Username>no.poverty</Username><Timestamp>1346595051404</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 10:10:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like your comparison. Yahoo doesn't seem to have a strategy to make money. Their news pampers Obama while at the same time bashes republicans. Yahoo does not pay a dividend to common shareholders so we would expect the money they make to grow the company. No, the money is wasted on this far-left biased news service which helps the democrats while Yahoo investors get nothing to show for their money.</Msg><Username>gkcreamcheese</Username><Timestamp>1346597471389</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 10:51:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346598425816-9</Id><Topic><Title>Feds quietly drop all charges against Sheriff Joe</Title><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1346577413914</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 05:16:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I found it and its dated Sept 1. Close enough. I do not recall seeing this posted on Yahoo's homepage yesterday but I did see some story about people being rude to Obama. I guess that was more important to Yahoo than apoligizing for what it said about sheriff Joe in some commentary which I think is what fishman is talking about. These so called new and improved yahoo message boards won't let us post links so we can't share links with each other.

If this is the case the shareholder, the companies actual owners, are simply buying shares to have their value go toward operating costs with no return???????
