Facebook came into my work and ran a Facebook Poker Tournament several times before the IPO, they did this to up the numbers of people that they say use Facebook, but most of the people just did it to get into the Tournament and never use the internet. That is important because how companies make money from ad's is to say {we have 100 million or so registered users} advertisers go with that number, then they pay money to get their product out hoping that they will get a % of the total number of registered users. I think it won't be long before you see Yhoo Commercials like the one's from Bing on TV trying to up the number, remember the YHOOOO commercials in the 90's, they worked well.</Msg><Username>timsinthewell</Username><Timestamp>1368763529917</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 00:05:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368767218706-2</Id><Topic><Title>GOOG up more today than YHOO is even worth...LMFAO!!!</Title><Username>dickey_betts44</Username><Timestamp>1368671307057</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 22:28:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well this time my post was followed by a 3% shellacking on higher than normal volume.

Obama is the real problem behind it all such as refusing to protect the US ambassador Benghazi, IRS targetting polical groups, AP phone record scandal. While yahoo news talks about OJ simpson, here's what ABC news says about Sara: Sarah Hall Ingram served as commissioner of the office responsible for tax-exempt organizations between 2009 and 2012. But Ingram has since left that part of the IRS and is now the director of the IRS’ Affordable Care Act office, the IRS confirmed to ABC News today. Her successor, Joseph Grant, is taking the fall for misdeeds at the scandal-plagued unit between 2010 and 2012. During at least part of that time, Grant served as deputy commissioner of the tax-exempt unit. Grant announced today that he would retire June 3, despite being appointed as commissioner of the tax-exempt office May 8, a week ago. As the House voted to fully repeal the Affordable Care Act Thursday evening, House Speaker John Boehner expressed “serious concerns” that the IRS is empowered as the law’s chief enforcer. “Fully repealing ObamaCare will help us build a stronger, healthier economy, and will clear the way for patient-centered reforms that lower health care costs and protect jobs,” Boehner, R-Ohio, said. “Obamacare empowers the agency that just violated the public’s trust by secretly targeting conservative groups,” Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., added. “Even by Washington’s standards, that’s unacceptable.”</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1368788055335</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 06:54:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368788793678-8</Id><Title>Hillary on dead US Ambassador in Benghazi -what difference does it make?</Title><Msg>After being pressed by senators including Ron Johnson to explain how it was that over the course of weeks, the Obama Administration stood by an absurd story claiming that four Americans were murdered in Libya due to a spontaneous protest gone bad, outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton played the indignation card. Because she obviously had no answer to justify the ongoing White House deception, Secretary Clinton chose theatrics over a straight answer and clarity: "What difference at this point does it make?!" she howled. What difference does ot make that 4 Americans are dead from Obama and Hillary. What difference does it make that the White House lied to us and tried to cover it up. What a pathetic excuse for a human being. If there was no wrongdoing, then why did Hillary immediately step down from being US Secretary of State? Who should be going to jail for this scandal?

The records obtained by the Justice Department listed outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, for general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and for the main number for the AP in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. It was not clear if the records also included incoming calls or the duration of the calls. In all, the government seized the records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown, but more than 100 journalists work in the offices where phone records were targeted, on a wide array of stories about government and other matters.</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1368789361249</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 07:16:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368789971016-10</Id><Title>Nutcase fishnman is out of his cage this morning.

This means 67 cents out of every dollar they take in goes straight to the bottom line. This is very impressive. The stock's forward P/E ratio is in line at 17.41. Finally, ROE is strong at 30%. These are solid fundamental statistics.</Msg><Username>turmaniloil</Username><Timestamp>1368802055956</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 10:47:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368802164767-37</Id><Title>Catalysts For Upside at Yahoo</Title><Msg>Yahoo has several positive catalysts ahead. New Content Deals Yahoo recently announced an SNL deal along with many new content agreements. COO Henrique De Castro describes Yahoo's ad pitch during upfront season as, "Content at scale on the web, delivered in a personalized way." Updated Apps Another positive is Yahoo's new iPhone Weather app has topped iOS weather app charts. Dan Frommer recently stated, "I've seen more normal people talking about it in a good way than any app in a long time." Furthermore, an Android version of Yahoo's revamped flagship app is now out. These are all very positive developments for Yahoo going forward. Yahoo Targeting Younger Demographic CFO Ken Goldman said at the JPMorgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom conference in Boston on Tuesday, "Yahoo plans to ramp up advertising and marketing efforts as it seeks to break its reliance on an 'aging demographic' and become more relevant among young adults. Part of it is going to be just visibility again in making ourselves cool, which we got away from for a couple of years." He went on to say Yahoo's brand will be more visible on outdoor billboards and at sporting events. The company is pursuing the 18-to-34 demographic. I see these developments as huge positives for the stock. These new opportunities may be what provides the next leg up for the stock.</Msg><Username>turmaniloil</Username><Timestamp>1368802164767</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 10:49:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368802495585-38</Id><Topic><Title>Hotmodel - Do you still think Yahoo was dead money at $15.80?</Title><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1367590931499</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 10:22:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hotmodel has been the most vocal against coldone's buys from $11 to $22.70.

As for the loser part??? I did help a poster on this board make $50K in Yahoo in his last 2 trades after teaching him options. He's the one who bought 80,000 contracts and 63,500 contracts respectively. Part of the email: I checked my "Sent" folder and it wasn't there, so I'm writing you again. The last time we spoke you said: "Nothing like making the average persons yearly income in but one trade!" How about making it in one day!? Pic attached. ;) As you can see, I originally intended it to be a long-term position. ($32 Jan 14 Call). But it spiked, so I sold. :P What a rush.

It's far more than just the powerful Alibaba IPO which will blow through $100B, and the growth that Marissa Mayer will be able to drive more and more as she turns the ship with new advertising revenue through mobilizing Yahoo, or the content monetizing that is such an obvious revenue source, or the fact that even "search" has turned around, but then there is the inevitable bidding war that is going to take place over Yahoo whether Dan Loeb and Marissa Mayer want it or not, it will happen. Those who get on board now will make a lot of money; those who wait will kick themselves for it for years. Carpe Diem!

You called me a cat lady passive-aggressive &amp; lonely first Hugh - you were the one last year - when I allowed to yell at me way too many times - or do you forget that - that told me you get what you give. So when you attack me I attack back...for the longest time on this board I allowed many of you to attack &amp; said very little. So out of the blue in the Fall - COLD &amp; the gang started to attack me _ and you are trying to tell me that is not suspcious. I think it is. Maybe you can't go back and see many of your posts from this time last year - but I can. Funny that cold &amp; the gang never once interrupted you or jangles or mb or grey when we were going back &amp; forth. I'm sorry - but I will use my limited intellegence to say that was very odd. It is not a lie &amp; you yourself admitted that - i'll find the post if you like. You laughed &amp; said we'll keep that between us. Listen, I have no beef with you, but I am being pushed off the board for a reason - &amp; we both know why. I will not be bullied into anything. Because I am an independent person, I will make the decision when &amp; if I leave here. Wow, a condescending #$%$...uh ... sorry ...no.. I can't accept that description of me.

I think it will take some time to merge Tumblr with Yahoo! From what I am reading Karp had to be convinced to hitch his baby to Yahoo! - I think he would have had an issue with any larger corp buying into his co. Once again though I think it's a testament to Mayer that this deal is happening at all. A few weeks back Tumblr let go of several editors they had hired only last year. It was an experiment they were trying called Storyboard. I wonder if this was in the works at that time. Anyway at that time they floated the idea that Karp very much needed his "sheryl sandberg" I would say he has that in Mayer, albeit in a slightly different way.</Msg><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1368838627985</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 20:57:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368838679555-238</Id><Topic><Title>Changing The Game..</Title><Username>warnerlambert</Username><Timestamp>1368831909574</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 19:05:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the negotiation phase is pretty much done.
