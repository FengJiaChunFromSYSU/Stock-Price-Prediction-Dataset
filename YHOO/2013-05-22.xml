Citing unnamed sources familiar with Apple's plans, 9to5Mac claims that users will be able to sign into their Flickr and Vimeo accounts through iOS 7's settings menus — much in the way you can integrate Facebook and Twitter accounts right now. Additionally, it is likely that third-party apps will be able to access Flickr and Vimeo services using the native integration with iOS. Earlier reports have claimed that Apple and Yahoo (owner of Flickr) have been in talks to develop a deeper partnership for iOS 7.</Msg><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1369199856858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 01:17:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369203588444-3</Id><Title>Name person who destroyed flicker!</Title><Msg>Please disclose the name of the person or persons who make the decision to change and destory flickr.

Then Yahoo made a deal with AT&amp;T and suddenly the news pages became very huge and PAINFULLY SLOW TO VIEW. I couldn't find any way to complain to Yahoo. So I left. Years gone by and Yahoo went to hell. Others like Google and Apple replaced Yahoo. Now flickr is shot through the heart and may be left for dead - unless they can reverse the "change" made to flickr a day or so ago. I'm very doubtful the change will be reverse because some big wheels probably shorted Yahoo stock to make money off the damages.</Msg><Username>sugarisaddictive</Username><Timestamp>1369204446981</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 02:34:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369208888693-5</Id><Topic><Title>Flickr Update!</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1369188671138</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 22:11:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your comment is oozing stink.

The Obama Justice Department has seized the phone records of numbers that are associated with White House staffers and with Fox News reporters in the case of Stephen Jin-Woo Kim, a former State Department contractor. He is accused of violating the Espionage Act for allegedly leaking classified information to reporter James Rosen. Yesterday, the Washington Post reported that, as part of the investigation of the Kim leak, Obama’s Department of Justice seized e-mails from Rosen’s personal Gmail account. In the search warrant for that request, the government falsely claimed Rosen as a co-conspirator” in violating the Espionage Act, noting that the crime can be punished by ten years in prison. Rosen was not indicted in the case, but the suggestion in a government document that a reporter could be guilty of espionage for engaging in routine reporting is unprecedented and has alarmed many journalists and civil libertarians. The Obama government intrusions have taken place after media reporting of the recent scandals revealed withing the Obama Administration including the IRS, Homeland Security, and the Dept of Justice. The magnitude of the government scandals exceed anything we have ever seen in history including the Nixon Administration are according to many in the media who are now being intimidated for simply reporting the news.</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1369218587980</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 06:29:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369225901383-11</Id><Title>Very funny Yahoo buying Tumblr for 1.1 billion!</Title><Msg>Don't understand how they can buy a company that is worth 14 million in annual revenue.

I think that this is one situation where the stock chart probably isn't lying, and good things are probably happening behind the scenes. (Note how wonderful the secrecy of the Tumblr negotiations was. Such secrecy is attractive to future deal discussions with other companies.) Thus my point of view is to accentuate the positive here, and I actually bought more YHOO Monday, having also added to my position late Friday when the Tumblr rumors surfaced. What's been done wrong with Yahoo! is in the past, just as it was in the past with Disney, IBM and Apple when the right CEO took the helm. It takes a while for memories of a company's difficult period to fade, and I look at that phenomenon as a rationale for why YHOO may remain undervalued from a risk-reward standpoint (thus I clearly don't think that YHOO is subject to the efficient market hypothesis). One of the highest flyers of the Internet bubble just might be blasting off again. If so, how high is up? Answer: Perhaps very high. And if I'm disappointed and really good things don't happen operationally, I expect Yahoo! to be in play. In a picked-over stock market, YHOO offers an unusual combination of long-term upside potential with downside protection.

If you uploaded thousands of pictures and made hundreds of flickr friends; you are left stranded by the tsunami that just hit a day or so ago. Maybe you can start over at ipernity. Ipernity is a lot like flickr used to be. If you are a flickr or yahoo employee your future is in doubt. About 10 years ago Yahoo made changes to it's news service, making the pages extremely painfully slow to view. In the years since Yahoo changed, Google and iPhone and many others grew as Yahoo rotted away. Now a few execs and their friends are making money off of destorying Flickr, destroying what's left of Yahoo and probably to destroy Tumbler as well.</Msg><Username>sugarisaddictive</Username><Timestamp>1369231184927</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:59:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369231477878-18</Id><Title>Yahoo!, PT raised from $27.00 to $30.00 at Oppenheimer.</Title><Msg>In a report published Tuesday, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein reiterated an Outperform rating on Yahoo!, and raised the price target from $27.00 to $30.00. In the report, Oppenheimer noted, “Following better than expected 4Q Alibaba results, a 12-month extension of the MSFT Search Guarantee and the Tumblr acquisition, we are increasing our price target on Yahoo! to $30 from $27. We now estimate Alibaba's value at $72B and are removing the 14% time value discount, consistent with press reports of Alibaba moving towards an IPO in 2014. Increasing 2013E EBITDA by 3% to reflect the MSFT RPS extension disclosed in YHOO's Form 10-Q. Lastly, while the Tumbler acquisition is estimated at 10x 2013E sales, at the high end of internet valuations, we see this as a conservative attempt by YHOO to strengthen its mobile and social capabilities, while adding more younger users to its platform.”</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1369231477878</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:04:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369231580435-19</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo!, PT raised from $27.00 to $30.00 at Oppenheimer.</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1369231477878</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:04:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you Toad.

After over an hour with AT&amp;T support, during which they remotely controlled my computer, they determined the problem was Yahoos. And, by the way, a friend of mine with the same service and a MAC is also experiencing the exact same problem. Well, that is when I found out that Yahoo support is nonexistent. I posted 3 different requests for support on their website [they don't provide a phone method] and got zero response. It has been over a week. I finally got a Google account and was able to send attachments with ease. So my conclusion is that Yahoo has serious support problems as well as software issues and isn't getting a dime of my money.</Msg><Username>elainesn</Username><Timestamp>1369239791457</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 12:23:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369239868296-39</Id><Title>Zagg stock breaking up fast $8soon</Title><Msg>New key board h20 for apple short naked running out.</Msg><Username>dariodbest</Username><Timestamp>1369239868296</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 12:24:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369240317119-40</Id><Topic><Title>I was all set to invest in YHOO since it seems to be on the go, when</Title><Username>elainesn</Username><Timestamp>1369239791457</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 12:23:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you type very smart too... this O'fart had to get me one of them there Samsung Google Chromebooks in order to get all them there bugs and worms out of my simple life here in Possum Hollow...
