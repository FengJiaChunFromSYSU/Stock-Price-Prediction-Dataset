Everytime there is a round of funding, whether a private round or public round, there is dilution and proceeds go to the company and/or selling shareholders. The purpose of an IPO is to raise working capital for the company. You really should know this. The fact that you are trying to state that Alibaba will not get any money from this IPO is silly. Please stop.</Msg><Username>lutts</Username><Timestamp>1361191701833</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 07:48:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361195892070-5</Id><Topic><Title>ALIBABA will IPO because...</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1361135405279</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 16:10:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gloom, you failed to mention the 20% of AG that was bought from YHOO, those shares will be in an IPO and proceeds will go to AG corp kitty, AG can also sell shares in the IPO that are authorized but not issued with those proceeds going to AG corp kitty. Ag also has a call on at least half of YHOO's remaining shares, but YHOO will receive the IPO price for these shares. YHOO will, after an IPO, to my recollection have about 10% of the then outstanding AG stock. It is this block that will provide the real gains for YHOO, if the IPO is successful. Fools with misinformation, ie webdave should understand what they write about before looking so dumb. You are far to intelligent to (from your past posts) to be so barish on YHOO. I trade it from both sides, and the side to be on right now is the short side. Until there is real progress on the books instead of just a lot of expensive take over hires, YHOO will trade flat to down and react to market rumors of AG IPO or YJ sell. YHOO does not need cash, so why sell anything? Flat to down with a bottom near 19.75.</Msg><Username>goldeagle14</Username><Timestamp>1361195892070</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 08:58:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361197318550-6</Id><Topic><Title>ALIBABA will IPO because...</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1361135405279</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 16:10:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, just like when Yahoo buys back stock the stocks cease to exist.

If you followed the "Black Friday" brouhaha, from a few months ago, you'll know they're on pace to make $1B in net income. $2.4B+ and $3.3B, according to Eric Jackson, in the next 2yrs. You shoot yourself in the foot by saying Yahoo's stake would be worth $75B in 2015. Yahoo will have only 10% at that point which would make AG worth $750B. That $700M is 1/10th of 1%. On a $1,000 that is a $1...wow. As for the discussion below, Gloom is correct in that its from current shareholders. Your mention of buying from shareholders then re-sell them to the public to keep the money doesn't make much sense. What idiot would sell their shares back to the company at a price LOWER than what they would get in the IPO? The only way that scenario works to add money to the treasury is if they do that. What companies DO though to add money is ISSUE NEW shares to dilute the current shareholders. here: Facebook is increasing the number of shares it will sell in its initial public offering, which could give it the record for amount raised in a U.S. IPO. Facebook will issue an additional 85 million shares this week, pushing the total number of shares available higher than 420 million. The world's most popular social network raised its proposed price for the shares to as high as $38 in a Tuesday morning filing; if Facebook sells all the shares at that price, it would reap more than $16 billion. Facebook's valuation at the time of its IPO could increase as well, if it issues additional shares instead of having existing shareholders sell more. In its most recent filing, Facebook said it intends to sell 180 million shares in the company, with early investors and insiders such as CEO Mark Zuckerberg and venture capitalist Peter Thiel selling more than 157 million.

This method provides capital for various corporate purposes through the issuance of equity without incurring any debt.

Do you think FB would continue to have that PE or it will contract like it has with Apple now that their growth and margins are gone? I'll correct you since FB paid BILLIONS for their IPO and the taxes of their employee's its quite skewed. Their forward PE is 36(as Eric Jackson alluded to last week). You don't honestly believe someone would pay 1800 times earnings do you?lol 1. If a company earned a dollar you'd be paying $1800 per share and unless you're going to live 2000 years you won't make it up...a bubble. 2. There is a thing called law of diminishing returns that as a company grows larger it becomes mathematically harder to sustain growth. 50% return on a $1 is far easier than 50% return on a trillion. Facebook ISN'T growing as its peaked after 8yrs thus the new revenue streams. Apple hasn't grown YOY thus the stock has fallen from $700 down to the $450's and it too needs a blockbuster thus the Apple Watch and TV. Yahoo is SELLING THEIR 10% STAKE AT IPO...too dumb to know that? If AG was worth $400B don't you think they would have bought out Yahoo last year. Why give Yahoo $80B when it could have been had for $30B or less? I really hope you have zero money in the market cause you'd most certainly lose it all with comments like that. You should have replied with your Brainless ID as that would be more appropriate!hahahahahahahaha Even though AG is 10yrs old which makes monster growth difficult...I'll show you! Let's say they grow 100% per year! YR1(2012): 1B net income YR2: 2B YR3: 4B YR4: 8B: YR5: 16B YR6: 32B and that STILL gives it a PE of 23.4 for your $750B from this morning. How many companies have you seen grow 100% per year for 6yrs after being around for 10??? Apple which has had the best run of any company possible didn't even do that and they launched the Iphone and Ipad. Apple in the last 20 quarters has been over 80% 3X's, not once hitting 100%. The other 17 quarters are between 20-70% growth with 1 negative quarter in Sept. 09. AG would never hit $400B with that growth. Even $100B would be a feat as neither Tencent nor Baidu are over that I believe. Do know that if you go the "pieces" route as you randomly mentioned this afternoon do know conglomerates get low multiples.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1361249192790</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 23:46:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361249792909-56</Id><Topic><Title>Short position vS.
