How can YHOO make such bad hires when they had Levinsohn already there, experienced, well liked, and making decisive moves in his short tenure. And all they really needed for him to do was negotiate a sale of the company, or its parts (and do a large buy back of shares). Now no one knows what is happening at YHOO except that the share price has fallen in a strong market, there is free food, and Marissa is having a baby.</Msg><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1345661466715</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 14:51:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345662370041-41</Id><Topic><Title>Boo Hoo Hoo</Title><Username>view12347</Username><Timestamp>1345661242960</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 14:47:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>guaranteed that we lose money these past years by not doing what clearly needs to be done and making very poor hires.

If you want at all, you will be able to pick up these shares again at 13,50 and lower this fall. There's more bad news for shareholders ahead, but even without them, the SP would decrease further. This is an honest suggestion. If you want to play YHOO you can do it at significantly lower prices than now.</Msg><Username>sunnyboy19999</Username><Timestamp>1345662696201</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 15:11:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345662878847-43</Id><Title>Dan Loeb Selling?</Title><Msg>From yesterdays volume and the cap at 15 is sure looks like someone is selling big.
