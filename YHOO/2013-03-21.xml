(4689) intends to strengthen its cooperation with Softbank Corp. (9984.TO) by jointly developing smartphones and related services, its incoming Chief Executive Officer told The Nikkei on Tuesday. Yahoo Japan, a joint venture between Softbank and Yahoo! Inc., holds a roughly 70% share of Japan's Web portal market. It is "looking to become No. 1 in smartphones as well," said Senior Vice President Manabu Miyasaka, who is slated to become CEO on April 1. The collaborations with Softbank will leverage the parent's strength in telecommunications and Yahoo Japan's Internet savvy, according to Miyasaka. Their joint efforts might include developing smartphones with built-in functions for using Yahoo-brand Internet services. The ability to launch applications rapidly is becoming increasingly crucial for succeeding in the competitive smartphone market. To speed application development, Yahoo Japan is considering beefing up its 2,000-strong development team. U.S. parent Yahoo!, which holds a 34.8% stake in Yahoo Japan, has been considering selling shareholdings in the unit for roughly two years. Yahoo Japan will continue negotiating with the U.S. parent on the matter, Miyasaka said.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1363877575595</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:52:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363877610836-31</Id><Topic><Title>Oppenheimer Upgrades Yahoo to Outperform with $27 PT</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1363876140345</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:29:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$27 this year!</Msg><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1363877610836</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:53:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363877769909-32</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Japan to deepen ties with Softbank, Nikkei reports</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1363875787802</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:23:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U.S. parent Yahoo!, which holds a 34.8% stake in Yahoo Japan, has been considering selling shareholdings in the unit for roughly two years.
