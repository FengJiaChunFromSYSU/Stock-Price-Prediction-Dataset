All of those things you mentioned are going to be bullish? It's going to continue this straight up move with no correction? It's that easy? So I ask, where is support down below and what breaks the uptrend. I ask because it seems whenever everyone thinks its going one way and start making predictions of $24, $25, and I even saw one of $100, the market has a way of shaking the tree and seeing who has the stamina to ride it out. Recent Apple activity come to mind. Just a thought........not bearish but rather...as Warren Buffet says....be fearful when everyone is greedy.

However, there is a very strong possibility that as Yahoo continues to grow market share people will become aware of how under valued it is and might send the price galloping to meet up with Google's PE and Price to book. What I can't be totally sure of is how Yahoo's market share gain will affect both Google and Microsoft, but it most certainly won't be positive.

To put this in perspective, over the same time frame Microsoft's (MSFT) Bing has only gained 1.14%. That means Yahoo is gaining traffic at almost double the rate of Bing. Though it can only ever be a rough approximation, we know that both Yahoo and Google (GOOG) generate sales from ads. So using that as a base we could do some hypothetical estimates for revenue growth for Yahoo. Google's Revenue for the last 12 months has been 47.45B, and they control 84.14% market share. If we assume for the sake of forecasting that all their revenue at some point can be correlated to their traffic, they make roughly 0.56B or 560 million per percent. Hypothetically this means in the next year Yahoo could see potential revenue increases of around $1 billion. This is all assuming conservative growth rates. The kicker is that Yahoo is trading at a Price to Book of 1.49, it's incredibly close to parity and its price to book has been on a decline since 2008. Google's price to book is 3.471. It stands to reason that Yahoo's strong push up starting from September came from a bounce caused by their price to book getting to a new low of 1.213. Growing EPS, low price to Book, and increasing revenue potential. If you're into value tech stocks, I think Yahoo is a prime choice. Even with their recent steep incline, there is still plenty more upward movement potential.</Msg><Username>tr420</Username><Timestamp>1355936419748</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 12:00:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355938844075-45</Id><Topic><Title>Guidance, $3B Buyback, 24% Alibaba Group, 35% Yahoo!

Check the ID - been using it for over a dozen years. No alias. Why is everyone so scared of a bearish opinion? To make money in the stock market, you have to be objective - you have to listen to bullish and bearish ideas and then make an objective decision. People that get emotional about stocks lose money. I think it's awesome that you made money long on Yahoo - great for you! I'd just hate to see you lose it again. And if you know thatt Cap Gains are going to double in 2013, why not lock in your profit at a lower rate and buy right back in after the wash sale period?

From technical point of view, Yahoo has already broken out from a six years huge bottom platform. Once consolidation is done, the first target is $25(2013), second target is $30(2014), the third target is $40(2015). Third points has controlled the board and Green Lights has just jumped in. Major shareholders are going to accumulate more Yahoo shares for the coming turnaround story. More funds are going to buy Yahoo since Apple has topped and Google is tradding flat for years. Yahoo is going to buy back huge amount of its floating shares to creat shortage of the floating shares. Yahoo P/E is only at 6 and P/E at 10 would mean $30 for Yahoo!</Msg><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1355950161685</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 15:49:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355950294185-72</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo is everything that user needs on internet and Marissa Mayer is going to put everything together...</Title><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1355950161685</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 15:49:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I forgot to mention that Yahoo core is bring in $1.3B cash every year and it's accelerating according to last quarter's report.</Msg><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1355950294185</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 15:51:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355950397323-73</Id><Topic><Title>Guidance, $3B Buyback, 24% Alibaba Group, 35% Yahoo!

And neither are people (even Yahoo) buying. Very low volume. Yahoo showed relative weakness when the market was up, and relative strength when the market was down. No clear signal. I would suppose that after a large run up, investors are waiting for someone large to lead. Up of Down. As soon as someone large causes Yahoo to move either way, others will jump on the bandwagon.

But now it seems people have become a bit overly optimistic. Now none of these things mean its going down, but rather suggest one should look for a possible correction from here and how to deal with it. Should I add more? Should I have a stop at some price down below just in case? It appears most of the post here assume the share price is only going one way and that is up. IT may very well, it may very well go down. But some of the post on this board are concerning. Just a few examples: 1. This is going to skyrocket 2. Could easily double from here 3. Everything is positive 4. It's cheap 5. No problem going to some price level, like $24 (that's up another 23% from here) I could go on. My only point is it's never easy and when post start looking like the above its getting close to correction time. The post that started this topic is classic, doesn't even take into account anything at arriving at a share price other than it could double and still be smaller than Google. The second post illustrates the recklessness of the first. So don't come after me for bashing-I'm just exercising caution after a 35% run. And a nice run it has been. But past performance is no guarentee of future performance and it seems a lot of folks here are betting it is!

One is that the $$ inflow to the market is flat (that every stock get the same) and that the Yhoo growth is related to the stock market, when in reality is related to the potential acquisition of mobile market's 200 billion new users. If the compound growth of the market is 7.4% and Yhoo maintain its market share it will double in 8 years, without gaining on GOOG.

Look people, if you want to be long Yahoo - great. Good for you. But let's be honest about the facts. Yahoo's INCOME is not growing. The only reason that Yahoo's earnings "grew" is because of sale of assets (classified as Other Income) - not operating income. Yahoo is operating at 16% operating margin (compare to Google at 28%). And the average analyst estimates (yeah, I know, you're smarter than the professional stock analysts) is for growth of 0.8% next year. Wow, less than one percent earnings growth. Sus, that should lead to a doubling of the stock. So be long if you want. But be honest about the facts.</Msg><Username>ca_fatboy</Username><Timestamp>1355965915635</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 20:11:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355967041591-103</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo is everything that user needs on internet and Marissa Mayer is going to put everything together...</Title><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1355950161685</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 15:49:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank goodness - a long that actually wants to talk about the stock instead of hurl insults and decry my birth that I would dare utter any word doubting Yahoo at anything less than $1,000 a share. Oh, if my reasoning only has two errors then I'm beating my average. Sure, you're right about the fungibility of dollars inbound being allocated unevenly. Of course, you're assuming positive inflow in 2013. As you can tell, I'm a bit of a bear right now. But for arguments sake, I'll grant you 7% growth in the broader market. You're also assuming that the sale of assets (Japan/Alibaba) will translate to the bottom line. I'm going to dispute that. You're talking about Balance Sheet transactions that won't (IMO) impact the EPS (and therefore stock price) unless they are invested to contribute to earnings. Increased dividends or sharebuyback could leverage the cash to increase stock value, though. I would also argue that the entire run from ~$15 is based on the MM likability factor. I think that particular arrow has left the quiver. So now it's down to real revenue/earnigns growth - not just selling assets or reducing the number of shares outstanding. Unless Yahoo shows an ability to grow revenue, I think the stock is dead in the water - absent the ~7% inflating baloon. But even then, Yahoo is already getting the benefit of the doubt - it's forward P/E is higher than Google based on the belief that MM is going to grow Yahoo faster than Google. If that doesn't start happening soon, I expect the goodwill aspect of the stock price ($3.50?) to evaporate. Anyway, thanks for the intellectual stock discussion. I wish you great profit (after I finish shorting).</Msg><Username>ca_fatboy</Username><Timestamp>1355967041591</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 20:30:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355967109456-104</Id><Topic><Title>My Ignorant Forecast</Title><Username>brainless_2004</Username><Timestamp>1355964370983</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 19:46:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of greater concern is this...... The last several 35% rallies were followed by $2-$3 declines. In addition, the last 5 times we were this far away from the 200 day moving average were in July 2009, Feb 2008, Oct 2007, Apr 2007, and Feb 2007. All 5 were followed by at least a 10% correction. And yes all 5 were massive runups. 3 of them even coincided with a 35% gain. So I wouldn't worry so much about whether its going to $20 but rather is it going to $17-$18 first? It's come a long way in a very short period of time. Correction time might just be around the corner. I'm not saying its all over....not at all....but do not be surprised and have a plan in place if a correction does occur.

It is better than 75% of the 'professionals.'' I agree that MM has to deliver, but not on Jan. Wall Street will justify any small improvement.

MM is a wall street darling right now. Anything positive now will receive an exagerated response. But I agree - wall street is a fickle lot - and if she isn't turning the Titanic by mid-2013, she'll get hammered. Plenty of money in the bank, and basically no debt. Yahoo has a great balance sheet. But without seeing the upturn in the P&amp;L, I'm just betting that we see a quick run down to $17.50 - $18.00. I'm the first to admit that I could be wrong about that. But you place your money and take your chances. Thanks for the response, Brainless.

There's 28K open interest on the 19's and only 16K on the 20's. I don't think there's enough open interest on the 20's relative to the trading volume to keep the price sub-$20. But I could be wrong. What do you think about the increase in Capital Gains taxes that will kick in on Jan 1? Regardless of the solution that our disfunctional politicians come up with, that will be in there. I have been expecting people to sell their winners to lock in the lower tax rate (I did), but that hasn't seemed to happen.

Decreasing volume and a .50 cent gap up from $15.77 that needs to be backfilled. It also appears that YHOO will not pay a special dividend. Now as far as a stock buyback. YHOO would be crazy to buy back stock now. I believe that they are waiting for the price to drop.
