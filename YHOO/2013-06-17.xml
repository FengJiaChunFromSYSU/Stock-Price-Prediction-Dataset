The company has achieved a strong production base in Africa, and for the next three years, it is striving to capitalize in the Middle East as well by building a $1.5 billion condensate refinery in Qatar. Total is surely a buy for the long-term, while dismal performance of Petrobras is a clear sigh of the company's struggles and efforts. While Exxon has undeniable potential, when compared to Total, I believe the French company holds the upper hand.</Msg><Username>scovey2</Username><Timestamp>1371482822322</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 11:27:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371482973442-14</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo stock off to a nice start again today.</Title><Username>randywms55</Username><Timestamp>1371481911645</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 11:11:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Coldone is always right.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1371482973442</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 11:29:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371483015970-15</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Taking Off!</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1370634650037</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 15:50:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wait until the real news hits.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1371483015970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 11:30:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371483088774-16</Id><Topic><Title>The good old “cash-rich split”</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1371100355845</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 01:12:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yahoo will trade over $30 this year according to coldone.

This business, for over 10 years now is on "Red", never made profit yet, and last year losses is over $2B. However this latest news about AAPL making Bing as search default could change the equation. On the other hand, YHOO wants their search back from MSFT. My final analysis we might have a cash-rich split deal here that Bing will be included in the deal. My personal opinion only.

Yahoo will bring all the money back to California and pay the taxes. Ballmer is about to shock Wall Street "experts" yet again (which he really relishes doing) with yet another good quarter as Windows Phones, Windows Tablets, Azure, Enterprise and MS Office by subscription are all new revenue streams. Plus the Enterprise side of MSFT is eating up the landscape. The new deal with Apple and Bing pretty much seals that deal. Yahoo will probably be bought by Microsoft, Apple or Google in a short time with Marissa Mayer taking the helm of whichever ship that buys Yahoo. The tax savings is paltry compared to the bidding war potential that Dan Loeb wants to happen. Muddying the waters with a split would make selling the house messier. I did M&amp;A's since the 1980's for 3 Fortune 500 companies. Buyers don't want to buy sticky companies. They want them clean. Yahoo will be bought for over $50. Possibly $60. Not just for the value, but because the meat clever the buyer will have against the other two.</Msg><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1371493241514</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:20:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371493945068-22</Id><Title>hasn't done much lately</Title><Msg>Seems to have topped out</Msg><Username>todlondon</Username><Timestamp>1371493945068</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 14:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371494262883-23</Id><Title>When is Yahoo buying Twitter?</Title><Msg>Doesn't it make sense for Yahoo to do this?

DRAM is trading at 0.2 X sales compared to 1.2 sector. In last Q earnings ending January 31, the CEO predicted that because of a recovery in memory prices DRAM would be profitable in 2013 and beyond. Since then memory prices have jumped more than doubles and DRAM has recently announced a huge manufacturing deal with AMD on top of that. Two main reasons for rapidly improving fundamentals: 1…Memory prices have almost doubled this year and were 70% higher in the quarter to be reported soon vs. the previous quarter. Traditionally, the memory business was DRAM's main business having been a pioneer and a respected company since 1967. DRAM prices continue to literally explode during the current quarter and are expected to continue to go up into 2015 due to manufacturing shortages and high demand. 2....AMD and DRAM recently announced in May (5/8/2013 AMD and 5/10/2013 DRAM) that they have agreed on a significant partnership. DRAM will be AMD's memory-manufacturing partner to produce AMD's new Gamer Series memory. Gamer Series memory is compatible with AMD and Intel platforms, supporting both AMP and XMP memory profiles. The software is based on DRAM's RAMDisk technology. "AMD Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series Memory is armed with features designed to outperform the competition on any task," said Roman Kyrychynskyi, product director, Graphics Business Unit, AMD. "Designed with multi-platform compatibility in mind, the AMD Radeon RG2133 brings cutting-edge technology, as well as uncompromising quality and compatibility for PC gamers. "AMD and Dataram have worked together to significantly enhance the dynamic background load-and-save feature in order to create a seamless, non-volatile RAMDisk experience," said Jason Caulkins, CTO, Dataram. "This underscores AMD and Dataram's commitment to delivering the fastest/best memory products."</Msg><Username>joeyggrecco</Username><Timestamp>1371509546310</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 18:52:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371510044770-43</Id><Topic><Title>CONGRATULATIONS YAHOO!</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1371424726257</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 19:18:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope you are right but I am happy with $30 to $35 this year.

Speaking of Netflix, why would you want Yahoo to buy them when I recommended it 4yrs ago under $40 and again it was rumored Yahoo was involved when it imploded down to $50 but you'd rather pay $250 or so.

The government is big, but is not big enough to overhear every phone conversation being made at one time. Part of a court order is to focus the recording to a specific phone number or numbers. It takes time to place the device to overhear the message. So what I disagree with is that a single person can place a wiretap on any person immediately or even in a very short period because I believe it takes time to setup the listening device.</Msg><Username>petting_a_phoenix</Username><Timestamp>1371512836672</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 19:47:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371516197657-48</Id><Topic><Title>Get ready - Alibaba IPO announcement anyday!!</Title><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1371156079298</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 16:41:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, the story is out and Dish response was "tender period is over".

Also, does this make sence, I buy 2000 on margin and hold it overnight, then the next day do the same thing, that way when the Alibaba IPO news comes out I'll be holding those shares instead of buying after the new's, all the time selling before I get charged for that loan, Im thinking that new's alone could be a $2.00 to the upside if not more, Im at 50 % profit already so even a small loss day to day won't hurt if this thing takes a few down day's, but the reward for holding extra shares when an IPO is announced will be to good to pass up. Even if it goes down fast Im thinking I can hold onto them for a year and the interest will only be a little over $3,000, Alibaba should announce by then so the price should go back up protecting me from a loss. Of course praying at the same time won't hurt !!! Any thoughts...
