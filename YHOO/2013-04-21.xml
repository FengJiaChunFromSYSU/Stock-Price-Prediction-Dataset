PRESIDENT OBAMA: In this age of instant reporting and tweets and blogs, there's a temptation to latch on to any bit of information, sometimes to jump to conclusions. But when a tragedy like this happens, with public safety at risk and the stakes so high, it's important that we do this right. That's why we have investigations. That's why we relentlessly gather the facts. That's why we have courts. And that's why we take care not to rush to judgment -- not about the motivations of these individuals; certainly not about entire groups of people. (April 19, 2013) William Charles "Bill" Ayers In 1969 he co-founded the Weather Underground, a self-described communist revolutionary group[2] that conducted a campaign of bombing public buildings (including police stations, the U.S. Capitol Building, and the Pentagon) during the 1960s and 1970s in response to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. He is a retired professor in the College of Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, formerly holding the titles of Distinguished Professor of Education and Senior University Scholar.[3] During the 2008 US presidential campaign, a controversy arose over his contacts with then-candidate Barack Obama. He is married to Bernardine Dohrn, who was also a leader in the Weather organization.</Msg><Username>onedanelectroman</Username><Timestamp>1366555339681</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 10:42:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366555953033-8</Id><Title>Yhoo is a cheap stock and worth almost twice its current price.</Title><Msg>Yahoo is generating a ton of cash and will continue to.

CCUR is only $6.66 with 8.72mm shares outstanding and a market cap of $58mm. It has $24.6mm in cash and no debt. Enterprise value is only $33.5mm or just 0.53X its trailing revenue of $63mm. Their 2Q 2013 EPS was up 100% from 1Q 2013 and their CCUR's 1Q 2013 EPS was up 100% from 4Q 2012. Their 3Q 2013 EPS is due out at the end of April! If you watch video on demand using your cable TV service and subscribe to Time Warner Cable, Charter, Bright House, or Cox, CCUR provides your VOD services and they just signed another major unnamed top 5 North American pay-TV company for VOD! CCUR recently signed a huge multi-screen TV contract with Virgin Media (VMED) - the largest cable TV company in the UK. CCUR's net income is likely to continue exploding in the quarters ahead and the stock could quickly double or triple!</Msg><Username>jtdmnf533</Username><Timestamp>1366602381773</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 23:46:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
