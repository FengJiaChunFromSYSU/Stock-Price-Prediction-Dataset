Amazon and E-Bay total $163 Billion (100B and 63B) in Market Cap. Alibaba Group should easily get to $100 Billion. 23% of $100B is $23 Billion +800m in preferred stock= $23.8B Billion. $17B billion after tax +6 Billion in cash +5 Billion in Yahoo Japan So Yahoo will soon have $28 Billion in cash and no debt but is currently trading at $21 Billion. Yahoo core that is generating $1 Billion in cash flow a year should at a minimum is worth $8 Billion. 36 Billion. Plus the value of the cash to invest in new businesses, buy new businesses raises the value of Yahoo core. So at a minimum the company is worth $31.00 a share.

They wanted to get quarter results from Alibaba and their 11/11 results also, imo. Probably will give good guidance and the stock will run up. Remember Alibaba posted 1+ billion in last quarter and $3b in sales on 11/11. The only unknown is what margin Alibaba ran on 11/11. I think the guidance will contain a lot about Alibaba and what they think of its future. Maybe they have secured a buyer for Yahoo Japan or have sold some of their holdings in it also. We will see.. I don't believe much buy back has been going on with so many others interested in buying. I think it would of been very tough for Yahoo to accumulate more than 10 to 20 million shares.... jmho</Msg><Username>optionstrader4u</Username><Timestamp>1353198296030</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 19:24:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353198736352-16</Id><Topic><Title>Did Yahoo Begin Their $3 billion Buyback?</Title><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1353097902720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 15:31:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just for most peoples information the most a company can buy in one day is about 3 to 5 percent of what is traded that day. Any more and the stock would spike. Buying back stock is a long and complicated process especially when you are trading a stock that is now in the cross hairs of a lot of big investors. I think the most Yahoo can do daily is about 1 to 1.5 million shares on a good day. So if they were attempting to buy back it would take them over 100 to 150 trading days. This is just how it works. But it is a positive thing that the stock has gone up so well and Yahoo has just begun its venture.</Msg><Username>optionstrader4u</Username><Timestamp>1353198736352</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 19:32:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353199454352-17</Id><Topic><Title>Did Yahoo Begin Their $3 billion Buyback?</Title><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1353097902720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 15:31:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A $1 to $2 billion buyback in this quarter is possible and likely.</Msg><Username>ashton10shyof</Username><Timestamp>1353199454352</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 19:44:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353199455601-18</Id><Topic><Title>Did Yahoo Begin Their $3 billion Buyback?</Title><Username>nanobot8042</Username><Timestamp>1353097902720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-16 15:31:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the difference is in this case Yahoo's core value (Alibaba, COH, and Yahoo Japan) after tax is about 15+ billion. That is a put under this stock at that amount about $15pps. Also, Yahoo is trying to buy back almost 20% of its float which is very, very difficult considering you have to convince institutions to sell their shares because between insiders and institutions they own 80% of the shares. You then have the remaining 20% of which more than half are probably long term holders so that leaves you about 100 million liquid shares to trade. A lot of what people see are day traders entering in the beginning and then leaving at eod turning over the same shares every day.. Anytime you see a stock being talked about a lot and has high volume you see tons of day traders. I personally do not think Yahoo may not be able to buy back that many shares and may decide on giving a one time dividend of $2.75.. Just a thought. This is another reason why guidance was delayed was because of what was happening with some of the tax changes. We will see and good luck to all longs.</Msg><Username>optionstrader4u</Username><Timestamp>1353199455601</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 19:44:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353200053447-19</Id><Topic><Title>Take on the coldone...if you dare - Buy or sell at $17.80?</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1353199308824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 19:41:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just Yahoo's core holdings will take it over $20.
