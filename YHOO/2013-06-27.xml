In a blog post on the company’s official Tumblr page, VP of Product Mike Kerns described the refresh as “a more personal, intuitive and modern design.” “It may look familiar — this new design is one step towards creating a more consistent feel across Yahoo!” Kerns wrote. To be sure, the new page is in line with Yahoo’s billion-dollar Tumblr acquisition, very much focused on the “stream,” a never-ending scroll of content moving across the page. It will also include relevant, newsy tweets folded into the stream, as a result of the recent partnership between Yahoo and Twitter. The bigger deal, though, is the personalization aspect. You’re able to sign in using a Yahoo ID, then pick and choose your preferences for the content you want to appear on the page. Over time, Kerns said, the news page will end up learning what sort of stuff you want to see and present you with more of it. It’s all part of Yahoo’s grand push to personalize content for all of its regular users, so instead of just being a hub for stuff, folks will find it a destination with items tailored to their wants and needs. Mayer, as well as COO Henrique de Castro, have pushed this idea hard. It seems like it’s slowly coming to life. Expect the new look to roll out on the Web, as well as on Android and iOS devices, in the next few weeks.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372355246695</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:47:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372355284572-23</Id><Topic><Title>It would be absolutely great,</Title><Username>rlday2010</Username><Timestamp>1372354850115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:40:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're trash.</Msg><Username>stronghold812</Username><Timestamp>1372355284572</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:48:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372355474167-24</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo News Face-Lift Puts Focus on Personalization</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372355246695</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:47:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's all coming together under Marissa Mayer's expert guidance.</Msg><Username>stronghold812</Username><Timestamp>1372355474167</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:51:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372357076204-25</Id><Topic><Title>It would be absolutely great,</Title><Username>rlday2010</Username><Timestamp>1372354850115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:40:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>do you think LEN should give free upgrades with home purchase ?</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1372357076204</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 14:17:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372357185144-26</Id><Topic><Title>It would be absolutely great,</Title><Username>rlday2010</Username><Timestamp>1372354850115</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:40:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sorry wrong board</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1372357185144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 14:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372357950045-27</Id><Title>Fed governors play good cop bad cop....</Title><Msg>Bernanke comes in and says we'll taper, and will end QE next year, then Dudley today says we won't do that, we may increase the stimulus.....

Last month was the IPO of DATA and it raised $254.2mm at $31 per share, closing its first day of trading up 63.7% to $50.75! DATA is now $56.68 up 82.8% from its IPO and is trading with a market cap of $3.26 billion with sales of only $143mm! The VC firm that funded Facebook (FB), Accel, just announced that they are investing $100mm to start Big Data Fund 2. According to Google Trends, interest in Big Data Analytics has soared every single month in 2013 so far - with buzz up 66.7% since the end of 2012. In the 19 months since Accel formed their first $100mm Big Data Fund, buzz about Big Data Analytics has increased 567%! More Big Data companies are expected to file for IPOs very soon! We are about to experience a modern day Gold Rush as Big Data revolutionizes a wide range of industries - including the cable TV industry! An article "How Big Data Keeps Cable TV Watchers Hooked" recently published discusses how cable TV operators are using Big Data to launch ad campaigns that follow users from TV to the web, while stopping users from migrating to NFLX. The #1 Big Data Analytics firm serving pay-TV operators is already public, but nobody is even aware of it yet: Concurrent Computer (CCUR). CCUR could double or triple fast as Big Data investors begin to discover it! CCUR is currently $7.39 with an enterprise value of only $42.32mm or 0.67X sales of $63.23mm vs. DATA trading with a price/sales ratio of 22.79! CCUR only needs a business valuation of 2X sales for it to more than double to $17, and a business valuation of 3X sales for it to more than triple to $24.22! CCUR's revenues, gross profits, operating income, and EPS - has risen quarter-after-quarter for 12 months straight! CCUR's 3Q EPS was up 175% YOY and its 4Q results could be very strong due to the recent signing of a HUGE deal with Virgin Media! CCUR has an amazing looking chart!</Msg><Username>goodwe212</Username><Timestamp>1372362104209</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 15:41:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372362308303-30</Id><Topic><Title>also no YAHOO CUSTOMER SERVICE, email, or phone number to call for trouble</Title><Username>sonofapreacher888</Username><Timestamp>1372344799869</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 10:53:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're not a customer.

Why do you think Yahoo's OMG entertainment site grew so big just after a few months of launching. Celebrity gossip is huge! By the way, this is why Yahoo is preaching personalization. So if you get "fluff", you simply tell Yahoo you don't want to see that anymore. That's what I did. At the beginning (when they launched the new site) I spent lest than 10 minutes (over several days) closing out stories in my feed I wasn't interested in. Now all I get are news stories about my favorite sports teams, politics, music, etc. For example, when the latest story about Paula Dean showed up, I clicked the "X" next to the header and BAM...no more stories related to Paula Dean in my stream!</Msg><Username>iggysweet28</Username><Timestamp>1372371844556</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 18:24:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372371945566-38</Id><Title>Any "big news" about YJ or say Alibaba!!</Title><Msg>I expect $1 to $2 up minimum for YHOO.

You may not have noticed, but the stock has been on a tear lately: through Monday’s close, Nokia’s stock had rallied 80% since closing at $1.80 on July 10. The stock added to recent gains on Monday in the wake of last Friday’s big win for Apple against Samsung in their closely watched patent case. But the stock slipped back 6.8% yesterday, and has extended the slide this morning. In truth, there’s no real reason to think the stock can’t slide all the way back to the July lows. Or lower Ferragu notes two key events ahead that poses risks for Nokia shares: the company’s Nokia World event next week, with the company expects to unveil new Windows-based Lumia phones, and September quarter financial results. He also thinks it would be “naive” to think that Apple’s patent victory over Samsung will translate into more sales of Nokia phones. “We believe it would be naive of us to consider last week’s ruling a positive for Nokia and more broadly Windows-based phones,” he writes. “Our research shows that for many years, poor sales of Windows-based phones stem from a deep and stable lack of consumer interest for the product. Despite numerous and repeated efforts of manufacturers (Nokia, but also Samsung and HTC) and operators to develop an alternative to Android and Apple based on Windows, and despite the launch of numerous phones based on Windows with strong features, reviews and marketing support, the operating system remains cornered to less than 5% market share in smartphones. The lack of consumer interest for Windows-based phones has been very consistent in marketing surveys we have carried out across the globe over the last several years.” Ferragu adds that “given the strength of Android and Apple today in consumers’ minds and the scale of both ecosystems, it is unrealistic to believe anything short of a true product revolution, like the iPhone was in its time, could instill life into an alternative platform.” In short, the Bernstein analyst contends that the recent rally in Nokia shares is largely undeserved. “We see no improvement in fundamentals, and see an opportunity to initiate new short positions (or add to an existing ones) this week,” he writes. “We recently pointed out channel promotions in the U.K., whereby Lumia 610 and 710 were being discounted by over 50%. This is particularly uncommon and went with feedback from distributors about Lumia phones still gathering virtually no consumer traction. We now believe this lack of Lumia Phone traction is more widespread than our previous sample checks.” He asserts that Nokia’s Q3 results could fall short of expectations, and contends that the company could issue a warning ahead of the scheduled report date in October. He’s looking for device sales and operating profits to be well below consensus. “On fundamentals, we believe the company is set on a long and painful journey in which it will likely have to reduce its current size by a lot before returning to profits, providing little floor to the share price in the medium term,” he writes. “The most likely outcome we see for the company is to serve a niche Windows Phone market and maintain a decent volume business in the very low end of the feature phone / basic phone market. This would imply 3 years of difficult transformation with the company’s sales and opex reduced by 37% and 28%, compared to 2011 levels.” Ferragu has an Underperform rating and $1.56 target price on the stock. NOK today is down 20 cents, or 6.4%, to $2.84.</Msg><Username>sydneylocks</Username><Timestamp>1372373708909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 18:55:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372375697514-42</Id><Topic><Title>also no YAHOO CUSTOMER SERVICE, email, or phone number to call for trouble</Title><Username>sonofapreacher888</Username><Timestamp>1372344799869</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 10:53:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not a problem.

What really funny is that even phone companies won't talk to you unless it's their sells dept.. So here is the trick. Call the sells dept. of any corporation and ask them if they will transfer you. This works about 50% of the time. Remember, this is typical American corporate foundation. NEVER talk to an established customer as they may ask you to fix a problem or issue. It cost money to hire the people to deal with your issues and they really don't give a damn. Just make sure you pay or they will go after your credit report like a fly to #$%$. After all, they spent good money advertising to tell you how good they are to get their claws on you in the first place.
