Given that Yahoo owns Alibaba and Yahoo Japan and it was apparent, 9 out of 10 people who used the internet check Yahoo to see media news. Yahoo did not know how to make money, but AAPL does. Also if you look at the revenue stabilization by Yahoo for years ... and not deteration, you know Yahoo has built a solid brand and justed needed someone like Google or Apple or Samsung to start making that flow of cash expanding their existing platforms. I was shocked how negative analysts have been against Yahoo, when they were clearly executing a very very different and difficult business plan and was pretty good at doing it. Essentially with what Yahoo owned, buying Yahoo would be like scooping up a great company for free. MSFT is too retarded to do it right, I think Balmer is an idiot and based on principle, I am glad Yahoo did not sell it to MSFT ... I know, money was good, but I also saw Balmer being a disrespecting #$%$ .... if you recall Jerry and his co-founder was on their way up to MSFT to prepare to sit down for negotiation. Balmer called off the meeting and pumping his chest like an ape and claimed that a couple more bucks that Yahoo wanted and fighted for its share holders were unacceptable. Okay, now Samsung is partnering up with Yahoo, lets see if they will scoop up Yahoo eventually.... which they will need to compete against AAPL and Google.. Samsung has been making really great business decisions and producing great products. So lets see what is next....</Msg><Username>fpl1971</Username><Timestamp>1352285524409</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 05:52:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352288133573-5</Id><Topic><Title>Colorado Legalizes Marijuana for Recreational Use for Adults</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1352263251919</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-06 23:40:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now I know why "the coldone" imagines all those phantom buys.

Yahoo has about 18,000 workers. That is waaaaaaaaaay too much. Everybody knows the company has a bloated headcount. Everybody knows that there are many, many workers who are simply not productive. Yahoo needs to quickly figure out which departments, employees to cut. IMHO, the “simple” way to figure it out is to ask….which departments are profitable, about to make a profit or will never make a profit. Big companies usually have a lot of “pet projects” that will never materialize or monetize. I’m sure Yahoo has the same. Get rid of these pet projects that won’t bring in future revenue. Also get rid of the “empty suits.” These are Execs with the great titles that do nothing and add nothing to the bottom line. Simple as that. I vote for a 10% to 15% decrease in head count. Yahoo is going higher, notice the historic charts. Once it hit $16 and change, it soared to $40+ Can history repeat?</Msg><Username>crabcakes888</Username><Timestamp>1352297072667</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 09:04:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352297483647-14</Id><Topic><Title>Im selling 45,000 shares....Obomacare will further ruin economy</Title><Username>mrs_vomit</Username><Timestamp>1352296017506</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 08:46:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed. sellng my shares as well.

Yahoo is down a bit but missed the massive sell offs (see aapl, msft, and really almost everything), hence a big chunk of my investments have remained intact today. Saddened by all the negative trash talk and Anti-Obama talk (anti-American talk) on many of the message boards (in particular I note distasteful posts on aapl; but, really, they are pretty ubiquitous today). Seems like folks would rather lose money or cause others to lose money than to move forward in a positive direction for the next four years. Yhoo remains poised to move forward positively. I think that it is still undervalued compared with most of the stocks that dropped at a much faster rate today.

This is about half of the “industry” multiple of 11x. If Yahoo traded for a premium to AOL but still than industry EV-to-EBITDA multiple of 8.5x, its market cap would be $21.25 billion. Spread over 533 million shares, Yahoo!’s stock price would close 2013 at $39.87. Note that this path to $40 is without any cash-rich splits. The risks of course are that Alibaba doesn’t IPO in 2013 and that Yahoo can’t come to an agreement with Softbank. Marissa Mayer might not be able to squeeze out an extra $500 million in EBITDA out of the company over the next year, in addition to EBITDA increases from a reduced headcount.

It could also be Silver Lake adding to the already 5% ownership. They are also part of Alibaba and maybe they know Alibaba is going to go public soon. Their agreement with Yahoo says it has to be done by 2015 but the owner of Alibaba wants to do it much much sooner. He said it could be done next year at any time. Yahoo would have a 20%+ ownership in Alibaba and the whisper numbers are that Alibaba could see revenues of 50 billion a year. That is staggering. They own the majority of the e-commerce in china and you probably know that China is in the process of transforming from a producer to a consumer. Yahoo could be a $100 stock in a few years.China's e-commerce is doubling every year and this could be great for Yahoo. jmho</Msg><Username>optionstrader4u</Username><Timestamp>1352345902345</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 22:38:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352346042910-75</Id><Topic><Title>Here's How Yahoo!

Whether it's Yahoo or Silver Lake doing the buying, one thing for sure - there has been consistent accumulation on a daily basis. In terms of the stock going to $100 in a few years. I disagree....if history plays out it will be $100 stock in about 1.5 years. : Check out the old charts. On 9/98 the price was $16.18. By 12/99 the price was $107.70. http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=YHOO+Interactive#symbol=YHOO;range=my Granted, this is a different year and a different decade...I would say the story is better and the company is stronger than the Yahoo of 1999. My "guess" is Yahoo to $100 in 1.5 years and then to unchartered territory thereafter.....do I hear $200, $300+ :</Msg><Username>crabcakes888</Username><Timestamp>1352348833180</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 23:27:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352349911880-77</Id><Topic><Title>Here's How Yahoo!

There is no doubt it! I see easily $3 to $5 to YHOO share price. It could be very conservative estimate. YHOO has 24% stakes including the preferred shares.
