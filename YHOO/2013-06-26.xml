Some of the biggest names in the industry that support local ad networks claim to give advertisers the freedom to schedule the time of day a target audience will be served an ad, and where on the page the ad will appear. In reality, the process of targeting time can be arduous and requires careful manual adjustment, if it can be done at all. Assuring ad placement is, for many local ad networks, a premium service, and the larger players often don’t offer the kind of customization necessary to assure the ads you pay for are seen.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1372225618854</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 01:46:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372227189084-3</Id><Title>Any upgrade coming tomorrow?</Title><Msg>Wait and see.</Msg><Username>scrapman50</Username><Timestamp>1372227189084</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 02:13:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372227925411-4</Id><Topic><Title>SHORTING YHOO HERE!!!</Title><Username>stockpro732</Username><Timestamp>1371789768612</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 00:42:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IUHI</Msg><Username>tryme877</Username><Timestamp>1372227925411</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 02:25:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372248702652-5</Id><Title>Has done great over last one year</Title><Msg>Growth in the stock has been good, and despite the correction from the highs, it remains more than 60% up on a 52 week basis. The real uptrend started after the new CEO took over, and the growth is based on hopes of better business performance. Though the revenue guidance for 2013 is lower by 10%, the operating income is expected to double to $1.1 billion. Cost rationalization and acquisition of talent has been the focus. Many of the smaller acquisitions have been done to get talent from the mobile space / apps on board. Increased usage on mobile devices has been the key focus area of several tech companies like Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB). Better / easier user experience has helped Yahoo increase usage of its emails on mobile. There has been increased usage of Flickr also. As hinted by the CEO, one can expect more acquisitions over the next few quarters. It has sufficient cash on books and seems to be hungry for growth. There is lot of work to do as not all parameters are showing improvement. The global ad revenue share may fall in the current year. However, there is likely to be reduced dependence on advertising revenues. There is likely to be more emphasis on alternative models and the search-engine business. New fast growing segments may help the company support the growth story. It has some interest in fantasy sports which is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years. That space is attracting investment from big and small players like Comcast (CMCSA) and MGT Capital Investments (MGT). Tumblr is expected to increase traffic for Yahoo and establish it in the social networking space. The recent appreciation in stock price has, however, factored a lot of the future positives. But many analysts still prefer Yahoo to relatively overvalued tech / social networking companies.</Msg><Username>investora2z</Username><Timestamp>1372248702652</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 08:11:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372251167293-6</Id><Title>Question for you yahoo.</Title><Msg>You did a lot of revamping with programs and had some great ideas....

Though the share price is up substantially since Marissa Mayer became CEO, when you back out the value for Alibaba and Yahoo Japan, the value of Yahoo's core assets have not risen that much. However, Ms. Mayer has, in my opinion, done well to add value and even demonstrate movement in the difficult to measure mobile category. With that game up for grabs, it could serve as Yahoo's foray back from obscurity. With Alibaba and Yahoo Japan's "put" on the stock, I believe that the price could move above $30 or $35 by the end of 2013. If Yahoo can continue to build on mobile growth in Flickr and its email property, then the outlook for the company becomes much more appealing - potentially leading the stock to double in the next couple years.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372276977859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:02:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372278006160-26</Id><Topic><Title>Upside To Yahoo Can't Be Ignored</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372276977859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:02:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am totally agree with your post. Without question, MM is doing a great job for YHOO. With that alone, YHOO shares movements should UP UP UP, the only way. What will be interesting here, however; is that how is Alibaba now and down the road. Likewise, YHOO Japan is having exploding growth and projected to continue. The latter YHOO's 35% stakes could be worth $9B to $12B now. If growing robustly, can YHOO stakes to grow to $15B next year or next two years. So I would conclude YHOO Asian assets alone could potentially put YHOO to $30 to $40 per share. Yes baby $30 to $35 this year!!</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1372278006160</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:20:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372278239408-27</Id><Topic><Title>Upside To Yahoo Can't Be Ignored</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372276977859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:02:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan Melissa Mayer has made a lot of headlines the past year, and, I think, gone a long way to demonstrate Yahoo is on a path to sustainability. However, the rise in the stock over the past year is more a result of the performance of its Asian properties than more faith in the core business. Despite Ms. Mayer's focus, Yahoo's real value continues to be in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan (YAHOY.PK). A $60 billion valuation for the Chinese e-commerce and search company, Alibaba - which may be the low end of a late-2013 IPO - puts Yahoo's 24 percent stake at around $14.4 billion. That equates to nearly half of the company's current market cap. When Alibaba IPOs, it will have the right to purchase back half of Yahoo's stake, in addition to $835 million in preferred shares the company owns. At a $60 billion valuation, that would give Yahoo over $8 billion in cash. At a $100 billion valuation - the top end of the range - Yahoo would reap nearly $13 billion. Yahoo also owns 35 percent in Yahoo Japan - a company that is also seeing tremendous growth. Yahoo Japan is also doing quite well, experiencing a 13 percent year-over-year increase in profits at Yahoo's last filing. That puts Yahoo's stake in that company at around $6 billion. While there has been discussion in the broader market about the "Bernanke Put," for Yahoo, there is the Asian Put. With those properties becoming increasingly valuable (anywhere from $22 to $30 billion), it will be difficult to see the stock price move below $20 per share. The current share price does not leave much by way of value for Yahoo's core business, particularly when backing out the $2.78 per share in cash the company holds.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372278239408</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:23:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372278491252-28</Id><Topic><Title>Upside To Yahoo Can't Be Ignored</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372276977859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:02:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Load up baby!!</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1372278491252</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:28:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372280630629-29</Id><Title>uvxy and xvsy</Title><Msg>and now etfs that are a combination of both? i thought king said this was designed to forever go down .. are the big boys realizing this and thus creating etfs to short? i'm lost ... seems like we are headed to the old derivative to no end bush administration but now its green (and black) under obama?</Msg><Username>frederick_kimberly</Username><Timestamp>1372280630629</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 17:03:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372281749108-30</Id><Topic><Title>Ms Mayer...this O'fart understands after yesterday...</Title><Username>madmilker70</Username><Timestamp>1372253596729</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:33:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard Greg Penner gave you that job?

This should be a good time to start loading the boat. I finally decided this evening that I will once again re-enter. I had previously bought this stock on Dec 31 for 2.41 and sold Apr 9th for 5.99. I watched all kinds of bottom being predicted knowing there was no bottom in yet. A bottom usually occurs after a wash out or with a new higher high and a higher low on above average volume. So let me say this, this could only be a correction to the down trend because of the volume was just average. But I think not. I think not because of the length and time frame of the correction the fact there is a divvy due next month which is very close to earnings. Of course this is all just an educated guess after trading these stocks for 20 plus years. Don't be disappointed if this don't to an about face and go straight to that magic 8.75 number. Then again, I could be a 100% wrong about it all. But I'm a buyer tomorrow on what I am guessing.

They say that there will not be a good opportunity before Q4 . This is great news to Yahoo as their rev is growing 80% YoY and Yahoo's is in the single digits. Given the current cash availability to Yahoo, we should wait for the $200B IPO in 2014!</Msg><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1372290153078</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 19:42:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372293162144-36</Id><Topic><Title>Good news for Yahoo (kinda)</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1372290153078</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 19:42:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Their revenue WAS growing at 80% YoY. The big slowdown in China is going to dramatically reduce that so this could end up being really bad news for Yahoo. Good entry position for a short here.

If anything, Chinese investors are all looking for somewhere to put their money that they believe will really grow. It's Alibaba. This is going to be a superstar IPO. Jack Ma will not want to delay it. I'm convinced, but not too proud to say I could be wrong. I just think everyone involved with Alibaba want to move forward. A slowdown only gets slower and a turn around takes a long time, so it behooves Ma and gang to move forward.</Msg><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1372297568118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 21:46:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372299875959-41</Id><Topic><Title>Comscore May Results are Out</Title><Username>webdave_2000</Username><Timestamp>1372119486854</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 20:18:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes!</Msg><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1372299875959</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:24:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372299950685-42</Id><Topic><Title>Upside To Yahoo Can't Be Ignored</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372276977859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:02:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's a gold mine.</Msg><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1372299950685</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 22:25:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372300683080-43</Id><Topic><Title>Upside To Yahoo Can't Be Ignored</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372276977859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 16:02:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must be losing money shorting YHOO.
