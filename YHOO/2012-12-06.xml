This time, however, YHOO is dealing with YHOO Japan management and not Softbank. This deal will go all the way this time. It is in the best interest of YHOO Japan to make a deal for one big reason--they will be the majority owner of YHOO Japan after the deal. I think Morgan Stanley and Deusthbank will handle the financing of the deal; Day one today to six months===we have a deal!!!!.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1354770594168</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 00:09:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354771039383-3</Id><Topic><Title>Message to Hotmodel</Title><Username>mrjojangles2</Username><Timestamp>1354738400572</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 15:13:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I said ALMOST!!!haha Canada has quite a few billionaires though as David Thomson, I think is from there, owns Thomson publishing among other things. Half the Shark Tank in Robert Herjavic and Mr. Wonderful, Kevin O'Leary is from there. US still has the highest number but with commodities and basic services exploding you're getting billionaires EVERYWHERE. Russia-commodities like iron, nickel and Bojangles palladium. Mexico-cell phones and infrastructure, asia-real estate, Australia-commodities. I read on that Rhinehart lady, her dad found an area the size of Texas, kept quiet till he got the mineral rights and now she's worth $20B. She did dramatically increase her cut of the royalties as it went from few million to hundreds of millions. My point is unlike hundreds or thousands of years ago in a caste system...YOU can succeed! The Forbes list really doesn't have many that have "inherited" it...lots of self-made ones. US seems slightly better odds but I'm impartial. There was a stat I had seen it said 15,000 people are worth $100M+ in the US...couple hundred thousand are worth $10M and 3M are millionaires(not sure on that last figure).

Chief amongst the latter was how not to treat engineers. Yahoo, despite many well-intentioned efforts and notable exceptions, did not empower engineers. Even though we engineers created tons of value, it was the non-engineers who were often the gatekeepers. Eventually many of the best people noticed, got fed up and left. After I left in 2007 to co-found Polyvore, one of my main goals in life became building an environment that highly values engineers and treats them as first class citizens. I continue to strongly believe that all sorts of good things follow from that. I have since been thinking about why engineers are systematically undervalued compared to more traditional roles given the tremendous value they create.</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1354797608152</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 07:40:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354798519143-13</Id><Topic><Title>Plaintiff in Mexico Yahoo case says open to a settlement</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1354741445752</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:04:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>....huge, NOT hugh, which is Hef's first name.

If her experience at Google taught her anything it's: 1.) The incredible importance of company culture. and 2.) How to manage the design, development, and distribution of high-quality and extremely popular consumer web applications. The company culture at Yahoo! pre-Meyer and post-Meyer are night and day differences. Nobody is truly perfect, but I think Marissa was the perfect person for this position.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

The CFO isn't the final decision maker - MM is. Perhaps the board doesn't want guidance especially Loeb. The board certainly don't want to come out and say they aren't going to give guidance as that would hurt the stock price. Even then guidance is often meaningless. Revenue and earnings can fall apart in a few weeks. The best guidance is what Loeb is doing with his position. What action Yahoo is taking with the Mexican case, which I believe will cost Yahoo at least $1 billion payable in March 2013. How fast are Facebooks revenues growing, especially in mobile. What Son is telling his Softbank shareholders about his interest in Yahoo Japan. (That is in Softbanks Filings.) The list goes on. Those are the places you find guidance.

It appears that if she has any plan it must be long term, 3 - 5 years, which is fine but will not keep the stock moving up for much longer. Right now YHOO is on Goldman's list and rated 10 by many rating agencies, buy, strong buy etc. so how can it get any better? Next year's EPS, estimated by the same folks that rate it a buy are the same in 2013 as 2012. Something does not add up. I have been wrong on my shorts thus far but longer term I can hold them and add to them because the consensus so strong that I can not see it going anywhere but down. Of course I would say this but seriously, the PE has gone up significantly and EPS will NOT go up so why will YHOO not fall faster than AAPL? Google, AOL have stronger track records and Google has a slower PE. Does YHOO have more growth potential than Google? Now that AAPL has gone down to reasonable levels is it a better buy than YHOO. Again, when EVERYONE says buy there must be a contrarian case for selling to capture profits or shorting to anticipate a technical down trend. I have been wrong shorting to date. Who can add to the buy case ab ve and beyond what has been said already?

I'm guessing yours will come later in the day considering you broke the TOS every time you spoke yesterday. Whether you're serious or going to be condescending I'll answer anyway. I have no idea as the last 3 times its been random. I'll make maybe a dozen posts in leading up for them to send me it. Last time, I thought perhaps I had malware or a spybot or something as it hit my Hotmail too. My last post was saying that making fun of the Middle East situation wasn't right. Sent them emails all week...nothing. I then chatted with Customer Care online and they said my account was FINE, both times but needed to talk to the abuse team. Sunday or Monday rolls around and they tell me its deleted. They only release the reason by law and I'd gladly admit if I violated the TOS but the last 3 times I didn't, definitely not in the point leading up to it either. It goes in cycles too...in 09' it lasted all year then suddenly twice in the fall including one almost immediately. Its night and day since then though. Best guess is employee Coldone uses all of his ID's to report me as this board has moderators like no other. They used to give me a 999 error which was more or less a time-out but they're too lazy for that.

Thanks for the answer, but I really doubt I violated the TOS, and have never received any correspondence from Yahoo. My guess is your language is the main problem, and perhaps it is Coldone who uses that against you - I don't know. He knows I am no fan of his, but never had that contentious feud with him that you have. It is odd that he occasionally thought I was an alias of yours, when I was so clearly long at many times, and often disagreeing with you. Actually, what surprises me the most is that Yahoo actively monitors the board. Unfortunately, censorship limits what one can say, as I would like to not have to use code words such as "J-Tribe" and "The 2%," when many people don't know what that refers to, and would rather to be able to speak directly about who controls the media and why and how that power is abused, IMO, and of the nepotism and influence of wealth in our society that makes for a very uneven playing field. Sure can't honestly say your mind about the Middle East on many forums either. You know, people wouldn't be so against you here, if you admitted just once you were wrong, such as so often stating that YHOO the stock was forever stuck forever in a trading range. I still say it is all hindsight, and you were more lucky than good, assuming your claims of such great success in YHOO are true. I like Henry Ford's saying, "History is bunk." Things stay the same or repeat, UNTIL they change, which is inevitable. I have freely admitted here that believing in the Alibaba stake being monetized long ago, and/or a buyout, and continually picking up call options with my spare cash, is the worst financial mistake I ever made in my life. Well - maybe the second worst! :) We won't go into the other one. Well - I took a little time off from work yesterday, but back at it today - no more posting. Actually been very nice to be out of the stock market, as I consider it mostly a waste of time - but honestly going through a bit of withdrawl without any skin in the game.

APPL has many users now that they just need to leverage these millions users. With the many apple product out there including the upcoming AAPL TV, they will need to provide exclusive "content" or provide these "captured" million users or ecosystem automatic service product such as search, sports, entertainment, interests, mail, etc. AAPL buying YHOO accomplish these. We can visualize using our AAPL iphones, ipad or itv with AAPL providing whatever information or product we need via YHOO. Need search? YHOO has that; need sports info?

I wasn't too serious on you actually getting TOS'd as I'm at a different standard apparently. I've been wrong, a few times, batting something like 2 for 5 or 3 for 7, the times I HAVE been short in the last 5yrs in Yahoo. The short side is the trading side I need to work on most. I'm not saying a stock will stay literally in a trading range forever just historically stocks have similar tendencies that DON'T guarantee, a sure thing, just increased odds. Each TRADE, for me should be a return of 3:1 and 60-75% chance of success cause in the long-run I'll be ahead. That pertains to when using options...stocks are lower returns with a much longer horizon. Make money on one side and shove it in the other for long-term, divy stocks of late. If I was really golden, I would have got out early 2010' as it took more than 6mos. to get my double. I certainly can't pick an absolute bottom or top and it looks like my puts I wrote should have been at a higher strike price but I made a calculated risk it wouldn't bust $19/$20 in that timeframe. I may buy them back early and leave money on the table(time premium). I missed out on GMCR, doubling almost overnight, didn't think FB would recover like it has with all those shares outstanding but I don't dwell on it. Wondering if Netflix will go on another sky-high run...LEAPS on that could give one 10X return if right. The only thing I can do is try to find stocks that aren't 50:50 with odds in my favor...works then great, if not get out quickly. I'm not sure you mentioned your SECOND biggest mistake but it could be marriage as that is a wealth killer!lol As for Coldone, it his defense mechanism, when you call him out on a lie or multiple ID's he then says you too are in the same boat. I've outed his ID's years ago so what does he say...everyone else is me, you included. Disagree with him and you must be me. I suggested the one IP address to Customer Care, yet again, last week but doubt it'll change...some employee's have way too much fun on this board.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1354816136432</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 12:48:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354816617274-73</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL to BUY YAHOO, here are the reasons why...</Title><Username>stoxtxholdem</Username><Timestamp>1354815100114</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 12:31:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AAPL buying YHOO is not so farfetched.

I have had posts disappear or never get posted ... and don't know if that was active intervention or just system failures. Thanks for your interesting answer - nice to see you admit occasional failings. It would be great if you and Coldone would both agree to post no more about the past, and limit any disagreements as to what takes place in the stock from now on.

Owning Yahoo will get Yahoo and MSFT search plus Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Now Yahoo Japan and Alibaba (when Alibaba goes public) will have a cash value of $30 billion+ this will recoup almost half of their investment. So they will get NFLX with its exclusive Disney connection (that is why I believe Disney chose Netflix because they knew AAPL was in talks to take them over) and Yahoo search, etc.. with its Bing search for $30 billion or so. With their new tv coming out AAPL will want NFLX exclusively on it.. Maybe even a pay per view. AAPL can only design so much hardware and needs to introduce other products that will make them cash. They now need to be able to utilize all their hardware with residual monthly income. It may make Yahoo it's default page with Yahoo's new design. This is why I think AAPL has been selling off on leaks of the deal. Odd they sold off the exact amount of the purchase price over the last couple days (about $65 dollars or $65b) . This is why I believe GOOG maps were not included because they were in talks with Yahoo. They also want to steal traffic from GOOG. AAPL, Yahoo, and Netflix are a perfect trio to give GOOG a run for their money. I also believe MSFT may get in a bidding war for both of those companies but I believe AAPL has the deeper pockets.
