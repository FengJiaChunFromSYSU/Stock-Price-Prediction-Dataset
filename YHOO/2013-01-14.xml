Maybe, its Eric Jackson who too is getting whupped in Apple that is hurting Yahoo or perhaps Yahoo has stopped massively buying shares which it had IMO since mid-October to end of November. I'd be really surprised if Yahoo didn't drop $750M-$1B in the last quarter buying shares. Notice it has been around $19.50 for 5-6wks now? Why would he need funds? His hedge fund was up 32%, last year, and his Yahoo stake is up hundreds of millions. His PROFIT alone could have bought the HLF stake. I would like to thank Loeb as that short squeeze on Ackman is pretty sweet. I told you 2wks ago to get in if smart enough to figure out the ticker...up another 6% today and $8 even after telling you it was up 40%. I know you like to whine or hear yourself speak but some common sense would go a long way. You had to discuss the Yahoo Japan stake YET when Gloom gives you the TICKER you're too lazy to look it up. Why would you expect people to listen if too lazy to even do that? Sadly, I'm with Tethered on this one.

JAPAN is a mature company and will likely be able to maintain its position in most of the markets it operates in. Yahoo! JAPAN has a relatively diversified business, with its three largest operating segments contributing around 17% of its total value. We think that the firmâs growth will come from mobile advertising over the next few years as users substitute PCs for mobile devices for much of their content consumption. See our complete analysis of Yahoo! JAPAN here Mobile Advertising Platform Key For Growth According to our estimates, mobile advertising contributes approximately 17% to Yahoo ! JAPANâs total value, even though it made up for only around 7% of advertising revenues in 2012. We think that this division will be the biggest growth driver forYahoo ! JAPAN and estimate that around 15% of total revenues will be come from mobile advertising by 2015. Mobile Advertising Platform Key For Growth According to our estimates, mobile advertising contributes approximately 17% to Yahoo ! JAPANâs total value, even though it made up for only around 7% of advertising revenues in 2012. We think that this division will be the biggest growth driver forYahoo ! JAPAN and estimate that around 15% of total revenues will be come from mobile advertising by 2015. In our opinion, the primary growth driver in mobile ad revenues will be the increase in the number of page views on Yahoo! JAPANâs mobile ad platform. We think that monthly page views per unique visitor will increase from around 250 to approximately 550. This growth will be driven by an increase in smartphone penetration in Japan, which currently stands at a surprisingly low 15%. As this figure increases, more users will access web servicesvia mobile phones and is a trend that will benefit Yahoo! JAPAN. Another factor which will drive mobile ad revenues is the increase in mobile ad spending expected in the Japanese market. According to research firmeMarketer, mobile ad spending is expected to double and reach $2.6 billion by 2016. Due to this trend, we expect revenue per 1,000 page views to increase from approximately JPY 148 in 2012 to around JPY 215 by the end of our forecast period. Shopping &amp; Auctions Provide Solid Base According to our estimates, Yahoo ! JAPANâs eCommerce business is the biggest contributor to its value at around 18%. The division generated total revenues of approximately JPY 60 billion in 2012, and we expect total revenues from this division to increase slowly to around JPY 75 billion by the end of our forecast period. While Yahoo! JAPAN faces competition in this division from Japanese eCommerce giant Rakuten, we think that the firm will be able to capitalize on the increase in online spending by consumers. According to research firm Forrester, eCommerce sales are expected to grow over 50% from around JPY 4.9 trillion in 2012 to JPY 7.6 trillion in 2015. This growth will translate to an increase in the transaction value on both Yahoo! Auctions and Shopping, making this segment an important driver of Yahoo! JAPANâs value. We currently have a $14 price estimate for Yahoo! JAPAN, which is around 30% above the current market price.</Msg><Username>livefromnewyork1958</Username><Timestamp>1358180288389</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 11:18:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358181226564-42</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo!

It looks like you know when to pull the trigger thus you don't need other people's advice. You might want to buy more if Yahoo pull back to $18.50 or even lower but I don't know if it would pull back again like that. But I say hold it until $30 - $40 depends on when Alibaba is going IPO and how Yahoo core business is turning around. IMO, the core of Yahoo turning around is search, how to make Bing search better or selling Yahoo search to Facebook or Apple.</Msg><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1358186280970</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 12:58:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358186419905-56</Id><Topic><Title>Bernstein Raises Yahoo Price Target to $23</Title><Username>savior2911</Username><Timestamp>1357571620521</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 10:13:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bernstein is late to the party and the came empty handed.</Msg><Username>strumbollio</Username><Timestamp>1358186419905</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 13:00:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358189289819-57</Id><Topic><Title>AllThingsD Blasts Yahoo Wrongly Says Eric Jackson!</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1357862273139</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 18:57:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jackson will see to it that Swisher unfairly stops putting her negative twist on everything that has to do with Yahoo.</Msg><Username>strumbollio</Username><Timestamp>1358189289819</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 13:48:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358189322952-58</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo: Goldman Adds To Conviction Buy List; Target $24</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1355335937858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-12 13:12:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's what I thought.</Msg><Username>strumbollio</Username><Timestamp>1358189322952</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 13:48:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358189649849-59</Id><Title>How full of krap and always wrong is grey (and his aliases gloom and hotmodel) about YHOO and....</Title><Msg>.....just about everything he posts on.

But let me tell you, there is only one thing really important for Yahoo to do right now and right away. Let me tell you what it is: When I search "Yahoo" on Google, on the result page, I could always see a link called "News for Yahoo". If I click on that link, I am taken to all the latest news from all the major media sources about Yahoo. As I am a Yahoo investor, I would like to know all the important and latest news of Yahoo every morning. I also use this function to search NBA teams and stars that I like, I really enjoy reading news about them. I feel I am so refreshed and updated every morning with the news from the world everyday with Google search result. On the other hand, the search result of Bing is so outdated and disgusting, makes me want to vomit consider how much ads MSFT has put on the market for its so called "advanced" search - Bing! Yahoo is stupid enough to believe that as well. Google offers its users the ability to search all the latest news about the objects that people are really interested in and Yahoo and MSFT Bing search do not offer this function. I am not sure about other search users but at least for me, that's the most important reason I am only using Google search instead of Yahoo or MSFT Bing search. It makes me feel that it's so cool to use Google search and so dump to use Yahoo and MSFT Bing search and that's why I will never use Yahoo search although I am a Yahoo shareholder. If you were the CEO of Yahoo, believe it or not, urging MSFT Bing so add such an simple and yet really really important function is the only really important thing you should do right now and right away!!! I believe it would change the world and the fate of Yahoo which many people think is dead. One small thing could change the whole world, do you believe it? I do believe it! Maybe 10 years ago, when I first saw Google's home page, I thought it was so beautiful and I liked it! It was such a small new thing at that time but it made me feel so good! We all know what happened 10 years later, that beautiful small home page which was designed by our current Yahoo CEO - Marissa Mayer changed the world, Google becomes the search king and Yahoo is dying. Now it's time for Marissa Mayer to do the same thing again, Save Yahoo and change the world again!!! Good luck Yahoo and Marissa Mayer!!!</Msg><Username>yinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1358191871251</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:31:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358192048572-62</Id><Topic><Title>YHOO price target was raised at Needham to $26</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1356359311116</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 09:28:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One big story out of and it will jump to</Msg><Username>wbobeli</Username><Timestamp>1358192048572</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 14:34:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358194542210-63</Id><Topic><Title>How full of krap and always wrong is grey (and his aliases gloom and hotmodel) about YHOO and....</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1358189649849</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 13:54:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL I've only posted once today but since you worship me I'll post again!

It only exists the minds of the longs here. Why would Facebook go with Yahoo who controls only 12% of search when they could go with Googe who controls almost 67%? Facebook doesn't need Yahoo. They could do it on their own. Yahoo stock took one peak above #20 and then ran for cover. Now the longs here who missed the opportunity to sell it up there are hanging ther hat on all these wishful thinking ideas that give them a share price of $25, $30, $40 and even $50. They will be disappointed ion the short term as the correction is underway and we are headed back below $18. Could we eventually climb to those often quted lofy levels? Sure. But in the mean time we are going to test the stamina of the longs on the downside.

I agree and while its POSSIBLE I think its unlikely. Yahoo doesn't have a search engine, market share has imploded from its 20% it did have, and the whole point of Bartz getting into bed was to get their hands on Facebook's massive data on its users. Now, announced last week, Facebook got their hands on all of Google's search query data through a 3rd party. I didn't see it anywhere in the patent lawsuit that Facebook must choose Yahoo so why not go it alone or make a sweetheart deal with MSFT, which owns 5%, to cover the back-end stuff and subsidize for a period of time?</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1358210942516</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 19:49:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358211307922-87</Id><Topic><Title>Hotmodel - Do you still think Yahoo was dead money at $15.80?</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1354722516724</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 10:48:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hotmodel is nothing.</Msg><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1358211307922</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 19:55:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358211470356-88</Id><Topic><Title>The market does not seem to be too excited about the FB....</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1358206006352</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 18:26:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL I almost wish I was Wbobeli but alas I'm not!
