The last time this happened about a month laster there was a small mention on CNBC that 450000 yahoo accounts were hacked. Fess up Yahoo. They know there are being hacked from the Ukraine and where is the press release or notice to Yahoo users about this. The thread i put up yesterday was deleted. They pull in over 1.2B a year. After i am able to change my info on other accounts i will no longer visit yahoo and have been a user since day one. My contacts are getting sick of the bogus emailos sent from my account from the hackers in the Ukraine. If anyone out there thinks this company will be bought you may be right. But not at $15. Maybe $10. I have never messed with this stock but i had to short it this morning after the email hack again. I do the fantasy sports and use Yahoo daily but as i said after this week Yahoo is off my browser. I am not a paid pumper or dumper. Only think you should know what Yahoo will not tell you. Lets see how long yahoo allows this thread to stay. Good luck Guys......</Msg><Username>guttaman1</Username><Timestamp>1345473541795</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 10:39:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345474292670-6</Id><Topic><Title>Loeb/Third Point in 2 days down $100 million!</Title><Username>rlclark4</Username><Timestamp>1344981781722</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 18:03:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>stupid Loeb...</Msg><Username>blogoncloud</Username><Timestamp>1345474292670</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 10:51:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345474358964-7</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa can't speak for herself_ so X-Yahoo Krisnan spoke for her?</Title><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1345299111016</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 10:11:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>u should hear her laugh... go on Youtube and search 'Marissa mayer laugh'</Msg><Username>blogoncloud</Username><Timestamp>1345474358964</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 10:52:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345474481965-8</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa Mayer inexperienced as CEO</Title><Username>b2btrillionsayear</Username><Timestamp>1345212460801</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:07:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i doubt she's even a techie. probably just good at sales.

Let a geek be geek, she might not be an ideal CEO for a mature company like Yahoo..... but for a start-up she might be perfect- start up is all about product development less public interaction like media and wall street and investors. Look at how she handled the redeployment of capital and leave everyone hanging about her plan for acquisitions and product development..... while the stock got hit for 10%. A leader lead with vision not "guess what I am going to do next". She's been on the job for a month now, no clear mission statement, just free lunch for SURVIVING EMPLOYEES. Kind of like a last meal before execution. Marissa might make a good executioner and a tyrant.

Yes the BOD make a big mistake in hiring an inexperienced "virgin" CEO, who is pregnant, at a time when YHOO desperately needed stability, and experience, and had a great candidate in house in Levinsohn. The only answer now is to get YHOO sold to MSFT, AAPL, etc. Clearly she should not get rid of the baby but if she quits or is removed we will have our sixth CEO in a year. Hell at 5 in a year YHOO must already have the record for a bil $ plus company.</Msg><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1345515473771</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 22:17:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345515791593-47</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa neeeds to be told point blank by the BOD</Title><Username>jctuttle12</Username><Timestamp>1345513484518</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 21:44:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have never seen such sexist #$%$ and bias as i have witnessed on this message board for the past month.

To me Levinsohn looked like a much better candidate than Scott Thompson (what were they thinking there, that he could be a yes man to Yang and Bostock?) and after they made that clear mistake, why not go with the obvious choice and have Levinsohn just work to get YHOO sold ASAP for the most money. Now all YHOO has is doubt and uncertainty. YHOO sucks in so many ways! Just sell the company!</Msg><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1345521534388</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 23:58:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
