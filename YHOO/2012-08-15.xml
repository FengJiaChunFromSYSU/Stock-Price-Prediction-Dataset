I would venture to guess that since Marissa has an operational tech background, and media says that her hiring was due to her technical expertise and connection to the valley to get more people in, therefore it is very unlikely that her pitch was M&amp;A at all... she is essentially a glorified programmer whose salary demands for the top job were probably much lower than male candidates so yahoo board thought $70 million is cheap compared to what they would probably pay to woo a top male from silicon valley's boys club. She was by comparison, a cheap hire - still woefully expensive for the limitations of her skill set - no former experience as CEO, no experience in turnaround, no experience in M&amp;A and clearly no experience in PR, but plenty of experience in lamaze classes. Yahoo is stuck with her now, she is out of her league when it comes to handling the problems that beset yahoo. The stock will underperform while she is at the helms. Better hope Dan Loeb nudges her in the right direction and basically help her do her job, otherwise this stock is dead.</Msg><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1345019141292</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 04:25:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345021439889-9</Id><Title>Sorry, we encountered an error, please try again later.</Title><Msg>If that doesn't sum up Yahoo - I don't know what does.

Also didn't YHOO have to put up some investment for Y-Jap (and $1 bil cash and Y-China for AG) which should NOT be taxable? That is, for example, in the AG $7.1 bil- less $800 mil in pref. shares leaving $6.3 bil, then isn't only $5.3 bil (less even more for Y-China value) taxable at the 35%??

Yes it is worth much more of late because yjap trading near 52 week hi. In order for the deal to get done, YHOO will have to discount it a bit. This deal will get done soon IMO. They'll take a substantial chunk in assets to keep it tax free.</Msg><Username>johnberchick</Username><Timestamp>1345067730514</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 17:55:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345068264970-82</Id><Topic><Title>Is Marissa here to pave YHOO for acquisition BY Facebook?</Title><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1345066249384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 17:30:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FB will use its highly volatile stock to load up YHOO's cash galore of $16.5 Billion : 1- YHOO cash $2 Bil 2- ALibaba 2 chunks of $4.5Bil in 2012 + $5.5 Bil in 2014 IPO 3- Yahoo Japan $4.5 Bil in 2013 Give back to shareholders $1.5 Bil as token gesture from King Loeb to the peasant stockholders. FB will have $15 Billion CASH and issue bunch of worthless stock paper to YHOO stockholders. WHY WOULDNT ZUCK salivate at YHOO?! Of course 40% premium of September xx date closing price of $18 to $20. Loeb gets a chunk of FB with collars to protect himself. The rest of us get down on our knees and get screwed holding FB highly dilutive stocks. Marissa walks away w Loeb laughing at "stockholders". May be I need to convert to Judaism so I can write these deals and take away billions.</Msg><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1345068264970</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 18:04:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345068436257-83</Id><Topic><Title>Eric Jackson (Mr. $41/share, whom has little credibility left) puts Y-Jap value in M Fool article at only....</Title><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1345049726522</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 12:55:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is Y-Jap's market value now?? I think around $20 bil. How much would YHOO have to discount? Perhaps not much. Who is the second potential buyer of Y-Jap after Softbank?

Yahoo keeps all 6 billion. Dan Loeb owns a huge chunk now, why would he wants to distribute that wealth? If he does, it will run Yahoo share price up and it will make the acquisition tougher. Drive down the price, make a bid for $22/share, take Yahoo private. He then pockets 6 billion dollars, which means 30billion minus 6billion, means he only paid $17 dollars per share for the entire Yahoo. Then he breaks apart the company. 1) Remaining of the Alibaba (15 billion); 2) Yahoo Japan (7 billion); 3) Core business (sell it MSFT for 15 billion). He buys Yahoo for 17 billion dollars and doubles the money. Not sure if all the numbers are right, but you get what I am saying. ONly a Private Yahoo can be broken up and sold effectively. Dan Loeb can get this done. Meanwhile, we only get a slight premium.... oh well.</Msg><Username>fpl1971</Username><Timestamp>1345071804822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 19:03:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345072027871-89</Id><Title>What has it been, 3 weeks?</Title><Msg>Isn't it time for a new CEO at YHOO?</Msg><Username>augustbroker</Username><Timestamp>1345072027871</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 19:07:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345073452000-90</Id><Title>Keep trying bashers!
