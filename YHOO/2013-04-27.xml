Ballmer is a fool, much like Dr ("AG only worth 1 bil.") Gloom, Grey and hotmodel ("sell YHOO at $14") are on this board. But they have lost actual money on YHOO while Ballmer just lost opportunity for MSFT.</Msg><Username>dariencat8</Username><Timestamp>1367063720884</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 07:55:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367077700255-2</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT or AAPL would look stupid to now buy YHOO for what would have to be over $30 or even $35 now when they....</Title><Username>dariencat8</Username><Timestamp>1367063720884</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 07:55:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Where did I say "sell YHOO at $14"? I know you're an idiot and all but I WROTE options making me a synthetic long with the LOWEST PRICE OF THE YEAR!!! Then I took that money UP FRONT and shoved half of it into Netflix. How has Netflix did...$65 to $217, making me contemplate retiring completely. Aren't you the idiot who called for $22? Used another ID calling for $20? Even though if you just bought the calls as it rose you'd have made money? All of my trades in Yahoo have made money including my short from $22.90 to $22 was perfect, 35% return. My long position from $22's to $24.68 is up a few bucks. For a guy who dumped in the $19's, months ago, why are you even here? That includes your other ID's Shashag,Texassucksbig, KLMDSI, Bushworstprezever, and Mewag. NO ONE IS BUYING YAHOO!!! Apple is giving $100B to SHAREHOLDERS, MSFT grew FASTER than Yahoo by far, last quarter. AG isn't available to an acquirer as a thing called "right to first refusal" comes into play. The core is still in the toilet and considering Yahoo has bought 200M shares its the equivalent of $20, in 09'...nothing to write home about. Want my autograph??? You have to otherwise to make a topic to WHINE is weird.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1367077700255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 11:48:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367079155815-3</Id><Title>Somebody is setting up a Twittometer for different topics - cool</Title><Msg>See tweet of Therese Hansen 1h I really should wait to share this, because it isn't ready, but this is a sneak peek into what we are making next</Msg><Username>left2rightdoor</Username><Timestamp>1367079155815</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 12:12:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367079273499-4</Id><Topic><Title>YHOO front page worse than the ENQUIRE rag !!!!!!</Title><Username>ny.golf</Username><Timestamp>1367014569681</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 18:16:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only real standard of good taste is NY Post (or Sun, if you're Brit)</Msg><Username>mesondk</Username><Timestamp>1367079273499</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 12:14:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367079381953-5</Id><Topic><Title>Why Yahoo Is Worth $34</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1367008387880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 16:33:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Considering the high growth expected from the US Internet industry, we can value Yahoo with a p/e of 25, which gives us a target price of $30. Therefore Yahoo! has an upside of 30% at current valuations making the stock a strong buy. Facebook and Google are still the best bet in the Internet advertisement industry but for investors looking for a high-risk, high-return play, Yahoo! is the way to go.</Msg><Username>strumbollio</Username><Timestamp>1367079381953</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 12:16:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367081487749-6</Id><Topic><Title>Why Yahoo Is Worth $34</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1367008387880</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 16:33:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With MM is at the helm of YHOO, the core business will finally get into sustainable growth and I strongly believe that. I am confident she will be successful. With a PE of 7 now, say going to PE 15, watch $30 to $40 per YHOO share, the Asian assets are the icing of the cake.</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1367081487749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 12:51:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367094330648-7</Id><Topic><Title>My Letter to Arbys</Title><Username>luckyflip24</Username><Timestamp>1367026386523</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 21:33:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah! And what a Spam sandwich??? Fried extra crispy. Spam is the use of electronic messaging systems to send unsolicited bulk messages, especially advertising, indiscriminately. While the most widely recognized form of spam is e-mail spam, the term is applied to similar abuses in other media. And if You add PORK to this , You get real SPAM.
