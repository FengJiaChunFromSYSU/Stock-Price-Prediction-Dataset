So Yahoo, what retirement benefits do you provide your own employees? We know Yahoo rakes in about $13 billion annually but not a cent goes to the common share holder.

What ever the "dividend" is one can expect the price to drop proportionately, hence no real gain for the shareholders. What does it do for the company, outside of satisfy folks who are looking to cash out, it really does nothing. In contrast, if you buy back shares with the money the pps should rise proportionately, and if you invest it wisely (like the Alibaba investment in the first place) you will gain net value for the company. It seems to me that those wanting the cash dividend are simply trying to cash out but don't want to sell their shares/ This makes no sense. If you thing yahoo is going nowhere then simply sell and move on (you can move sideways with a dividend with MSFT (little risk) or you can bet on apple contining its upward flight, you can bet on gold, or you can simply hold cash. If yahoo has a future (and recent history leaves this a major question mark) then it should invest to grow not through the money to the wind!!!!</Msg><Username>firsttestcase</Username><Timestamp>1344870175015</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:02:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344870624090-18</Id><Title>10 years of nothiing, and no WHERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11</Title><Msg>History of yahoo, is never do anything RIGHT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>yanksgiantsjoe</Username><Timestamp>1344870624090</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:10:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344870990210-19</Id><Topic><Title>What's with YHOO's BOD and CEO?</Title><Username>augustbroker</Username><Timestamp>1344863019157</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 09:03:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How many more CEOs WILL THERE BE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>yanksgiantsjoe</Username><Timestamp>1344870990210</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:16:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344871202925-20</Id><Title>Plus Ca Change . . .</Title><Msg>New B of D with great creds.

You should care about how the money is used unless you have no interest in Yahoo or hold a short position and want to see it drop further. If you honestly feel that sending out cash dividents is what is best for a company fine. Now, if they had 40 billion and had no idea what to do with the money then fine, trim the holdings and distribute some funds. But, yahoo needs to find its identity and get itself kickstarted. AND the have resources that had been locked up with which to do it. So do something constructive with the money!!! IMO, the market overreacted. Why would any honest person downgrade Yahoo at this point, particularly after the market reaction. They still have ALL of the assets, and they have a new CEO who needs to have the flexibility to make wise decisions. I think it is a sign that they have a CEO who can think.</Msg><Username>firsttestcase</Username><Timestamp>1344871343828</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:22:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344871594253-24</Id><Topic><Title>Loeb backs Yahoo's Alibaba cash move - source</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1344620940581</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 13:49:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mayer and Loeb will turn Yahoo into a Giant.</Msg><Username>smedleypuddles</Username><Timestamp>1344871594253</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:26:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344871644665-25</Id><Topic><Title>10 years of nothiing, and no WHERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11</Title><Username>yanksgiantsjoe</Username><Timestamp>1344870624090</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:10:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sideways markets can last a generation</Msg><Username>metalmeister79</Username><Timestamp>1344871644665</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:27:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344871695870-26</Id><Topic><Title>$15.15 Worst BOD of all time-Anybody</Title><Username>reebok77</Username><Timestamp>1344856832491</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 07:20:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Make that $14 soon.</Msg><Username>fjc35</Username><Timestamp>1344871695870</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:28:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344872206259-27</Id><Title>2 hours into trading 13,000 $15 Sept calls JUMPING in VOLUME</Title><Msg>Smart $$$ loading up like Daniel Loeb + Marissa's friends.</Msg><Username>evilwallstreet</Username><Timestamp>1344872206259</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:36:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344872839765-28</Id><Topic><Title>Swisher's Claim Of Morse Leaving Verified</Title><Username>mb525799</Username><Timestamp>1344812587548</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 19:03:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Loeb and Mayer will hire the best CFO available.</Msg><Username>smedleypuddles</Username><Timestamp>1344872839765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:47:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344873875099-29</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba Group Holdings has plans for an IPO in the works</Title><Username>cul8eral</Username><Timestamp>1344868552304</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 10:35:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is no timetable for the group’s IPO,” said Zheng Ming, the group’s chief strategy officer at a press conference. “As for the year 2015 mentioned in our agreement with Yahoo, it may be a time that both sides feel reasonable."</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1344873875099</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:04:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344874094482-30</Id><Topic><Title>Alibaba Group Holdings has plans for an IPO in the works</Title><Username>cul8eral</Username><Timestamp>1344868552304</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 10:35:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Alibaba Group will IPO in 2013.</Msg><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1344874094482</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:08:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344874118396-31</Id><Title>I am convinced</Title><Msg>Yahoo exists just to make new CEO's very wealthy before they get terminated.

Heck no! From the start it was obvious that she intends to build Yahoo into her vision of the company, not sit back as a caretaker CEO handing out cash like Yahoo is some type of REIT. The capital return to shareholders was part of the Levinsohn and Morse Interim CEO deal. Once that ended in an Outsiders hire as CEO, and especially as the architect of that deal left. (With the CFO not far behind it seems) no one should have been surprised at what happened. I am not so surprised that longs posting here were caught off guard, they've been caught off guard for years by Yahoo's moves. It is all of the professional investors that didn't see this coming that amazes me. When it comes to Yahoo, always do the opposite of what conventional wisdom says and you will profit.</Msg><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1344878976945</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:29:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344880072650-38</Id><Title>Why did Loeb pull the carpet under Yahoo?</Title><Msg>He had to know what would happen without a plan.</Msg><Username>gogostocks123</Username><Timestamp>1344880072650</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:47:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344880190567-39</Id><Title>Anybody feel that maybe the cash will be used to take Yahoo private?</Title><Msg>I thought that Yang wanted that from day 1</Msg><Username>gogostocks123</Username><Timestamp>1344880190567</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:49:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344880451780-40</Id><Topic><Title>2 hours into trading 13,000 $15 Sept calls JUMPING in VOLUME</Title><Username>evilwallstreet</Username><Timestamp>1344872206259</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:36:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why are so many September $16 calls volume?

The employees lie to the managers; the managers lie to the board of directors; everybody lies to the shareholders. Since nobody expects to be around very long, nobody expects to be called to account and nobody is. I have email going back several years from Customer Care, various managers and even two former board members stating that they are very concerned about the serial spam on the message boards and they are only months away from implementing a new computer program that will stop it. They all lied. They are still issuing unlimited ID's to serial spammers who try to steal from Yahoo users and even reported spam messages are not being deleted. We just elected a new board of directors based on the statement that assets would be sold and money returned to shareholders. Instead, they hired a young, ambitious CEO. Although it has yet to be proven, I'm guessing they lied as well. Some companies know that truth and fair play works - my exprience with Amazon, Apple and even American Express is quite good. Some companies really need a cultural shift. Like Yahoo. Unfortunately, I don't see it happening.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1344897027324</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 18:30:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344899295162-65</Id><Title>Question: Will Yahoo Buy Zynga ?</Title><Msg>Anyone !
