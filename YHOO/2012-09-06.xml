I would like to ask Yahoo why Obama cancelled his speech at an outdoor stadium over weather when there was a 18% chance of rain? Real reason was that they were unable to give away enough tickets to fill a 75000 seat stadium so they are moving to a 20000 seat stadium instead for Obama's Thursday night speech. No mention of it on Yahoo.</Msg><Username>gkcreamcheese</Username><Timestamp>1346907590417</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 00:59:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346907704188-2</Id><Topic><Title>YAHOO CENSORING MESSAGES CRITICIZING NEW MESSAGE BOARD FORMAT?</Title><Username>market_logic2010</Username><Timestamp>1346887460999</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 19:24:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In other words it went from a "USEFUL" format to a "USELESS" format!</Msg><Username>cancel190</Username><Timestamp>1346907704188</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 01:01:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346907740078-3</Id><Topic><Title>Total Message postings seem to have sharply declined with the new format</Title><Username>market_logic2010</Username><Timestamp>1346894451954</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 21:20:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They've changed the message board format 3 or 4 times since I've been using yahoo (mid 90s) and none of them have been for the better.</Msg><Username>gedownonit24me</Username><Timestamp>1346907740078</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 01:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346908457074-4</Id><Topic><Title>someone knows something...</Title><Username>kenrsmith2003</Username><Timestamp>1346873884535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 15:38:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if they COMPLETED a deal with yahoo-japan why would they hold off advising stockholders until the first payment from alibaba? that doesn't make sense to me since they have an obligation to stockholders to notify them!

The answer from recently-installed Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has been a clear no, according to company executives. “We see it as a core element to being a successful, global Internet company,” Michael Barrett, Yahoo’s chief revenue officer, said of the advertising technology. “It’s not coincidental that Marissa’s a big fan of ad technology, she worked on it herself at Google for many years,” he added. Barrett said keeping Yahoo’s advertising technology in-house will enable it to be “more facile” as buying patterns among advertisers change.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1346936129525</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 08:55:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346936984502-20</Id><Topic><Title>YAHOO CENSORING MESSAGES CRITICIZING NEW MESSAGE BOARD FORMAT?</Title><Username>market_logic2010</Username><Timestamp>1346887460999</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 19:24:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>new format often gives you this response: Error while retrieving the data or They hide the 'reply button'.</Msg><Username>stockcrazi</Username><Timestamp>1346936984502</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:09:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346937117433-21</Id><Topic><Title>YAHOO CENSORING MESSAGES CRITICIZING NEW MESSAGE BOARD FORMAT?</Title><Username>market_logic2010</Username><Timestamp>1346887460999</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 19:24:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IHUB or Motley Fool is raging bull still operational? their are plenty of boards..and a whole lot faster then replying on this one!</Msg><Username>lescrockett2</Username><Timestamp>1346937117433</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 09:11:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346937791478-22</Id><Title>Just how much better was the CV result?</Title><Msg>Did I miss that?

There are still internal spammers reposting their msgs via cut and paste on various boards. E.g., check out all the DuPont (DD) related msgs by funfundvierzig reposted on the boards for DOW, HUN, PPG, SHW, SMG, SYT... The problems are compounded by the "new and improved" (NOT!)

They don't understand that the retail investors in normal course of business don't even move a needle, it's the big boys on the street who move stocks. Only time retail investors make a difference is when there is a news item - which could happen in next couple of weeks - and that's when I suspect many of these shorts will loose their shorts. :-)</Msg><Username>hello_midwest</Username><Timestamp>1346956968874</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 14:42:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346957189475-63</Id><Title>Market, MSFT, GOOG, etc. all up huge while YHOO is on the floor!

I just spoke with YHOO corp investor relations and they advised me that share repurchases were nonpublic information and they had no comment on the subject. I called to see if they were as stupid as you indicated they were! They were not stupid! So Michan59 if you will provide me , the board, the name of the person addressing your inquiry, we will get to the bottom of the matter. If you fail to respond, we can safely assume your a total fraud, and likely short YHOO. I was advised that the share repurchase information would be made available in conjunction with the quarterly reporting. Give us a name! I want blood! Yours or anyones. I have been in the markets for over 50 years and fully understand share repurchases and corporate responsibility. What you posted was totally contrary to any responsible corporate action. Remember YHOO has your IP address and if your not working for Loeb and trying to pass disinformation, your very likely claiming insider information and disclosing it, in either case, I can rely on a complaint to the SEC to resolve the matter. I have posted that YHOO was buying stock based on public information of order flow and buyers representative, I will stand behind my posts that YHOO will have bought in close to 200 million shares when they release their report in mid Oct. And they will still have plenty of cash to buy Path and Yelp, if they so desire, which I hope they do attempt.</Msg><Username>goldeagle14</Username><Timestamp>1346957297671</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 14:48:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346957506354-65</Id><Topic><Title>"IF IT A'INT BROKE, FIX IT"</Title><Username>market_logic2010</Username><Timestamp>1346894932438</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 21:28:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another yahoo motto.

My colleagues exited our yahoo board quickly for another site - just fed up with the changes. I did however, find a way to paste 'text' rather than a link for posters to cross check information but it was too late for the others on my board. Also, Yahoo did delete several of my messages with no apparent reason to do so. Very frustrating. The new board does not make up for the ease with which we were able to use Yahoo boards. I suspect Yahoo will be the biggest loser with the loss of advertisers along with the loss of posters.

See my earlier posts. The YHOO Japan deal is no where in sight and I guess old 99 just made that up and tossed it in sort of like a salad where you clean out all the old veggies in your refridg!

Sure, it’s been left to die on the vine even though it was once the dominant photo sharing service. But it’s still a great service that can be returned to even rival Instagram. And the best part of it? Yahoo! spent $60 million for it 7 years ago instead of a billion! I expect she’s given the Flickr team its marching orders already: “Be the dominant photo sharing service again in a year! I don’t care what it takes. Just do it. The Instagram guys have 13 people and haven’t innovated in their product for 18 months. It’s just a bunch of cutesy filters and out-of-focus features that you can easily tweet. We can replicate that in 60 days and then out-innovate the hell out of them in the 60 days after that.” And watch for iOS PhotoStream integration here folks.
