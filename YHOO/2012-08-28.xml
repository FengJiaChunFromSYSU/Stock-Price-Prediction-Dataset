Many, many shareholders waiting for 15s to sell but that won't happen. They get more and more desperate and will sell when they recognize that the SP is falling and falling. It's all about psychology and really easy to trade. Buy shorts and cover at 14,2 or even lower.</Msg><Username>p_walther</Username><Timestamp>1346181132012</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:12:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346181457071-82</Id><Topic><Title>Use twitter instead of posting here...$yhoo $spy $ggp</Title><Username>baxter_saxter</Username><Timestamp>1346172122845</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 12:42:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes that sounds like a good idea....I am not sure I have ever seen so many complaints...and the company response is like they just do not care....Obviously somebody is going to lose there job over this...I think it will become more of a story next by next week as more boards get switched over.</Msg><Username>phennes591</Username><Timestamp>1346181457071</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:17:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346182034715-83</Id><Title>Yahoo Destroying It's Own Monopoly In Message Boards</Title><Msg>You know it is tough to do...But I think Yahoo is attempting to destroy it's own monopoly position in business message boards....They basically have no other real competition...Hard to believe!!!</Msg><Username>phennes591</Username><Timestamp>1346182034715</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:27:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346182261303-84</Id><Title>YHOO option IV popping a bit</Title><Msg>sept puts and calls getting a bit more expensive in the last hour.

Given she worked there just a month ago and that both companies compete directly isn't this consider wrong? All Google employees coming knows exactly what Google did, is doing or will be doing going forward. I can understand if MM attracts talent from other places due to her contacts but inviting Google folks sounds too unethical and unprofessional to me. Also she is totally inexperienced to be CEO as she has never ever been one in her life. If Carl Icahn and others can't make this stock rise in last 5 yrs despite several seasoned CEO's like Carol Bartz, Terry Semel, etc I don't know how much Marissa Mayer would be able to do given her lack of finance &amp; business operations knowledge imho.
