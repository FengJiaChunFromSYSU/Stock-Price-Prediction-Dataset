What does it do??? It will pre-read an article I click or post here to see if it makes sense or is dumb then will block it. Come across, a sports blogger writing about the Kardashians...POOF! its gone. Do you know how huge it is since Yahoo changed their privacy policy to stalk you with cookies on their front page? Since I don't have a working algo yet I'll sell it for $20M...$21M so $1M can go to actually making working product.

As for crying, you're going to look mighty #$%$ if Yahoo doesn't dump Bing(I don't think they will) won't you? They'll simply make MSFT cut a check longer instead of spending $1B+ to get back into the game. They'll work WITH MSFT to improve it as it benefits both.

Yahoo is a fine media company and has done VERY WELL over the last three years...as long as their core business of selling ads continues they are a good, stable investment (IF ONLY DIVIDENDS).</Msg><Username>stockscouter9000</Username><Timestamp>1364595275311</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 18:14:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364597057779-68</Id><Title>You longs are messing with the greatest shorts on earth!</Title><Msg>It's called averaging. Sure it's up since the "so called bottom", but shorts are smart! They know it's going to a buck! Do you know that 14.50 to 1.00 is like over a 90% gain!? So, averaging in and building a position on the short side could make you absolutely rich!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you have a half million dollars short you could have almost 1 million bucks b4 it's all said and done! That is serious change!</Msg><Username>chartsrock</Username><Timestamp>1364597057779</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 18:44:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364597117232-69</Id><Title>Apr 4, 2013: FB will buy Bing...</Title><Msg>and will search agreement with Yahoo!</Msg><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1364597117232</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 18:45:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364597588261-70</Id><Topic><Title>Hotmodel has joined Coldone's Army of Longs</Title><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1364573895776</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 12:18:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have an obsession in a made up world.
