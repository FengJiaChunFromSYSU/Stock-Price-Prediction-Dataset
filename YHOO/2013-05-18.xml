Double standard??? Not once in my "arguing" with SoDumbKid do I bring you up? Not once have I wondered where my protector BasketWeaving is to save the day and if not call them a loser.LMAO Its ridiculous in what you're asking! We're NOT dating and I don't owe you anything much less stick up for you in a discussion I'M NOT IN!!! Fight YOUR battles is the strangest request I've ever seen. SMDH! I don't even talk to you so have no idea where this "truly awful" stuff comes from. What I call SoDumbKid, its cause he's earned it talking #$%$ and lying.

Its the simpletons defense mechanism, when you out his ID's and instead of admitting to it he simply accuses you of doing the same. As for it being odd...why cause he found out what irritates you and you keep playing into his hand? The guy has said I'm short 95% of the time, flips it to being the same then back to short all the while wrong. If he's typing he's lying so just laugh as I do. I'm not twisting ANY words...you today called me a loser and your reply was not defending you. At no point should have I been mentioned in YOUR argument!

A normal human would have left me out of the conversation and certainly wouldn't have accused me for something I'm not.

What most people misunderstand about Tumblr, and what Yahoo may feel is worth paying for, is that Tumblr is NOT best described as a "blogging platform." Sure, users have blogs on which they post things. But once you're a Tumblr user, you find that the real fun of Tumblr is building a news feed that only you can see from other users you like. Want an all-skateboarding-all-the-time news feed? Tumblr. As members begin to follow each other, they start messaging each other. The real party on Tumblr is going on behind the dashboard, not on the blogs' outer faces. That party is why Tumblr has become so big among young people — it's basically a cool social hangout that their parents haven't figured out yet. Tumblr's dashboard feeds are obviously easy to monetize in the future, just as Facebook and Instagram's friend feeds are and will be. Which is why $1 billion suddenly doesn't seem completely crazy for a $13 million startup.

Yahoo may have to significantly increase the offer to close the deal. An acquisition by some tech giant is likely in the cards for Tumblr, though, as sources say the company only has a few months of cash runway left. The news comes after AllThingsD reported Yahoo was in advanced talks to buy Tumblr for $1.1 billion cash, and the portal’s board of directors are set to meet on Sunday night to discuss the potential deal. Forbes reports that Facebook and Microsoft have also expressed interest in acquiring Tumblr. However, Forbes says that Yahoo has lock-up agreement arranged with Tumblr that prevents the blogging platform from holding a “bake-off” or bidding war for the right to buy it. If Yahoo comes to the table with an insufficient offer, which our sources say $1.1 billion qualifies as, Tumblr may be able to reject it and shop itself around some more. A few months ago Tumblr let several companies know it was interested in possibly being acquired. Yahoo was the first to come to the table with a firm number, says one of our sources. They say Tumblr is apprehensive about accepting the $1.1 billion cash offer, though. Considering the much smaller, younger Instagram’s acquisition price was supposed to be $1 billion (in cash and stock, though, which would eventually make it worth less), it seems reasonable that Tumblr would view $1.1 billion cash as a lowball. Tumblr employees have been told that the company only has enough funds to operate for a few more months, as its costs far exceed the limited revenue it earns. Tumblr pulled in $13 million in 2012, but has accelerated its advertising offering in hopes of hitting $100 million in revenue this year. The money’s not coming in fast enough to support its expenses though. Employees were recently told not to be concerned, though, because the company is expecting to be bought. Of course, Yahoo might be able to push the deal through for $1.1 billion or just a little more depending on how the acquisition is structured. If it promises Tumblr’s CEO David Karp he can retain control of the company, provides the right retention bonuses, or won’t force Tumblr to shoehorn in integrations with Yahoo’s other properties, Tumblr may be more receptive. If Yahoo successfully buys the startup, it could inject some much-needed “cool,” youthful energy, and design sense into the aging tech giant. The acquisition might not be so popular with Tumblr’s users, though, who range from young hipsters to diehard Internet aficionados. Many thought Instagram’s user base would balk at its acquisition by Facebook, but the photo sharing service has continued to grow, offering some hope to Yahoo and Tumblr if their deal closes.</Msg><Username>warnerlambert</Username><Timestamp>1368896295611</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 12:58:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368896412999-59</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo To Announce Tumblr Buyout Monday</Title><Username>neo1278alpha</Username><Timestamp>1368846208408</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 23:03:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>W.

Tumblr And Yahoo: Latest Details On The Imminent Deal SHARE: Soon-to-be quarter-billionaire David Karp. (Image credit: Getty Images via @daylife) By the end of this weekend, Tumblr founder David Karp will most likely be $250 million richer and Yahoo founder Marissa Mayer will be able to say she outmaneuvered her old friends at Google, not to mention Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft. Yahoo’s board will meet Sunday to vote on a $1.1 billion offer the company has put forth for Tumblr, the six-year-old social blogging platform. Details of the offer were first reported by All Things D; I’ve independently confirmed them with sources close to the proceedings and learned a few additional facts. The meeting had to happen fast because an agreement that gives Yahoo the exclusive right to negotiate one-on-one with Tumblr is set to expire in just a few days. Were that window to close without a deal, the Tumblr derby could turn into a real free-for all. In addition to Facebook and Microsoft, two companies that I reported earlier have held talks with Tumblr, I’ve also learned that Google and Twitter have made approaches in recent weeks. In fact, it was an expression of interest from Google, which was looking to possibly make an investment in or acquire the company, that set off the furious round of tire-kicking that culminated in Yahoo’s bid. While there’s been some speculation that another party could still emerge with a better offer, it’s pretty unlikely at this point. Tumblr’s board, which includes representatives from Union Square Ventures, Spark Capital and Sequoia Capital, has already voted to approve Yahoo’s offer. Given Yahoo’s large war chest from the sale of its Alibaba stake and the relatively free hand Mayer enjoys as a new CEO, it’s expected that her board will go along willingly as well. For a third party to derail the deal, then, would require an extraordinarily aggressive gesture, on the order of Mark Zuckerberg calling up Karp and promising him hundreds of millions more. No one’s expecting that. Inside Tumblr, the thinking is that Yahoo’s offer is likely to be as good as it gets because none of other big players need what Tumblr offers — its youth, its growth, its high levels of mobile engagement — quite so badly. On Friday afternoon, Tumblr had its regular weekly all-hands meeting at its Manhattan headquarters. Naturally, someone asked Karp about the sale reports. Karp — who is believed to own more than 20% of Tumblr’s equity — downplayed them, promising employees that they would be the first to know any big news.</Msg><Username>warnerlambert</Username><Timestamp>1368907539159</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 16:05:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368907693645-77</Id><Topic><Title>What is the symple for tumblr</Title><Username>ddcnagi</Username><Timestamp>1368884500519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 09:41:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You simply don't get it do you?</Msg><Username>warnerlambert</Username><Timestamp>1368907693645</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 16:08:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368908009679-78</Id><Topic><Title>What Do Disheartened FaceBook Investors Do Knowing Yahoo Snags Tumblr?</Title><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1368903341497</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 14:55:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks...I'll score that as "most probably" which on my old analytic/prediction scale was below "almost certainly" but above "probably".

Always the sign of low intelligence and to think you were the one calling me not smart. This will not grow revenue's in the billions to justify it nor will "synergy" make it worthwhile. Blogging is the most worthless activity possible and has peaked. The worst content on this planet. Directly responsible for the dumbing down of America...must be why you like it so much eh? Why do you think business people can jump companies and succeed? They know dollars and cents to make a profit. This "vision" will get her fired in the next 3yrs! Its no different then Geocities, a decade ago. Quick name me a Yahoo acquisition in the past decade that has succeeded...they're the OPPOSITE of Midas. Since you're not too bright Midas, was a king in Greek Mythology that everything he touched turned to gold. Yahoo turns things into lead metaphorically speaking.

From my tumblr perspective, I am not excited about this deal. In fact, if they make a single change to the platform I will completely drop it, like I did FB a few years back. From an investors perspective, I don't like companies that overpay for a company whose real revenue is really jsut plain silly and even questionable. If social media investments were soooo good, then facebook would not be trading below its IPO price, it would be at all time highs.

What I find interesting is that in Sept/11, they received 85million in a round that included Richard Branson, Greylock etc.. It brought them a lot of attention &amp; they were valued at that time around 800 million. I see in Nov/12 there was talk about Tumblr about to get another round of funding - which would value them at 1 Billion, but I don't see that they actually ever received that round of funding. So a year and half ago they were already valued at 800 million &amp; they had negligible revenue. I guess you're worth what someone is willing to pay you (~~,</Msg><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1368934165901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 23:29:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368934300303-134</Id><Topic><Title>why would yahoo get into the laundromat business??</Title><Username>jimibeam99</Username><Timestamp>1368933686009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 23:21:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are a lot of dirty clothes out there Jimmy a lot.
