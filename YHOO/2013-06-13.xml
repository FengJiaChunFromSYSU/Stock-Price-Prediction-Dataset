Remember the good old “cash-rich split” idea from a few years ago? Why is no one considering that this could be utilized now? At current prices, Wall Street is pricing in that Yahoo will pay full taxes and fees on any disposal of its Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes. If they were able to structure either as a tax-efficient deal, you’re talking about billions of dollars in savings (like an extra $9 billion possibly). There could be some interesting assets coming back to Yahoo as part of such a deal too. At the moment, Steve Ballmer is feeling the pressure from Value Act to further rationalize Microsoft (MSFT). What happens if he decides he wants to throw Bing into a “cash-rich split” transaction between Yahoo! and either Alibaba or Yahoo Japan? Recall that one-third of the value Yahoo! would get back for disposing of their $10 billion Yahoo Japan stake or $20 billion Alibaba stake (at an $80 billion valuation for Alibaba) has to come back to them in the form of “other assets.” What if Bing was a part of that – making Yahoo suddenly a natural search partner for Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft also benefiting from being able to say they’re further focusing?</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1371100355845</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 01:12:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371105323492-2</Id><Topic><Title>The good old “cash-rich split”</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1371100355845</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 01:12:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nonsense.

Funny I oould not find this news article on Yahoo "news" but Yahoo homepage had news about some old actresses' diet. Former Justice Department prosecutor Larry Klayman filed a federal class-action lawsuit Wednesday against the nine companies named in a top-secret National Security Agency document published June 6 as partners in the NSA's PRISM Internet surveillance program. The lawsuit seeks $20 billion in damages and attorney fees and an injunction ending the highly controversial program that began in 2007. In addition to the nine companies named in a leaked NSA slideshow as providing government investigators direct, real-time access to their servers – AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, PalTalk, Skype, Yahoo! and YouTube – the lawsuit targets the CEOs of each company, the telecom companies AT&amp;T and Sprint and their CEOs, President Barack Obama, Attorney General Eric Holder, NSA director Keith Alexander, the Department of Justice and the NSA. Each of the nine companies has denied knowledge of, or participation in, the PRISM program. There are three named plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday: Charles Strange, a Pennsylvania father whose son Michael, a Navy SEAL Team VI member, died in Afghanistan in 2011, and California private investigators Michael Ferrari and Matt Garrison. "Defendants' willful acts constitute outrageous conduct insofar as they violated Plaintiffs' and Class members' basic democratic rights, constitutional rights, and exposed them to beyond an 'Orwellian regime of totalitarianism,'" the lawsuit says. "Plaintiffs' and Class members' rights are being surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence and other government agencies, as well as all of the Defendants."</Msg><Username>fishnman1973</Username><Timestamp>1371111667865</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 04:21:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371112475408-6</Id><Title>Yahoo blocked newslink I posted about the $20B lawsuit against it</Title><Msg>WARNING!!!!

The company has plenty of cash to make a billion dollar bid after selling half of its take in Alibaba for around $7 billion. While it has been using that cash to make small acquisitions, it also just inked a billion dollar deal to buy Tumblr. Tumblr, a photo and media focused blog site, is a much better fit than Hulu would be. Not only does Yahoo! already have experience in the photo space, but the service doesn't come with legacy baggage. While new CEO Marissa Mayer has been deftly using acquisitions to further her turnaround effort, Hulu would pull the company off on a tangent. And the content providers who currently own Hulu would likely balk if she tried to turn the service into a more modern product by killing ads, increasing content, or trying to make content more timely. Yahoo! is increasingly looking like it has long-term appeal again, which is why the shares have been heading higher. It's a good option for aggressive investors looking for a turnaround play. That said, the company's top line has yet to turn higher, though it has appeared to stabilize to some degree. Caution is still warranted. The addition of Tumblr, which notably increases the company's ad network, should be a big help. While investors might cheer a Hulu purchase, it has too much baggage for an easy integration.</Msg><Username>sublimalt</Username><Timestamp>1371136125102</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 11:08:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371136652241-25</Id><Title>Lawsuit Being Prepared Against YHOO</Title><Msg>A lawsuit is being filed against YHOO for failure to enforce its TOS agreements against posters who use these boards to express homophobic comments.

Just as a pervert luring a young kid cannot be arrested until he or she gets caught in the act of physically going to meet the child. Now if these posters went and met their victims face to face and said the same thing they could be in some trouble. But by arresting posters on chat boards would be really frivolous and would not contribute to a better society. A lot of . these so called abusive posts are just stupid kids or adults that are acting tough because they feel anonymous. But I doubt they belong in jail. We have enough frivolous lawsuits as it is putting people in jail. we don't need more big brother infringing on peoples lives. Enough with the big brother attitude.

Frankly, I don't like Yahoo! depending on Alibaba or Softbank to make a CR split happen. It reminds me of all of the double dealings last winter. Although, to be fair, that was before the Mayer/Loeb/Goldman trifecta. Much respect for both Ma &amp; Son - but Yahoo's continued hope for the tax savings puts them at a disadvantage when negotiating with Ma/Son.</Msg><Username>basketaetc1</Username><Timestamp>1371173153969</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 21:25:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371174944388-80</Id><Topic><Title>Get ready - Alibaba IPO announcement anyday!!</Title><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1371156079298</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 16:41:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ISS has reversed themselves and now support Dish in their bid to buy Clearwire.

MSFT lost over $2B on their online service division last year and this division on RED over 10 years now. In their annual report, MSFT BOD wanted Ballmer to do something about their online division, one of the options is to sell it. Then here is MM wants her search business back from MSFT. Now AAPL chooses Bing as their search default for their new smartphone coming to market soon. Recently AAPL put YHOO weather apps then now to include in their IOS. You tie these happening events, cash rich split deal is very possible to happen with MSFT will be one of the players.
