You could click on a topic thead on the old board, and up would pop all the messages under that thread. You could read some, aand ignore others. I also like the red star rating system, although of course it was abused by spammers. It was also possible to add non spam links to back up your message argument. You could also easily track the message history of a poster, from most recent going back. If you found someone with something halfway intelligent to say, you could go back and read all his messages on all the boards. can't do that anymore, evidently.

Another is that we cannot see the ID of the latest reply or jump directly to that reply. The most controversial is that URL (links) are not allowed anymore.

On ESPN site, users can hit the pause button to "freeze" the message updates, it is pretty neat.</Msg><Username>tiyang2</Username><Timestamp>1346900103030</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 22:55:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346900254974-72</Id><Topic><Title>Total Message postings seem to have sharply declined with the new format</Title><Username>market_logic2010</Username><Timestamp>1346894451954</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 21:20:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Yahoo is based on eyes on and clicks, they have made a very bad move!!
