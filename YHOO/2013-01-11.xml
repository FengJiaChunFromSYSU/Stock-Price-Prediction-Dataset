Search revenue</Title><Msg>Kara wrote: "Yahoo search visitors were -33%, -28%, and -24% in October, November and December respectively on a year-over-year basis." Kara questions: "So, it will be interesting to see if the company does so when it reports fourth-quarter earnings on January 28 and also if it says anything about continued traffic declines of its traditional Web business in the period and the impact on revenue." Here is the answer(from Eric Jackson/Yahoo analyst Justin Post of Bank of America Merrill Lynch ): "Even according to Post’s data, Yahoo search visitors were -33%, -28%, and -24% in October, November and December respectively on a year-over-year basis. Yet, Yahoo search revenue in Q3 was up 39% year-over-year to $472 million. For Q2, search revenue was up 38% year-over-year to $461 million. And in Q1, search revenue was up 38% year-over-year to $470 million."</Msg><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1357886164037</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 01:36:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357891193858-3</Id><Title>AllthingsD frontal attack</Title><Msg>....every day something new....why??</Msg><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1357891193858</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 02:59:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357891532649-4</Id><Title>Y! / FB page views</Title><Msg>Q4 y/y: Page views for the same months, all of Yahoo sites were -16%, -23%, and -13% respectively (y/y).

But that is where conference organizer and AllThingsD blogger Kara Swisher has buried the news that she married her longtime partner, Google vice president Megan Smith, last night, before the passage of Proposition 8, California's gay marriage ban, made same-sex marriages illegal once more. (The couple had had previous ceremonies — including, while we're disclosing things, one that I attended — but this was the first one that was a legal marriage under California law.) This would be no one's business but their own, except for the fact that Swisher actively covers Google and its rivals. Despite the marriage, Swisher's disclosure statement still claims that Smith's wealth in Google shares is not Swishers' as well: A substantial amount of her income from Google is in shares and options , some of which she has sold and some of which she still holds. Megan makes all her own decisions related to these shares and options, and I do not own or control any of them. Swisher explains to me that Smith's Google shares are going solely to their kids through living trusts, an arrangement which predates their marriage. But really, does it matter? I've always felt that Swisher's claim that she doesn't own or control Megan's shares was a bit of a fudge on the real situation; Swisher and Smith share a house and raise children together, and their lives and fortunes are thereby entwined. And their relationship, whatever its legal status, will continue to raise eyebrows as long as Swisher covers the industry. Marriage won't change that. Nor, as much as Google executives, Smith included, might wish otherwise, will it soften Swisher's savage coverage of the company.</Msg><Username>upyou_s</Username><Timestamp>1357923250093</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:54:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357923378686-54</Id><Topic><Title>The truth about Kara Swisher</Title><Username>upyou_s</Username><Timestamp>1357923250093</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 11:54:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Swisher benefits from her lesbian lover's fortune.

The latest change announced this week by Yahoo is a modification of its search engine functions that will now allow users to easily search for Flickr images tagged with the Creative Commons license. Now when users enter a search term into Yahoo's main image search engine they have the option of selecting a "Labeled for Reuse" filter that will only show images Flickr users have indicated are available under various types of Creative Commons attribution licenses. For years the Creative Commons attribution license option has allowed visitors to reuse Flickr images by simply giving credit to the photographer, a valuable feature that has helped to grow the popularity of Flickr as other photo sites have fallen by the wayside. Another component of the new Yahoo search feature is the ability to discover the names of the photographers within Yahoo 's search results field by simply clicking a tiny "i" icon shown on the corner of all of "Labeled for Reuse" images. The reusable images also include a link back to the photographer's original Flickr photo stream, as well as a link to a detailed explanation of exactly what kind of Creative Commons license under which the image is offered. The new Yahoo images search feature is also optimized for tablets and mobile devices. By integrating this simple function into its search system Yahoo not only seamlessly merges one of it most popular products into it main landing page, but also gives those who may have stopped using Yahoo as a search tool another reason to give the company's once popular search engine another try. According to a comScore report released in December, Google currently has 67 percent of the U.S. search market, with Microsoft sites holding steady at 16.2 percent, followed by Yahoo at just 12.1 percent.</Msg><Username>upyou_s</Username><Timestamp>1357927083012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:58:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357927135285-65</Id><Title>Bull flag....</Title><Msg>P&amp;F.

Every year it seems to be one thing...Widgets, then their magazine app Livestand, then Flickr and now its back to Widgets with Samsung again. None have taken the world by storm. As for Kara, she's never hidden the fact of her relationship, never abused her inside connections and has taken a higher ethical road then most.

Google has been at all-time highs for sometime and doing quite well so to risk your very career over a few percentage points seems dumb to me...Kara doesn't seem dumb.

Flickr: Flickr's popularity was never as pervasive as YHOO. I.E. if you turn away only a small population, there's plenty more user to replace them. Apple: Apple's product NEVER penetrated the consumer retail. Apple sold more than 85% of its product (prior to the introduction of first generation iPods and the return of Steve Jobs) to institutions (schools, government offices, etc). When they failed the first time, they turned away mainly SCHOOLS. They never turned away any retail customers. Moreover, most schools still aren't allowed to purchase anything but Apple products for their protection against viruses. In full discloser, I profited generously in the rise of APPL for the reason I just outlined. Albeit, I sold a bit early ($620s). Viewership at YHOO is declining and revenues have been relatively flat the last two years. Selling assets will only last so long. Moreover, if I read their balance sheet correctly they don't have another Alibaba to sell.</Msg><Username>tchen389</Username><Timestamp>1357938415517</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 16:06:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357938495165-106</Id><Title>AFTER HOUR</Title><Msg>YHOO = $19.32 *Data as of 01/11/2013 16:04</Msg><Username>upyou_s</Username><Timestamp>1357938495165</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 16:08:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357938827664-107</Id><Topic><Title>Major Correction Coming</Title><Username>tchen389</Username><Timestamp>1357936469404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:34:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I smell and drink espresso every morning and that's allot stronger than smelling your coffee!

As of 2012[update] she is the president and CEO of Yahoo!. Previously, she was a long-time executive and key spokesperson for Google.[8][9][10] She is the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company,[11] and has been ranked number 14 on the list of America's most powerful businesswomen of 2012 by Fortune magazine.[12] Contents [hide] 1 Early life and education 2 Career 3 Boards and honors 4 Personal life 5 References 6 External links [edit] Early life and educationMayer was born in Wausau, Wisconsin, the daughter of Margaret Mayer, an art teacher of Finnish descent,[13] and Michael Mayer, an engineer.[14][15] After graduating from Wausau West High School in 1993,[16] Mayer was selected by Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson as one of the state's two delegates to attend the National Youth Science Camp in West Virginia.[17] Mayer graduated with honors from Stanford University with a B.S. in symbolic systems and an M.S. in computer science. For both degrees, she specialized in artificial intelligence. In 2009, the Illinois Institute of Technology granted Mayer an honoris causa doctorate degree in recognition of her work in the field of search.[18] [edit] CareerMayer joined Google in 1999 as employee number 20 and was the company's first female engineer.[19][20] During her 13 years with the company, she was an engineer, designer, product manager and executive. Mayer held key roles in Google Search, Google Images, Google News, Google Maps, Google Books, Google Product Search, Google Toolbar, iGoogle and Gmail. She also oversaw the layout of Google's famous, unadorned search homepage.[21][22] In her final years with Google, she was Vice President of Local, Maps, and Location Services and, before that, Vice President of Search Products and User Experience.[23] The video of Mayer's 2011 interview of Lady Gaga as part of the Musicians@Google series has received over two million views on YouTube.[24] Prior to joining Google, Mayer worked at the UBS research lab (Ubilab) in Zurich, Switzerland, and SRI International in Menlo Park, California.[25] On July 16, 2012, Mayer was appointed President and CEO of Yahoo!, effective the following day. She is also a member of the company's board of directors.[26][27] 1 [edit] Boards and honorsAs well as sitting on the board of directors of Walmart and Yahoo! Mayer also sits on several non-profit boards such as Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, New York City Ballet, San Francisco Ballet and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.[28][29][30] Mayer actively invests in technology companies, including crowd-sourced design retailer Minted,[31] live video platform Airtime, and mobile payments processor Square. Mayer was named to Fortune magazine's annual list of America's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011.[32] She was ranked 50, 44, 42 and 38, respectively.

Go check my other posts. As for the share price I'll take $17.58. Not because I dislike YAHOO, but becasue the overall market is going to decline from here and take Yahoo with it. It was a nice run from September until the recent high....but a correction is underway, shake the weak apples off the tree so to speak. Plus everything people post on this board as the reason for a higher share price is nothing not known to the market. Markets don't always go stright up...there are corrections along the way. So we are having a correction. Nothing more nothing less. We know they have a new CEO, we know they have a bunch of cash, we know they have a share buy back, we know they own a piece of Alibaba, we know GS raised their target, we know about other upgrades. All of this stuff is out there. People repeating it over and over again has no effect. Just looking at the price action in a logical way. Streaks higher on promising news over the last few months and then begins a correction. The big questions are where does it hold on the downside, what price above would look good to tell you the uptrend is back on, and what price on the downside breaks the rally. These are the questions I look at and look to answer. Got to have a plan....or the market will make a plan for you!
