You just kissed his #$%$ calling him a smart man, both have hardly any posts and you didn't post for 2 YEARS until suddenly a few months ago. Who goes hiding for YEARS and suddenly can't stop talking eh Braindead_Dave? In fact, you're also that styo3000 ID as well. That ID posts in the same topics as Eric_Steiman across different stocks going back years. Like you Braindead_Dave, Eric went into hiding as he went a year and half without posting(May 19th 2011 in a Styo3000 topic to Sep. 20th 2012). Then he posted in November in whose SODA topic...you guessed it Styo3000. I get it, you suddenly find a stock you like so bring your ID's over but don't lie to me about it. You're right about one thing as this Minnesota morning sky is gorgeous, best time of the year.</Msg><Username>hotmodeltestid122</Username><Timestamp>1364994052603</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 09:00:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364995131711-7</Id><Topic><Title>So!!!!

Currently i have no position at all. I have been watching it very closely. Everything you say does not rationalize a 50% increase since November. I will remind you when hedge fund managers and other institutional investors start selling in 2 weeks.

Thanks Marissa" So a target that you come up with makes you happy? And you thank the CEO $5 below that price? Kind of strange behavior don't you think. Well, my target is $18 by the 4th of July as the world markets decline...the start of which began today. So you know what you do at $28.....what do you do if things don't work out as planned and we see $18? Is she then dirt? Is it all her fault? No Bing news like everyone predicted...No Facebook Deal like everyone held their breath for.......and something to consider-what happens to the value of those Asian assets everyone is betting on if in fact the world markets decline significantly from here? And Yahoo will have a bit of dirt on their face for buying all this stock at such lofty levels. Bad use of capital if you ask me. I'm not out to bash the stock but rather to look objectively after a 50%+ move.</Msg><Username>wbobeli</Username><Timestamp>1365025567575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 17:46:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365026062198-52</Id><Topic><Title>LOAD YOUR WAGON EXCELLENT ENTRY AT 23+ SOON 28+</Title><Username>tobyt001</Username><Timestamp>1365013721463</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 14:28:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good luck with that...your a joke,.</Msg><Username>eric_steiman</Username><Timestamp>1365026062198</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 17:54:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365026877216-53</Id><Topic><Title>Better than Yelp, Angi, Zillow, Open Table or MeetMe - All Yahoo should not buy</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1363503949543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 03:05:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Benefits of Local Corp's Local Solutions: We believe that our local search results delivered to our flagshipsite and our Network partners, provide the following benefits to consumers using our services, our Network partners, and advertisers (whether from our own efforts, our channel partners, or our third-party ad suppliers):</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1365026877216</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:07:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365026961332-54</Id><Topic><Title>Better than Yelp, Angi, Zillow, Open Table or MeetMe - All Yahoo should not buy</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1363503949543</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 03:05:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>• Access to a Large Number of Local Business Listings and Local Content .

We believe that search-based advertising delivers a more relevant list of businesses, products and services for our users because advertisers generally only pay for keywords, categories and regions that are related to the products and services they offer. By providing access to our users via performance, display and subscription ad units, businesses can target consumers at the exact time a consumer has demonstrated an interest in what that business has to offer. As a result of our core demographic, we believe that local and commercial searches performed on our flagship-site tend to convert into buying customers at a higher rate than many other types of search traffic. As a consequence, there is competition from third-parties to place their advertiser listings on our website, which along with our direct advertisers and growing local display advertising offerings drives monetization of our traffic. We believe that our users’ propensity to buy correlates with the value of our traffic, and explains, in part, why our flagship-site monetizes its search traffic at higher levels than other types of search traffic.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1365028881741</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:41:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365031271034-61</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo Closes at $23.78 New Four Year High!</Title><Username>tetheredbird</Username><Timestamp>1364932831187</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 16:00:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$26 is a popular PT.</Msg><Username>turmaniloil</Username><Timestamp>1365031271034</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 19:21:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365031399095-62</Id><Topic><Title>Time for hotmodel and dr.gloom to congratulate coldone</Title><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1364221083079</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 10:18:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You look stupid.</Msg><Username>turmaniloil</Username><Timestamp>1365031399095</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 19:23:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365033253126-63</Id><Topic><Title>YAHOO closes above $24 today!</Title><Username>randywms55</Username><Timestamp>1364986668384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 06:57:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lol, nice save.

Probably couldn't negotiate until after the deal was nixed on 3/31/2013" First, you know the problem when you assume something? Second the deal wasn't nixed. They have a right to terminate the deal on or after 3/31/2013. Third, who in their right mind would enter into an agreement where you couldn't talk to another party until the deal was, in your words "nixed"? And even if they were stupid enough to do that, they still couldn't be talking to any 2nd or 3rd party as the deal still hasn't been "nixed". Would you enter into an agreement with anyone which prevented you from talking to someone else? Why would you give someone that right? Ever? Yahoo is staying with Bing for now. Nothing has changed. Otherwise, Monday morning they would have announced they were terminating their deal with Microsoft and announced a new alliance. The date has come and gone. Believe what you want...but if they were going to make a change they would have done it.</Msg><Username>wbobeli</Username><Timestamp>1365038160425</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 21:16:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365042368961-68</Id><Topic><Title>Pivotal Research Raises Yahoo PT to $26 from $23!</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1364831642159</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 11:54:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some say $27.</Msg><Username>tr420</Username><Timestamp>1365042368961</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 22:26:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365042432719-69</Id><Topic><Title>Barclay's, Needham, B.
