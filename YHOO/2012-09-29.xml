Agreed: Marissa indeed must acquaint herself with the stakeholders as you point out. This is complex and very long-term process. However, she seems to have made some ironclad philosophies for moving the company in a profitable direction employing quick, short-cut solutions. In view of Yahoo's need to get things turned around in quick order, she might approach Microsoft or Google, and not take so much to demand so much from her employees the ways in which she is doing. I am not comfortable at all with her approach and from what the message boards here seem to say, others are not showing much confidence accordingly with her CEO performance so far. I suggest for now we must all wait and see, and this includes being on the look out for what strategies she adopts over the next few months that may or may not include making contact with MSFT or GOOG.</Msg><Username>baxtergerald374</Username><Timestamp>1348891618131</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 00:06:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348893480695-2</Id><Topic><Title>YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO STRONG BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>jimtalkner</Username><Timestamp>1348883837071</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 21:57:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And I sense that you are going on IGNORE..

May i ask why you bothered? If you invest with the same degree of skill that you post you must be very very deep in debt. Do a little research next time. Please!" The above message from mb525789 doesn't make sense! First of all, how is my post "very fine" even though this respondent states they wonder why I even bothered to write it. What does that all mean? Second, how does this writer conclude my remarks indicate I am in deep debt?? That is puzzling to say the least!! I don't profess to be a skillful investor, but at least I am attentive to the general jist regarding Yahoo. Now it really is in debt, so I understand. I can't do much research on the future of the company since I don't know where Marissa will take the company. If you can tell me where my research is lacking, I gladly accept your suggestions. I do research all the time for the most part on stocks. If mb525789 were to make an analysts report for Schwab with confusing and misleading comments like these, I doubt the price of Yahoo could be helped much, to say the least.</Msg><Username>baxtergerald374</Username><Timestamp>1348896830737</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 01:33:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348902757166-4</Id><Topic><Title>Poll: Will Yahoo rise 12% in 41 Days?</Title><Username>trudeau256</Username><Timestamp>1348874614215</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 19:23:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Election day is November 6, 2012, always the 1st Tuesday in November...

I just wanted you to be sure you expanded your analysis to include all classes of stake holders. I am sort of counting on Loeb to be somewhat of a mentor here to help on the business side of YHOO. Another thought I have is that YHOO and GOOGLE will not connect to do any serious business together...Antitrust! I do see MSFT selling their online services to YHOO, Bing, MSN, and the 18% of MSNBC. MSFT is losing a ton annually and such a sell would be the easy way out, maybe take as part of the payment some investment in YHOO shares. YHOO has great potential over time and since they have missed social, they can maybe catch the lead in the next major direction in human mass communication. Mobile and MobileX . I would like to see YHOO buy Path. Before long we are going to be at the same place Dick Tracy was in 1950, just wear a device on our wrist and be connected world wide 24/7 and that will be our identity. Also watch SNDK, they have a lead on solid state storage, and storage of data using as little enegry as possible will be big.</Msg><Username>goldeagle14</Username><Timestamp>1348932329926</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 11:25:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348936866793-16</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa not popular with stock holder</Title><Username>tobyt001</Username><Timestamp>1348857008507</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:30:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I AM LONG BECAUSE I LIKE YAHOO" Yahoo is a lot closer to bankruptcy than you think.</Msg><Username>peterhuffings</Username><Timestamp>1348936866793</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 12:41:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348937012948-17</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa not popular with stock holder</Title><Username>tobyt001</Username><Timestamp>1348857008507</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 14:30:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The only hope for this firm is to be sold."

Re your post. Re: Now that was a very fine post you just made. "Your lead remark; Marissa not popular with stock holder. How so? Because she has not diclosed he plans? Well, a CEO of a publically traded entity such as Yahoo! Inc. is bound by SEC rules, and sensitive time periods of the reporting quarter as to what they can disclose and what they cannot disclose. No one has a clue if they like or dislike until several quarters are reported. And what the CEO discloses at the appropriate time." In your referrence to the $100,000,000. project sales revenue requirement. "Projects undertaken in a enviroment such as Yahoo! Inc. projects are that are generated by employees at Yahoo! Inc. must generate such numbers to be viable. Otherwise you end up with a scenario during the Bartz era. If you would recall the product development head, Blake Irving spent some time and resources to develop what was basically an app to enable the user to edit and publish a magazine with their pad in a garage. But the fact was there were 10,000 others [developers] working in their garage developing a similar app. Truly a project that had no place at Yahoo! Inc. Cost to develop and maintain would have never produced a ROI." Re: Is that how business was done at Google?? I expect not. "I would recommend you research that." Re: What this is saying is Marissa does not have any concretely designed business plan to bring to the CEO's post so her days as head of Yahoo are numbered. Expect her time will probably end up being a "conduit" through which Yahoo will somehow ally its search engine with Google or Microsoft. "On this planet we are well aware of a Yahoo / Microsoft alliance/deal. Is this not know where you are from?" Re: I still think that Yahoo was foolish not to go in with Microsoft last year. "?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????" Re: Boy if Marissa has any brains in that beautiful blond head of hers she will see Google buys Yahoo out and she can probably retire for life with a big golden chute retirement package. "So you are stating that Google can buy out Yahoo! Inc.? WOW! That would be something to behold. Not a lawyer on this planet that would advocate that even be attempted. Can you guess why?" Re: Right now Yahoo is really not got much of a future; it's demise is written on the walls. Marissa can't save a sinking ship called Yahoo. "Yahoo! Inc. is a profitable entity, has been a profitable entity and will remain a profitable entity. Yahoo! Inc. is not a sinking ship, true, in the past there were rudder problems." Re: Hell, they have fired 3 CEO's in less than 6 months. "Really, Batrz was terminated and Thompson was terminated. Interim CEO's Morse and Levinsohn were not terminated." Re: I hope all involved will start to show some intellectual honesty in their assessment of what it will take to salvage of what is left of Yahoo. "What it takes to salvage Yahoo! Inc. will have to come from Yahoo! Inc. because you don't have a clue." Re: In this matter, Marissa might consult with John Chambers at Cisco whose company has recently started to make a comeback, but whose CEO has been around since that company was started well over 20 years ago. "OMG! Really, Apples and Oranges." Re: That is something I would say is of financially redeeming value that Yahoo must attempt to cultivate in making itself both a profitable enterprise and an attractive investment opportunity. "That is why they have restructed the Board of Directors. Mr. Loeb and crew is there to insure that the financial engineering plans implement. That is why the new CEO is there." "Yahoo! Inc. Asia investments are now in the process of being monitized. That past investment of $1B USD is yielding what? Do you even know?" "Yes indeed yours was a very fine post, one which clearly defines your lack of basic knowledge of Yahoo! Inc. Actually i am astounded that you could even find your way to this message board.
