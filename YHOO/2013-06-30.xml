Programmatic platforms and DIY advertising tools promise the opportunity to reach a target audience at scale, using technology that eliminates the untold hours advertisers would otherwise have to spend contacting sales teams from publisher sites around the country or the world. But not all of these large-scale programmatic offerings solve the problems advertisers have in reaching their target audiences in local markets. Facebook and many other platforms use geo-targeting and publicly available user data to serve ads to the intended audience, but they don’t offer the opportunity to specifically target the kinds of publisher sites and vertical category pages where those ads will appear. If consumers aren’t seeing your ads — if they’re not positioned above the fold or adjacent to relevant content — the money you’ve spent for that inventory is wasted. From a branding perspective, it’s valuable for your ads to appear alongside content in trusted media sources, and on sites that cater to markets and verticals valuable to the advertiser. Advertisers and brands are increasingly acknowledging the merits of advertising on the local level, with local online advertising predicted to rise from $23.7 billion to $25.7 billion by the end of 2013.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1372597626461</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 09:07:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372600018033-4</Id><Topic><Title>Facebook and many other platforms don’t offer the opportunity to specifically target like offers of Local Corp with premium content</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1372597626461</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 09:07:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Premium networks like Local Corp can guarantee placement adjacent to the content users most desire Premium content adjacency: Above-the-fold inventory adjacent to premium content — the content most relevant to and valued by users — will always be premium inventory. It’s increasingly important to make sure your ads appear alongside premium content, and simple branding backs that up, with more than 60 percent of agencies and marketers saying premium content assists branding objectives. When consumers notice your ads near the targeted content they value, they’re more inclined to feel an affinity to your brand, which has a halo effect that spreads wherever else they go. Premium networks can guarantee placement adjacent to the content users most desire.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1372600018033</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 09:46:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372604331378-5</Id><Topic><Title>Like it or Not Alibaba IPO this year</Title><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1372480450123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 00:34:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think Jack Ma message start your countdown we are coming</Msg><Username>goingbravo</Username><Timestamp>1372604331378</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 10:58:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372604469469-6</Id><Topic><Title>The manipulation will continue until the JEWISH pigs are are gutted like sea bass.</Title><Username>mlkeyylucky7</Username><Timestamp>1372567942152</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 00:52:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You work really hard at being repugnant.

Holdings of US Treasuries held at the Fed on behalf of official foreign institutions dropped a record $32.4bn to $2.93tn, eclipsing the prior mark of $24bn in August 2007. It was the third week of outflows in the past four. Private investors are also dumping fixed income. Bond funds tracked by EPFR Global, a data provider, saw total redemptions of $23.3bn in the week to June 26. US funds were the worst hit, with withdrawals totalling $10.6bn, but emerging market debt funds also saw record redemptions of $5.6bn. Over the past five weeks emerging market debt and equity fund outflows have totalled $35bn, of which $22.5bn has fled stock market funds. “People are throwing in the towel,” said Markus Rosgen, chief Asia equity strategist at Citigroup. “It’ll drag the market down lower over the course of the summer.” Fixed income markets have tumbled since Fed chairman Ben Bernanke first signalled on May 22 that the US central bank would begin reducing its asset purchases later this year. Yields on 10-year US Treasuries have risen sharply since then, hitting 2.52 per cent on Friday compared with 1.62 per cent at the start of May.</Msg><Username>garybirch55</Username><Timestamp>1372626036095</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 17:00:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372626701289-28</Id><Topic><Title>$ _ WITHIN 3 TO 5 YEARS, YHOO STOCK WIL BE WORTH $250 PER SHARE _ $</Title><Username>rock_hard_80</Username><Timestamp>1372518189865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 11:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no, he knows about yahoo the filth bags, and soon others will too!</Msg><Username>aroadrock</Username><Timestamp>1372626701289</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 17:11:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372626882441-29</Id><Topic><Title>Facebook and many other platforms don’t offer the opportunity to specifically target like offers of Local Corp with premium content</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1372597626461</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 09:07:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sorry, you're fightin' a losing battle, especially now that you've given the compettition a heads-up...just sell all your yahoo and buy some hooya</Msg><Username>aroadrock</Username><Timestamp>1372626882441</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 17:14:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372627061517-30</Id><Topic><Title>Ms Mayer, you didn't anwer all the questions about Wal*Mart....</Title><Username>madmilker70</Username><Timestamp>1372616212103</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 14:16:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>she's not interested in it...sad, sad, sad...she's probably reading all of the disgusting postings made on yahoo messageboards and likin' 'em a lot...if she removed them, she wouldn't have any good reading material...</Msg><Username>aroadrock</Username><Timestamp>1372627061517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 17:17:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372627408934-31</Id><Topic><Title>Former Alibaba Exec (David Wei) Puts Alibaba Group IPO Value at $100 Billion</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372431133661</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:52:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>toad</Msg><Username>sublimalt</Username><Timestamp>1372627408934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 17:23:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372627594297-32</Id><Topic><Title>Former Alibaba Exec (David Wei) Puts Alibaba Group IPO Value at $100 Billion</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372431133661</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:52:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i have been in marketing for a good time, and familiar with the type of marketing being used in alibaba, and will tell you....IT WILL SOON FAIL....sorry...oh yeh....mark this post</Msg><Username>aroadrock</Username><Timestamp>1372627594297</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 17:26:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372627656222-33</Id><Topic><Title>Former Alibaba Exec (David Wei) Puts Alibaba Group IPO Value at $100 Billion</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1372431133661</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:52:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you know, it just might be a blazig post with enough ignorant investors (which there are) but 's going to a fizzling IPO soon enough</Msg><Username>aroadrock</Username><Timestamp>1372627656222</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 17:27:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372630208549-34</Id><Title>Why I just Bought 200.00 Worth Of Paula Deen's Cookware</Title><Msg>And I do not cook.
