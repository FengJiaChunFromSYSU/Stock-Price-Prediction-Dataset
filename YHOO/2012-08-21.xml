They pretty much rehired Bartz but add to that java programming skills.. woopie doo... I mean, this has to be a joke of a hiring. Now you have news of execs leaving yahoo left and right.. internally, no one respects Marissa because they all know she is going on vacation pretty soon. And Marissa is also a fool for taking up this no-win job. You have millions already, why take up a job that calls for you to work 100 hrs a week when you have a baby due? look out for your family first, take your multi-million from google accumulated and be with your kid full time. Why take up a job that you know you can't commit too without sacrificing family.... that is why the market have no confidence with Marissa now, they know she can't put in the hours and be with her baby soon. Yahoo BOD and Loeb made a big mistake. Now they need a co-CEO, framed as COO to do the real job.</Msg><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1345552151380</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 08:29:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345553957437-5</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo in the midst of selling its stake in Yahoo!

If the market cap is over $7 bil why can't they sell it for close to that? My understanding is Y-Jap is doing pretty well so if Softbank won't pay a fair price why can't they sell sell it for $7 bil to some other entity or on the market (to funds, perhaps a bit at a time on open market, to PE etc.) and pay the taxes and still end up with $5 bil or so cash (they won't have to pay 35% one entire $7 bil as they put some investment into Y-Jap)? Or in cash/rich split take any reasonable asset (approx $2.5 bil) that can be sold later, and $4.5 bil in cash.

Given she worked there just a month ago and that both companies compete directly isn't this consider wrong? All Google employees coming knows exactly what Google did, is doing or will be doing going forward. I can understand if MM attracts talent from other places due to her contacts but inviting Google folks sounds too unethical and unprofessional to me. Also she is totally inexperienced to be CEO as she has never ever been one in her life. If Carl Icahn and others can't make this stock rise in last 5 yrs despite several seasoned CEO's like Carol Bartz, Terry Semel, etc I don't know how much Marissa Mayer would be able to do given her lack of finance &amp; business operations knowledge imho.

It seems that under MM YHOOO is back to keeping shareholders in the dark and taking forever to get anything done. And the stock has dropped in a strong market! Look at how much Levinsohn got done (AG deal, FB settlement-though honestly not sure that was so good unless YHOO is just sold soon) in his short tenure. YHOO just needs to be sold and Levinsohn would have been best to get that done. I see no evidence that MM is anything but a gamble and time killer.

It may not have dropped today but it sure is not up. IMO it is way under priced because they have not yet monetized the Asian assets, folks are reacting to not getting a quick fix of cash, and few folks really care about the company. It would appear to me that the market is at best indifferent to Yahoo! if not outright hostile. Some have good reason to be upset and tired of waiting but it appears as if most have simply given up and want to see a liquidation sale. Personally, I would like to see some real action - either sell the company or have it do something constructive and grow at a rapid pace.....right now it seems to be doing nothing........and the share price is going nowhere....and so it will be until Yahoo is decisive one way or the other [I don't care which]</Msg><Username>firsttestcase</Username><Timestamp>1345585088716</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 17:38:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345585673807-61</Id><Topic><Title>mm's keeping price up to let big boys out</Title><Username>madcow_muffin</Username><Timestamp>1345584173565</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 17:22:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with you about the price. However I think there is very little that mm can do with Yahoo as it is today. I read that still another of their top sales people is leaving. I'm guessing that anybody reasonably creative with a good resume already has it on the street. The new board members, even with their great CV's, haven't a clue because they have no communication within the company. The corporate culture is lying up the food chain and CYA. Previously issued stock options have little, if any value. Yahoo is just too far gone; they don't have anything like the depth of talent that they need to turn it around; they can't hire that talent. I personally believe that the company needs to be broken up and sold.

Also the value of all AG was put at $32 bil (per Silverlake DST buy) and yet all YHOO got in recent $7.1 bil deal was at the equiv. price of $35 for all AG., (with some upside if it goes for more than $35 bil) It must actually be worth much more than that now.

LIVE WITH IT-she is pregnant &amp; will continue to be the ceo (like it or not). we can have fun with it but telling her she has two choices (get rid of the baby or resign) is totally STUPID ! what if YOUR WIFE was pregnant &amp; they told her if she didn't have the abortion they wouldn't promote her? i hope the one that wrote the message is up for a raise (or promotion) &amp; his employer notifies him to remove his thing or take a hike! don't blame her for taking the job since it was a brilliant move on her part! (she got the job &amp; loads of money plus benefits &amp; being pregnant at the same time) lets realize where the blame is &amp; that's yahoos board /especially mr. loeb that was always worshipped on this messenger board! remember he got his friends put on the board to make the right decisions.</Msg><Username>matsky5</Username><Timestamp>1345604258624</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:57:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345604258626-73</Id><Topic><Title>Marissa to remove YHOO stock price from Yahoo Finance</Title><Username>longshank028</Username><Timestamp>1345573667954</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 14:27:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a freaking joke this woman is.

I say buy low and sell high. Or is it buy high, sell low? It's confusing at times, but I'm always right. Follow me, and never lose money except for when you do. I have many sources, reliable voices in my head, that tell me when is a good time to buy. Chances are, if you buy when I tell you to, and you hold it long enough and sell at the right time, you may make a profit or not. Either way, I am Coldone and rule all!</Msg><Username>coldonerulesall</Username><Timestamp>1345607116969</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:45:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
