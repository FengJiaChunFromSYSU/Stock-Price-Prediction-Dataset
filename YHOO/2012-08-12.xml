Often companies have some kind of tax liability that yet to be paid. But I am just very concerned about the magnitude of this tax liability, which is almost a billion dollars. How did this number come from? I really don't have a clue, as all these Asian assets are still in the book, and they are yet to be realized. There is no tax due whatsoever if you never realized any gain from any assets unless and until those assets are sold. $895,941.000 is a huge sum of money.</Msg><Username>going_lower_because</Username><Timestamp>1344750648618</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 01:50:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344772519348-3</Id><Topic><Title>There is a Rumor that Yahoo...</Title><Username>coelho32</Username><Timestamp>1344649761503</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 21:49:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, because it's not like RIM has any mobile patents or anything. lol. RIM wouldn't sell for $6B. Try $10B. Prem Watsa's ACB is around $17. He isn't selling w/o making a profit. Other insiders won't sell cheap either. Where people get these rumours from is just laughable. RIM will not be sold anytime soon unless someone is crazy enough to pay $10B or more.</Msg><Username>slickvguy</Username><Timestamp>1344772519348</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 07:55:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344772840838-4</Id><Topic><Title>i cant take the yhoo main page anymore!!</Title><Username>onespyldpinkushn</Username><Timestamp>1344643311718</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 20:01:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree 100%. I've just about had it with Yahoo. I have stopped using Yahoo finance except for these annoying bulletin boards. The biggest problem I have with Yahoo is that so many features on their sites simply do not work. Is it because I'm using firefox? I don't know. SO many bugs that just shouldn't be there. Doesn't anyone test the webpages to see if they work? You add a symbol on the finance page, which is supposed to add it to your portfolio, and it adds it TWICE! lol. The options quotes are a complete mess. You try to post comments on stories, and more often than not, they don't get posted unless you do it 5 times. Just a bunch of annoying things like that everywhere you go. Stuff that doesn't work properly or at all. But above all else, I agree with you, the homepage is worse than National Enquirer. Why does Yahoo want tabloid like garbage on the homepage? Their top stories are pathetic. So unimportant. And also the stories lean very much to the left, which annoys me (but not the so-called liberals, I suppose).</Msg><Username>slickvguy</Username><Timestamp>1344772840838</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 08:00:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344775560109-5</Id><Title>Yahoo has deceived its stockholders again</Title><Msg>And again !!
