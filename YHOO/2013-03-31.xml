IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Local Corporation (LOCM), a leading online local media company, today announced the launch of “Fusion by Local,” a new premium ad network for advertisers and brand marketers seeking to engage with targeted local audiences in markets across the U.S. Fusion by Local gives advertisers the ability to reach targeted customers in local markets through premium display advertising inventory across some of the top media properties in the country, including sites in the company’s established network of over 1,000 regional media sites. The premium network also provides regional media publishers with access to national advertisers and brands to drive incremental advertising revenue through their media properties. With local display advertising on the rise and expected to grow 18.2 percent this year to $3.4 billion1, advertisers are seeking ways to more effectively engage their target audiences quickly and efficiently on a local level. National and regional brands that are looking to advertise locally are increasingly seeking premium ad positioning for their campaigns near relevant content, with high quality publishers and media sites.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1364728638762</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 07:17:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364736000530-15</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo to Buy....</Title><Username>grey116677</Username><Timestamp>1364569862860</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 11:11:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hotmodel: Happy Easter!

Neither is a leader in mobile access or search but that can be addressed later. As redundant and useless employees (mostly at Yahoo, I'm guessing) are eliminated or replaced there will be significant cost savings. I can envision 1 share of Facebook stock for each share of Yahoo or perhaps even a market price exchange. All shareholders benefit.

However, Yahoo cannot surive much less prosper as a stand-alone company. There is more inertia than innovation and more incompetence than genius.

CCUR has gained 12 straight months and 8 of the past 9 trading days. Has the best looking chart with the most momentum, but not even close to a peak. Currently $7.91 and has had a lot of resistance at $8, but the resistance is 99% gone and as soon as CCUR breaks $8 strongly, it could rapidly breakout to the $12-$15 range. CCUR's EPS last quarter was double quarter before and quadruple two quarters ago. SEAC is currently $11.89 and expected to soon report full year non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 for a P/E of 30. CCUR's non-GAAP EPS last quarter of $0.125 equals $0.50 annualized and a P/E of 30 would value CCUR at $15 per share. Almost all of the $8 resistance is now gone and as soon as CCUR breaks out big above $8, it could absolutely explode to $15 without any major resistance in between! CCUR is the global video on demand (VOD) technology leader for the pay-TV industry. CCUR has total global reach of 54mm VOD homes and 23mm of them are in the U.S. CCUR's main U.S. VOD clients are Time Warner Cable, Cox, Charter, and Bright House. CCUR has 30% global VOD market share and a 65% market share for "start over" a new service that CCUR launched for Time Warner Cable and Bright House that their subscribers repeatedly rate their favorite pay-TV feature. CCUR recently won U.S. patent for their about to launch network DVR technology based over the cloud that will eliminate need for physical DVR devices!</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1364772963202</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 19:36:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364773285404-45</Id><Topic><Title>Time for hotmodel and dr.gloom to congratulate coldone</Title><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1364221083079</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-25 10:18:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes definitely let him ( cold one) know he is absolutely right about yahoo &amp; he doesn't have to tell us about all the other stocks he was wrong on!
