Goog paid Overture (Yahoo) $200 million in cash to avoid what VRNG will do which is a GAME CHANGER. Have your legal team review the court filing for the upcoming battle between Goog and VRNG and move quickly to take advantage of what is in front of you. The prior mgt team bought Overture and it paid off, but this is the REAL DEAL and you can start a whole new future for this sector. AOL is a blatant infringer of the 420 patent that VRNG holds and owns and was recognized by GOOG, IAC and AOL for starters. Andrew Lang was the innovator and you need to act now, go for VRNG at $12 and you will be the smartest woman heading ALL companies, garaunteed!! Small price to pay for immortaltiy!

Yahoo is close to selling out of Alibaba, and I would imagine that it will be selling Yahoo Japan as well fairly soon. The bottom line is at Yahoo’s current price, its business is being valued at $0. Follow the numbers, you will see. Yahoo owns 40% of Alibaba, and Alibaba said it would pay a minimum of $7.1 billion in cash and stock for up to half of Yahoo’s 40% stake. The Chinese company also will pay royalties to Yahoo for as long as four years. Of the remaining 20%, Alibaba would have the right to buy as much as half from Yahoo at the share price of a potential public offering of the Chinese Internet giant, or allow Yahoo to sell those shares in the IPO. Yahoo can choose to hold on to the last 10% of its stake or sell it to Alibaba at the market price of Alibaba after it becomes a publicly traded company. Yahoo expects to clear $4.2 billion after taxes on the first 20%, and I would imagine they will clear at least another $4.2 on the remaining 20%. Yahoo owns 35% of Yahoo Japan, which right now has a market cap of $21.5 billion. Yahoo’s stake is worth $7.5 billion. If you include all of the other tangible assets that Yahoo owns, and back out the goodwill and other intangibles, then Yahoo’s tangible asset value is $19.4 billion, most of which is cash.</Msg><Username>barloparlo</Username><Timestamp>1344014613178</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 13:23:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344015015339-16</Id><Topic><Title>Bartz will focus on shareholder value</Title><Username>coldonerules</Username><Timestamp>1277413681000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2010-06-24 17:08:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How did that go oh great mystic?</Msg><Username>dr.gloom</Username><Timestamp>1344015015339</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 13:30:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344017768192-17</Id><Title>Not much of an up move with the Dow up 235.</Title><Msg>Still well below where it was just before Scotty was hired.</Msg><Username>mewag51</Username><Timestamp>1344017768192</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 14:16:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344018403886-18</Id><Topic><Title>This piece of crap can't even get to $16-</Title><Username>specialforceshol</Username><Timestamp>1344010767876</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 12:19:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And was over $18 before going to $11.

Oh, I see, both are crummy. It takes Yahoo 2 weeks to repair(sorta) website IT glitches that other company IT guys fix in a day or less. But, that's what you get when your IT is staffed with for-profit "Tech Institute" grad-u-ates. Don't laugh, as that is all Yahoo can get to work there now and some of those even say when offered a job there......, :"ah, let me think about it". Mayer should have done that, but she sold out for the big bucks and won't make a speck of difference there. More giant $$$ down the rathole for nothing! Getting to be Yahoo's business....losing money......"and we are so good at it, we are experts!"
