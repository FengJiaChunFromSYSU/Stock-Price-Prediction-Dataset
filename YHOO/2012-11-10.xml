So, which company will be first to get back to the share price of $38? My bet is on Yahoo – literally. I am a Yahoo shareholder. On September 18th, Yahoo turned deferred cash into cash when it closed a deal with Alibaba, the Chinese Internet company. Yahoo had 40 percent stake in the company and Alibaba repurchased half of it back. In the deal, Yahoo received approximately $7.6 billion — $6.3 billion in cash and $800 million in preferred shares of Alibaba, as well as $550 million under a revised licensing agreement. In addition, Yahoo owns a 35 percent equity stake in Yahoo Japan (YAHOF.PK), a public company that was formed in 1996 by Yahoo and Softbank. As of October 23, 2012 Yahoo's stake in Yahoo Japan was valued at $7.5 billion (before taxes). It was reported in January 2012 that Yahoo wished to sell its stake. Altogether, Yahoo’s cash equivalent holdings total $13 billion with about 1.18 billion outstanding shares. Cash per share is $11. Doing the math, at a share price of $16.84 (as of market close 10/31/12), that’s how I arrived at 65.4 percent as the amount of its share price backed up by cash.</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1352567165714</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 12:06:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352570299547-9</Id><Topic><Title>Facebook Or Yahoo: Which One Gets Back To $38 First?</Title><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1352567165714</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 12:06:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agree, unless FB buys yhoo.

There seems to be an excellent chance that CEO Marissa Mayer, appointed in July, can satisfy investors by restoring at least a little hope that Yahoo! (ticker: YHOO) can be a real contender in the new world of the mobile Internet. The stock's valuation isn't overly demanding, and a bright team with fresh views on the matter may at least stem the tide of decline in recent years, which would be enough to encourage numerous investors. Beyond that, however, looms a much larger question. At Friday's close of $17.26, the stock is up 20% from its 52-week low. Yahoo! over the years has lost what little identity and urgency as a tech company it had at the outset, and it isn't clear Mayer, for all her skill and experience, can give it that. If she can't, then the stock's recent gains will be a short trip to nowhere. We old-timers can recall encountering Yahoo! in the early '90s. It was a simple site with a nicely organized collection of hyperlinks that people could check out as they got used to this thing called the World Wide Web, something like a table of contents. The mission was never auspicious. The founding credo, if we recall correctly, was "Yahoo: A more efficient way to waste your time." Founders Jerry Yang and David Filo won the venture-capital lottery and went public, along with a gaggle of Web hopefuls such as Infoseek and Excite and Lycos, who've all gone by the wayside. There followed a period of many years wandering through various transformations, during which Yahoo's revenue was growing by double-digits as users of the Web expanded at an astronomical rate. Yahoo! used its stock as currency to make a number of acquisitions, transforming itself into an odd amalgam of content and sociability without any particular identity as a technology company. Yahoo's founders retreated from the scene as a parade of professional managers came and went. Mayer, who sources tell me is greatly respected in Silicon Valley, has a sort of Obama moment, if you will—in the '08 sense, not the '12 sense. Having taken a rather bad hand, she enjoys tremendous good will in her effort to restore hope to Yahoo! and engender change. Mayer, who ran the search business at Google (GOOG) for many years, has brought in former colleagues in key positions at Yahoo. There is a sense not only that she brings technical acumen, but also that she has a deep understanding of the grand challenge facing every Internet company: namely, the fact that increasing use of mobile phones and tablets curtails the ability to easily monetize content through advertising. When people aren't sitting in front of a computer, getting them to click is increasingly difficult. MAYER'S ARRIVAL ON THE SCENE has a subtext, in that Valley types would very much like to see a really successful female tech CEO. Mayer's predecessor, Carol Bartz, who ran software maker Autodesk very well for several years, was shown the door at Yahoo! last year by the board of directors in a most unceremonious fashion. Yahoo's challenge, says Paul Saffo, a long-time Valley observer, is that it has never been particularly strong technologically. "They lost the battle for engineering talent early on" to Google and others, says Saffo. Not to mention the company has seen tremendous attrition in the years preceding Mayer's arrival. Yahoo! never put a mission in place to organize search as Google did, through sophisticated algorithms that leveraged the input of millions of Web surfers. Nor did it come up with a slick system to have advertisers set the price for ads through auctions, as did Google. Results have been dismal for years, and may be merely less bad this year, with revenue projected to slip 0.5% to $4.45 billion, after a 21% decline last year. Google's recent gains in display advertising, through properties such as YouTube, have doubtless come at the expense of Yahoo!, long the display ad titan. Where Google's third-quarter display-ad revenue may have risen by 50%, year over year, to $1.5 billion, according to analysts, Yahoo! saw its display revenue stay flat at $452 million. And now the company has seen the revolution in personal publishing carried away by the likes of Facebook, which is increasingly where many people spend significant time, or engagement, in advertising terms. Twitter is increasingly where we turn for news, in a grass-roots fashion, as was shown most spectacularly during last week's presidential election. But, as Saffo reminds us, Yahoo! has many prized properties buried within its heaps of content, such as Yahoo! Finance and the Yahoo! Groups discussion boards. "I use Yahoo! Groups way more than I use Google Groups," remarks Saffo. There ought to be a way to excavate some of those assets and monetize them better, in order to return Yahoo! to growth. Moreover, Mayer presides at a time when everyone, including Google and Facebook, is trying to figure out how to deal with the shift to mobile. Such periods of epic change can be a good time to tear things up and make bold innovations. The stock's valuation is close to a market multiple. It fetches 15.4 times this year's projected earnings of $1.12 per share; the estimate is the same for next year. When backing out about $6 per share in cash and investments, the stock fetches a more modest 10 times. That's leaving aside the $2.8 billion it's invested in Chinese e-commerce venture Alibaba Group Holdings and Yahoo! Japan, a partnership with Japanese investment firm Softbank. Those entities' fair market value is worth billions more. What should worry you is not the valuation, but the prospect that Mayer may not be bold enough. During the third-quarter conference call last month, her first as CEO, Mayer told Wall Street, "I don't think this is a situation where there's a giant pivot and we go into a completely different business." Let's hope she's playing possum. For this is, indeed, a pivot point, an inflection, a paradigm shift, or whatever jargon you prefer. A company that never had a technological mission desperately needs to claim its identity. As powerful data centers churn out incredible computing power and analyze every single move a Web user makes on every fast new gizmo in their hands, it's time to be aggressive, Ms. Mayer.</Msg><Username>naples2627</Username><Timestamp>1352595468946</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 19:57:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352600977633-18</Id><Topic><Title>Since Yahoo's new design looks so much like MSFT's can MSFT be in talks with Yahoo for a takeover?</Title><Username>optionstrader4u</Username><Timestamp>1352577140778</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 14:52:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think that Yahoo is going to take over Microsoft.</Msg><Username>still_my_dime</Username><Timestamp>1352600977633</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 21:29:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352602843769-19</Id><Title>Anyone have an idea how Yahoo will liquidate its Yahoo Japan shares without tanking the stock?</Title><Msg>It would take years to get out of that position without affecting the pps.</Msg><Username>optionstrader4u</Username><Timestamp>1352602843769</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 22:00:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352603653052-20</Id><Topic><Title>Barrons Marrissa</Title><Username>naples2627</Username><Timestamp>1352595468946</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 19:57:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With the cash on hand and their stake in Alibaba worth over 7 to 8 billion and its holdings in Yahoo Japan about 7+ billion Yahoo is trading at its post tax cash value if these were both liquidated. This is a put in the stock price at $17. That is why Yahoo is such a huge interest to anyone looking to take it over. The value of Alibaba once it goes public is between $50 and $150 billion. If people just knew how big this company was and that they have a corner on the Chinese e-business. To put it in perspective it would be like combining Ebay, Amazon, and the top b2b site all into one company. China has turned the corner as stated by the new Premier introduced on Friday. It has changed from a manufacturing to a consumer country. This is huge for Alibaba as most Chinese will use that site for years to come because they have all the infrastructure in place to make their purchases care free. Yahoo is a $30+ stock, imo and if Alibaba announces its ipo and it is bid up as most people think look out because yahoo's stake could be worth $20 billion in just that holding.
