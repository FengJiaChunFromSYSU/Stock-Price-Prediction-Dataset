Another great way to reduce storage requirements is to wake up your customer care unit and have them remove chronic abusers of the YHOO TOS agreement from these boards. About 85% of the posts on the YHOO finance boards are complete junk and many boards have a couple of village idiots who constantly harass other posters, spam, make off topic posts on politics and other matters, etc. For example, you might want to check out a poster on the STX board who posts under the IDs escapegll and vikesisamoron. A chronic abuser who for 10 years has harassed any poster with a postive view on STX with posts laced with obcsenities, lies, demeaning personalized rants, name calling (labeling everyone a psychopathic liar is standard), and homophobic and racial smears. This poster's pure intent is to disrupt the board and many feel he/she is a professional trader or a pitchfork being paid by someone to discredit positive views on STX and information exchange on the drive industry.. For years, NUMEROUS complaints have been made to YHOO customer care and NOTHING has been done!</Msg><Username>kramer_thek</Username><Timestamp>1364914491429</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:54:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>18</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364914637633-20</Id><Title>MIMV: Mobile apps play &amp; MSFT partner.

(NASDAQ: YHOO) has revealed that it will start using its rival Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) advertising services Adsense and AdMob as it looks to increase its revenue base. In an official blog post dated Feb 6, the company said that it has entered into a non-exclusive agreement for contextual advertising to be displayed on Yahoo and its co-branded sites for autos, finance, news and sports. This is in line with Yahoo’s CEO and former Google executive Marissa Mayer’s strategy to give a better experience to Yahoo’s users through more customized ads so that they can spend more time on Yahoo properties. Although Yahoo’s users won’t notice any significant change, it is almost certain that Yahoo will see increasing revenues through its partnership with Google.</Msg><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1364923505189</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 13:25:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364923692069-42</Id><Topic><Title>Hotmodel - Do you still think Yahoo was dead money at $15.80?</Title><Username>theecoldone</Username><Timestamp>1354722516724</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 10:48:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hotmodel has slithered away.</Msg><Username>remmy12554</Username><Timestamp>1364923692069</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 13:28:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364923774545-43</Id><Topic><Title>Hotmodel - Do you still think Yahoo was dead money at $15.80?</Title><Username>co1done</Username><Timestamp>1362587655224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-06 11:34:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hotmodel is speechless for a change.

Step 1: Yahoo advertiser penalized in SEC action. Step 2: Yahoo records reveal suppression of message board postings against that advertiser (Yahoo facilitates their activities as it were) at this point whether it's automated or discretionary is irrelevant.
