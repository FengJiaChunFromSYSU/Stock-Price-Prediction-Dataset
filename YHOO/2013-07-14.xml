I have said over and over again....NO HUDDLE OFFENSE is in full effect. You have a new management team that is trying, fighting, and executing aggressively. This is very telling. Sure they might have a miss here or there. But I rather see them fighting then sitting on their hands and just collecting their paycheck. I applaud the entire yahoo team. I have heard from numerous press sources that the energy level at yahoo is nothing like it was a year ago. People are coming in early and leaving late. Writing some kick #$%$ code. I think the sea of cultural change is taking hold. They are far from firing on all cylinders. However, I think the cylinders are now place. It will take time to fire them one at a time. And once that are all on fire, we should be at about $100/shr.

Cable TV operators are now competing with telco TV companies like Verizon and OTT video companies like Netflix. Cable TV operators need to invest heavily into offering their subscribers new innovative technologies in order to keep their customers.. There is a low float, undiscovered and very undervalued stock that pioneered video on demand (VOD) with TWC a decade ago and is now pioneering a new technology that will revolutionize cable TV, Network DVR (nDVR). The company is Concurrent (CCUR) and it looks ready to soar to new 52-week highs this week. CCUR became the first company to introduce VOD to the market in 2000 when they deployed it with TWC and today, VOD is the fastest growing alternative TV platform in the world - with CCUR's VOD delivery technology reaching 50 million subscribers for a 30% global market share. 1/2 of all U.S. TV households now have a DVR, but CCUR is about to make today's DVR boxes obsolete with new cloud-based nDVRs. CCUR's nDVR technology is already powering TWC's extremely popular start-over and look-back features. Soon, CCUR will begin deploying fully featured nDVR services for its pay-TV clients. CCUR's nDVR technology will allow consumers to record unlimited television content to their account over the cloud, without a DVR box - and play it back on any device - including tablets and smartphones. CCUR finished last week at $7.88 with a market cap of only $68.98 million, cash of $22.37 million, and an enterprise value of $46.61 million or just 0.74X revenues and 6.54X cash flow from operations. CCUR's top rival SEAC is about to reach a new 52-week high and is trading for 1.78X revenues and 15.92X cash flow from operations. SEAC's valuation ratios would value CCUR around $15.50 per share!</Msg><Username>asj48493</Username><Timestamp>1373846938786</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 20:08:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373847322252-18</Id><Topic><Title>$ _ WITHIN 3 TO 5 YEARS, YHOO STOCK WIL BE WORTH $250 PER SHARE _ $</Title><Username>rock_hard_80</Username><Timestamp>1372518189865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 11:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree!

In addition to these recent developments, DRAM will benefit from skyrocketing memory prices (it's main core business for the last several decades). DRAM was already on the verge of profitability even before the 2 factors mentioned above will have a significant positive effect on earnings in the current and future quarters, . The current 0.2 X sales compared to 1.5 sector average is ridiculous and will be corrected soon. DRAM’s current market cap is only $8 million. There only 1.4M tightly held shares on the float. 1) AMD and DRAM announced in May (5/8/2013 AMD Press Release and 5/12/2013 DRAMPress Release) that DRAM will begin manufacturing all new AMD Gamer Series memory modules and will provide it's RAMDisk software to drive all AMD Radeon products. The Gamer Series memory is compatible with AMD and Intel platforms, supporting both AMP and XMP memory profiles. Recent reviews rank AMD Gamer Series memory the fastest and more reliable for gaming and other applications requiring super-fast processing speeds. "AMD Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series Memory is armed with features designed to outperform the competition on any task," said Roman Kyrychynskyi, product director, Graphics Business Unit, AMD. "Designed with multi-platform compatibility in mind, the AMD Radeon RG2133 brings cutting-edge technology, as well as uncompromising quality and compatibility for PC gamers. "AMD and Dataram have worked together to significantly enhance the dynamic background load-and-save feature in order to create a seamless, non-volatile RAMDisk experience," said Jason Caulkins, CTO, Dataram. "This underscores AMD and Dataram's continued dedication to delivering the highest-performing memory products. 2) DRAM is also pursuing it's RAMDisk technology in the energy, banking, simulations, military, medical, and other sectors requiring super-fast processing speeds</Msg><Username>dianakibsion</Username><Timestamp>1373847455980</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 20:17:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373847730762-20</Id><Topic><Title>$ _ WITHIN 3 TO 5 YEARS, YHOO STOCK WIL BE WORTH $250 PER SHARE _ $</Title><Username>rock_hard_80</Username><Timestamp>1372518189865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 11:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When I looked back to 1999 the Shareprice was 108.50</Msg><Username>ottmar.schuhmacher</Username><Timestamp>1373847730762</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 20:22:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373848170510-21</Id><Topic><Title>$ _ WITHIN 3 TO 5 YEARS, YHOO STOCK WIL BE WORTH $250 PER SHARE _ $</Title><Username>rock_hard_80</Username><Timestamp>1372518189865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 11:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There has been stock splits since then.</Msg><Username>slerxzy</Username><Timestamp>1373848170510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 20:29:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373849295211-22</Id><Topic><Title>$ _ WITHIN 3 TO 5 YEARS, YHOO STOCK WIL BE WORTH $250 PER SHARE _ $</Title><Username>rock_hard_80</Username><Timestamp>1372518189865</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-29 11:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have a good explaination about the Stockmarket in itself , on one side you got them RETail Investors , I call them the little Fish, then on the other side you have them Insiders from each Company they have the Inside Info and know when to sell and they receive so many Shares for nothing practicly so they know when to sell there options when the Stock is at highest point .
