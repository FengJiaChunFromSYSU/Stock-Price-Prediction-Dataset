How FB grab yahoo address book without yahoo password is troublesome - tells me either yahoo is complicit or yahoo security is lax and FB has it codes. Point is, FB already steals or gets data from Yahoo registered users who also uses FB account. FB is brazen, crooked and that is why they have to settle with FTC or is it FCC, over the issue of illegally tampering with user accounts. FB won't pay for yahoo if they can just steal their information. Yahoo search is worthless so there is no asset in FB that is worth legally absorbing in its fold.</Msg><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1345096764935</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 01:59:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345096830541-4</Id><Topic><Title>I see a big belly but no money for the shareholders.</Title><Username>jewhoo1</Username><Timestamp>1345072457090</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 19:14:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i don't know what your commission fees are but it sounds like your getting ripped off! i have no limit on shares bought or sold at 7.00 per trade &amp; they gave me loads of free trades! scottrade securities! my commission charges isn't even a factor to consider when trading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>matsky5</Username><Timestamp>1345096830541</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 02:00:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345097291582-5</Id><Topic><Title>Read between lines - Yahoo to be acquired</Title><Username>jkellynewyork</Username><Timestamp>1345056694248</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 14:51:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i'll bet in her contract it indicates she will receive full benefits &amp; the stock options will be fully earned at the buyout price! she isn't dumb &amp; would demand it! also yahoo feeds funds to ceos like candy! look at her present benefits!</Msg><Username>matsky5</Username><Timestamp>1345097291582</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 02:08:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345111753458-6</Id><Title>YHOO, Cash, and Nov 2012</Title><Msg>Painting w/a broad brush, if by Nov 2012, and shd the stock price be ~$15/shr, YHOO will have a mkt cap of ~ $17 bln or so and ~ $10 bln in cash, with hardly any debt!

Look at how much cash this comp will have (if they don't spend it) by Nov! Throwing in the cash, someone (MSFT?) can actually 'buy' YHOO in Nov for ~ 60% of $18/shr!

The key is that MSFT doesn't want to deal with Alibaba and Yahoo Japan. Even if there is money to be made, that distracts their business focus. They want Yahoo core, and that is it! They want the search, they want the media, they want the database, they want the user base and that is all they want. They will pay a premium for Yahoo as they paid for Skype, if someone like Dan Loeb would come in and break Yahoo up cleanly. Keep in mind, Even if we value core at 15 billion, it is still much better deal then what MSFT paid for Skype. Yahoo core is a loaded gun for profit. It has so much user base and it has the best social media potential. It connects TV entertainment, Movie entertainment and spawn it across 700 million users via email logins. My nephew and nieces used to use Facebook, then earlier this year, they dropped out and started to use Twitter, and just last month, they discovered Yahoo and started to experiment with Yahoo Bar. I am telling you, Yahoo is a giant waiting to be awaken. Any company, such as MSFT, Apple, FACebook ... if one of them get a hold of Yahoo Core, it is a check mate for the rest. In the mean time, MSFT will pay millions to ask Goldman or Mckinsey to tell them the same thing.... lol... oh, well, that is the way earth spins.</Msg><Username>fpl1971</Username><Timestamp>1345119738760</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 08:22:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345122793421-11</Id><Title>Reg FD and Yahoo value</Title><Msg>If Yahoo mgt is discussing other strategic alternatives for Yahoo with its BOD including representatives of major investors, it better be darn sure that it discloses those to retail investors in a timely and comprehensive manner or it may run afoul of Reg FD and fall into the same jeopardy as the FB underwriters and mgt.</Msg><Username>mesondk</Username><Timestamp>1345122793421</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345122795045-12</Id><Topic><Title>i still think it will be</Title><Username>pebble.again</Username><Timestamp>1345121518763</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 08:51:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>msft doesn't want alibaba or yahoo japan. so it will try to buy Yahoo at 15 to 18 a share. the only way for this to happen if Dan loeb buys yahoo first and then break it apart and sell them in parts.

And $25 would have to be taken by YHOO BOD unless there is a bigger bid. Why would they not do this?

It is suppose to be an ID that FB keeps on file in case one loses password, but FB is sneaky, they actually dig in to your yahoo email and takes the address book. How they do it without yahoo email password? who knows but I guess they have hacking power to do it. People have complained which is why there was a recent settlement between FB and FCC. FB would steal info rather than pay for it.</Msg><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1345139517233</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 13:51:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345140921823-39</Id><Topic><Title>Is Marissa here to pave YHOO for acquisition BY Facebook?</Title><Username>irrational_fed_selloff</Username><Timestamp>1345066249384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 17:30:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>40% premium over closing price is the norm of a under valued company like Yahoo. If it is $25 Billion, acquirer can do half stock half cash and YHOO has the cash equivalent asset to pay for itself. GOOG submitted term sheet to buy YHOO ad tech division.... Marissa prob said to Serg and Larry why not buy the whole thing at $25 Bil and YHOO has at least $15 Bil cash and cash equivalent to cover the whole enchilada..... like paying for the whole MEDIA company (CNBC, NBC, etc alliance built in) at less than half the price. So you ask why Loeb "hired" MArissa shortly after GOOG submitte the term sheet to "buy ad tech division" ? The lady engineer is 6-month pregnant BUT all you need is 3 months or less to submit a term sheet to buy the whole YAHOO.

Augme Technologies released the following update on the company's on-going patent enforcement activities, including its seven federal lawsuits involving four of the company's issued U.S. patents. Augme Technologies vs. Yahoo! (YHOO): On Aug. 9, the Court found, given the evidence presented, that the accused Yahoo! systems could not be found to infringe under the Court's interpretation of Augme's claims. The Court did not rule on invalidity issues raised by Yahoo!. Augme's CEO, Paul Arena said, "We continue to believe Yahoo!'s activities and products infringe the patents asserted against it as well as other patents in our portfolio not yet asserted against them. The final chapter on Augme's dispute with Yahoo! has yet to be written." Augme continues to maintain that Yahoo!'s targeted marketing systems use Augme's patented technology and constitutes an infringement of its patent portfolio that the company will ultimately resolve through licensing or litigation. The company is considering an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, DC, the highest patent court, of the summary judgment ruling by U.S. District Court. Augme also is exploring opportunities in conjunction with third party licensing partners to move its licensing program forward.</Msg><Username>xetra72</Username><Timestamp>1345149629071</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 16:40:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345149693563-47</Id><Title>Y!
