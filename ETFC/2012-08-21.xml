His House website indicates that he earned a BS in management engineering from Worcester Polytechnical Institute. Interestingly, this official biography fails to note that he also earned a Master of Divinity at Covenant Theological Seminary in St. Louis.

In the spring of 2010, Senate majority leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) was widely considered the most vulnerable incumbent up for reelection. His campaign interceded in the Republican race for the nomination to take him on, attacking the candidate he considered most threatening. Sharron Angle, the candidate he feared least, won the nomination and then lost in November. This year, Senator Claire McCaskill (D., Mo.) is the most vulnerable incumbent up for reelection, and she has learned from Reid’s example. She is trying to get the candidate she fears least to win the Republican nomination. But she is going about it in a slightly different way: “attacking” that candidate in terms likely to make Republican primary voters warm to him. The polls in the Republican primary have been fluid, and it seems as though businessman John Brunner, Representative Todd Akin, and former state treasurer Sarah Steelman are all in serious contention one week before the vote. Conservatives are split. Steelman has Sarah Palin’s endorsement, for example, while the Chamber of Commerce is blasting her voting record on taxes, tort reform, and economic conservatism generally. McCaskill, though, seems to have a clear favorite in the race: Todd Akin. Watch her ads against the Republican trio here. The ad “against” Akin calls him a “true conservative” and “a crusader against bigger government,” and refers to his “pro-family agenda.” The ad against Brunner, on the other hand, attacks him for not being a “reliable conservative.” The ad against Steelman is tough, too. Harry Reid’s PAC is playing in the race, too, trashing Brunner’s business record. All of which seems to suggest that Democrats want to run against Akin the most, and may want to run against Brunner the least. The Democrats may believe that Akin’s relative lack of interest in fundraising and his religious conservatism make him the weakest of the Republican candidates. Parties have, however, been known to get these sorts of calculations wrong. It is hard to see how the Republicans can take the Senate without this seat. At the moment Rasmussen shows all three Republicans beating McCaskill, with Akin having the smallest margin.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345526644000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 01:24:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345536395000-7</Id><Title>Futures are skyrocketing now!!!!!</Title><Msg>http://www.cnbc.com/id/17689937/site/14081545/ Europe is up huge!!!</Msg><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1345536395000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 04:06:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345538488000-8</Id><Topic><Title>$8.88, Repeat After Me!! $8.88, $8.88!!</Title><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1345493863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 16:17:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.cnbc.com/id/17689937/site/14081545/ Futures are up huge!!!</Msg><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1345538488000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 04:41:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345556468000-9</Id><Title>Bought NYT 9.37</Title><Msg>could be wrong... tdc</Msg><Username>tradedotcom</Username><Timestamp>1345556468000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 09:41:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345558574000-10</Id><Title>What's happening?</Title><Msg>Something be up.

This sounds terrific. Why didn’t we think of it sooner? Mr. Romney says that he can achieve this seemingly magical result by “broadening the base” for income tax collection. This, too, sounds great. In principle, everyone favors “broadening the base,” also known as closing loopholes. But everyone favors closing someone else’s loopholes: those of oil companies, say, or of plutocrats who park their money in the Cayman Islands. Unfortunately, such inviting targets, to the extent they exist, don’t cost the government much in the overall scheme of things. The “loopholes” that cost most are deductions and other tax provisions that most Americans consider sensible, if not God-given, rights: tax breaks for employer-provided health insurance, which according to the Congressional Budget Office will cost $2 trillion over the next 10 years; for pension and retirement savings ($1.8 trillion); for mortgage interest ($1.6 trillion) and charitable giving ($600 billion). Mr. Romney hasn’t said which of these he would trim or by how much. Recently the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, showed that Mr. Romney’s plan would by necessity help the rich and hurt the middle class. In an interview with Fortune magazine last week, Mr. Romney took strong issue with this conclusion. “They made garbage assumptions and they reached a garbage conclusion,” he said. Contrary to the center’s assumption, he said, he would not take away middle-class tax breaks for “homeownership, charitable giving and health care.”</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345559424000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:30:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345559644000-13</Id><Topic><Title>Mittiot's magic mix</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345559424000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:30:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poll: Most Opposed To Ryan’s Medicare Reforms, Voucher System A new poll released Tuesday lends credence to what Democrats — and even some Republicans — have warned about Paul Ryan being thrust onto the GOP ticket: Most Americans don’t much care for the Wisconsin Congressman’s sweeping proposal to reform Medicare. The latest survey from Democratic-leaning Public Policy Polling (PPP), conducted on behalf of the Daily Kos and Service Employees International Union (SEIU), shows that 45 percent of registered voters are opposed to Ryan’s proposed reforms to Medicare, while 36 percent support his proposal. -snip- But PPP delved deeper with its next question, shifting from general language (“Do you support or oppose Paul Ryan’s proposal for reforming Medicare?”) to a specific reference to the Medicare voucher program — causing support for Ryan’s Medicare plan to erode even further. Sixty-three percent of voters say that Medicare should not be replaced with vouchers to allow the elderly to buy private insurance, while only 19 percent support the voucher plan. Worse for Ryan, only 29 percent of Republicans support the voucher plan. That’s higher than the 6 percent of Democrats and 22 percent of independents who support the plan, but it still represents the minority position in the GOP: 44 percent of Republicans say Medicare should not be replaced with a voucher system. Polls have consistently shown low support for Ryan’s proposed changes to Medicare, underscoring the vulnerabilities in Romney’s vice presidential pick.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345559644000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:34:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345560436000-14</Id><Topic><Title>Another Fisker Goes Flambe'!...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1345502553000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 18:42:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's right gerbil bankrupt everybody transferring money from the masses to a select few "blessed" energy companies that have proven to make minimal progress. how many human beings can you force onto the governement bread lines while you chase the perpetual motion machine?</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1345560436000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:47:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345560513000-15</Id><Title>Drifting or drinving higher?</Title><Msg>Volume today is b*lls to the w*lls.</Msg><Username>orland_kravitz</Username><Timestamp>1345560513000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:48:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345560733000-16</Id><Topic><Title>What's happening?</Title><Username>orland_kravitz</Username><Timestamp>1345558574000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How about the fact the overall market is simply melting up?

According to the reports, the documents showed that Ryan also brought in $5.4 million for local bus services. His requests came at the same time he was publicly calling the stimulus a “wasteful spending spree.” However, in an interview with a local Ohio television news station, Ryan claimed he never secured funding through the program, saying “I never asked for stimulus.” Watch it, courtesy of local ABC affiliate 9 News. The Associated Press wrote a follow-up story to Ryan’s comments: Ryan’s statement directly counters the evidence of four letters obtained by the AP which the congressman wrote to Energy Secretary Steven Chu, praising energy programs supported by the stimulus and requesting funds for initiatives in his district. Ryan’s private praise for Department of Energy programs and his written requests for stimulus funds contradict not only his public criticism of the 2009 stimulus bill, but also many of the budget priorities he has laid out, including cuts to investments in green technologies. Raising further questions about the vice presidential candidate’s claim today that he never sought stimulus money, Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck referred AP to previous explanations by the congressman’s office that by requesting funds Ryan was simply “providing a legitimate constituent service.” Ryan is one of dozens of Congressional Republicans who have actively lobbied the government for loan guarantees and grants for clean energy companies in their districts — even while many of them railed on the stimulus program in the press.

That cynical ploy of the Romney/Ryan plan to gut Medicare, but to keep the senior vote by putting those cuts off on the next batch of retirees is looking increasingly empty. That's because their plan to repeal Obamacare, and to "restore" the $716 billion in provider cuts means that Romney/Ryan will either have to make up those funds with revenues or with cuts to current seniors, because without that money, Medicare becomes insolvent by 2016. The Republican allergy to new revenue pretty much determines they'll squeeze that money out of seniors, and Romney advisors are admitting it. Romney campaign advisor Ed Gillespie was the first to admit they'd target current seniors by raising the eligibility age for Medicare. And now another advisor is admitting that benefits cuts are definitely on the table. Avik Roy, an outside health care adviser to the Romney campaign, admits that committing to billions of dollars in higher Medicare spending in the near-term will make it difficult for Romney to achieve its separate goal of reducing overall federal spending to modern lows. But he notes thatRomney could make up the difference elsewhere in the budget or, by “mak[ing] other changes to the Medicare program, such as increased means-testing, that don’t alter the program’s basic structure.” Means testing would apply to people on Medicare now, and it would be a cut to benefits, benefits that retirees earned through years of work and contributing to the system. That's not the only thing seniors would be losing under Romney/Ryan. If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, with it goes the $4.1 billion seniors and disabled people have saved on prescription drugs. That amounts to an average of $768 in annual savings for Medicare patients, a significant chunk of money for anyone on a fixed income. Also gone with repeal are the free cancer screenings, mammograms and other preventive services. Romney and Ryan are lying, no surprise, when they say that anyone on Medicare now won't see a change in their benefits. They're playing a shell game with American seniors.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345563425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:37:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345563483000-27</Id><Title>Tom Harkin believes young girls have painful periods</Title><Msg>Take it from the femnist tom.

Great news, everyone. We no longer need to be upset that Rep. Todd Akin, an actual member of the House and an actual Senate candidate, said that women have magical ladyparts to protect them from rape sperm when they are victims of "legitimate rape." Because that's not what he meant at all. As he explained on Mike Huckabee's radio show: I was talking about forcible rape. I used the wrong word. Ohhhh. Well, obviously talking about "legitimate rape" is totally out of line. But talking about "forcible rape"? That just makes everything better, doesn't it? It also puts him in line with the rest of the Republican Party—including, of course, the party's vice presidential nominee, Rep. Paul Ryan: Paul Ryan also co-sponsored HR 3, the "No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion" bill in which Republicans tried to redefine rape so that it only applied to "forcible" rape so those fake rape victims would stop exploiting loopholes to cash in on fabulous gifts and prizes. Republicans pulled that part out of the bill so everyone would stop criticizing them, and then they tried to sneak it back in anyway. The Romney campaign took the oh-so-bold step on Sunday night of announcing that "Governor Romney and Congressman Ryan disagree with Mr. Akin’s statement." This morning, after thinking about it, Romney added that Akin's comments were "offensive": “Congressman’s Akin comments on rape are insulting, inexcusable, and, frankly, wrong,” Romney said. “Like millions of other Americans, we found them to be offensive.” [...] “I have an entirely different view,” Romney said. “What he said is entirely without merit and he should correct it.” But now Akin has explained that he holds the same position as Romney's running mate: that there is a distinction between "forcible rape" and not-really-rape. So, Mitt, are you still offended? Do you still disagree? Still hold an "entirely different view"?

Saving program which is going down the drain without making any changes is impossible. So, lets present seniors their choices and see which one they like. Bet it ain't gonna be Obamacare.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1345564560000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:56:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345564641000-30</Id><Title>$8.93 is a next resistance but will pass ...</Title><Msg>$8.93 is a next resistance but will pass this week!!

Originally, banks and lenders were supposed to pay 50 percent of the cost of reducing the principal for those whose homes are worth less than their mortgage. But when the banks refused, California took the controversial step of paying the entire amount, up to $100,000. "We thought, you know, 50-50 was much more attractive and we'd have much more traction with lenders, and it just didn't turn out to work as well as we would have liked," said Diane Richardson, legislative director of the California Housing Finance Agency. The program, known as the Hardest Hit Housing Market fund, is part of a $7.6 billion federal effort to help underwater homeowners in 18 states. California received $2 billion. But when banks and lenders who service loans refused to write down even a small portion of the negative equity loans, California decided to use the taxpayer money to pay 100 percent of the mortgage reduction. Richard Green, a professor of real estate at the University of Southern California, said it's not what taxpayers signed up for. "I think taxpayers would be furious at the idea that everybody gets completely off the hook for this," Green said. "There are people that say, look, I've been a renter all these years, I've been paying my mortgage all these years, why am I bailing out these people who made a bad decision? I think the politics of it are very combustible."</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1345568932000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 13:08:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345569340000-45</Id><Topic><Title>Mittiot to cut Medicare</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345563425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:37:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sure, just like how in gop world nobody looks at prices for medical services and the insurance cos just pay any price for any procedure for anybody. moron. and if romneyann plan is so good , why didn't ryan offer to let his MOM choose it, instead of parading her to assure seniors that THEY WOULD NOT be getting his "premium support" vouchers..... they had to be assured they will CONTINUE to get the full AS IS medicare. funny huh? that those seniors and his mom weren't demanding Ryan "premium support" NOW......</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345569340000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 13:15:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345569387000-46</Id><Title>Mittiot the "backstabber"</Title><Msg>Wed Aug 15, 2012 at 09:01 PM PDT Republican Senator Calls Romney a "Stupid Back Stabber" (Updated) by Billionaires for Wealthcare Responding to Romney's plan to kill energy production and thousands of jobs in Iowa, long time conservative Senator Chuck Grassley called Romney "stupid" and a "back stabber" at two town hall meetings.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345569387000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 13:16:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345569605000-47</Id><Title>Competitive Disadvantage</Title><Msg>What's next? Scottrade has some tough decisions to make. On one hand, it has made a commitment to its customers to provide ETFs that will now be gone. Granted, the lack of success from those ETFs suggests that customers didn't really get on board and so won't necessarily miss them that much. But with competitors still going strong with their offerings, the failure puts Scottrade at a competitive disadvantage unless it takes action to replace the closed funds with others. For other brokerage players, Scottrade's experience only stresses the highly competitive nature of the ETF industry right now. With the strongest players seeing further gains, those that played catch-up by latching onto more speculative ETF providers could end up feeling the same pain that Scottrade is going through now.</Msg><Username>busser_hyman</Username><Timestamp>1345569605000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 13:20:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345569636000-48</Id><Topic><Title>Mittiot to cut Medicare</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345563425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:37:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can't give away Romneyvouchers, no one will trade their Medicare for them.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345569636000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 13:20:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345569864000-49</Id><Topic><Title>Mittiot to cut Medicare</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345563425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:37:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;&lt;and if romneyann plan is so good , why didn't ryan offer to let his MOM choose it&gt;&gt; I don't want to wise up a chump here, but it doesn't exist, so how is he going to offer it to anyone...geeez!</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1345569864000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 13:24:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345569999000-50</Id><Topic><Title>See this profile chart (ETFC)</Title><Username>thelmayiy30704</Username><Timestamp>1345560936000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 10:55:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what I am looking for.</Msg><Username>townsend_heather596</Username><Timestamp>1345569999000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 13:26:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345570895000-51</Id><Topic><Title>Mittiot to cut Medicare</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345563425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:37:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>•Nothing changes for current seniors or those nearing retirement 100% Correct statement.

Which is still not a person. Great timing, guys: Republicans drafting their party's official policy platform on Tuesday ratified a call for a Constitutional ban on abortion that makes no exceptions for rape or incest. The vote to endorse the party's long-standing opposition to abortion and support for a "human life amendment" took place at a meeting of the GOP's official platform committee in Tampa, the site of next week's Republican National Convention. The party's official stance on abortion was approved after just a few minutes of discussion. [...] "Faithful to the 'self-evident' truths enshrined in the Declaration of Independence, we assert the sanctity of human life and affirm that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed," the platform language declares. "We support a human life amendment to the Constitution and endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children." Of course it took them only a few minutes to officially adopt the position that is already the official position of the Republican Party. All in favor of continuing to take rights away from women? Probably a unanimous "aye" on that. What makes it awkward, of course, is that, as Jed Lewison explained, "There is no daylight at all between Todd Akin's position on abortion and the GOP's official position on abortion." So while Republicans are running around pretending they're offended by what Akin said, they just voted to support what Akin said. Here's the comedy gold, though: RNC's @Reince on abortion in GOP platform: 'This is the platform of the Republican Party; this is not the platform of Mitt Romney." — @mpoindc via Seesmic twhirl Republicans are trying to pretend that the party's "let's amend the Constitution to super-s****w women" position is somehow different from the not-as-radical position of the Romney/Ryan ticket. That way, Republicans can appeal to their rabid base while also trying to claim to the moderate and not-bugpoke-insane voters that President Romney and Vice President Ryan won't be that bad. Just one little problem with that: Paul Ryan co-sponsored the Sanctity of Life Act, which defines a fertilized egg as a person and grants it "all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood." No exceptions. Okay, two little problems: HUCKABEE: Would you have supported a constitutional amendment that would have established the definition of life at conception? ROMNEY: Absolutely. The entire Republican Party believes this crapola, from Todd Akin to Mitt Romney and all the Republicans in between. Anyone who disagrees is forced out of the party. (Cough Arlen Specter cough.) They can pretend to be "offended" by Akin all the want, but he was just saying what they all believe. And now it's official.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345572461000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 14:07:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345573653000-55</Id><Title>Akin won't quit</Title><Msg>Todd Akin reaffirms decision to stay in the Senate race Source: Washington Post Rep.

Obviously with batteries that store enough power to move both the batteries, the frame of a safe care, its passengers, AND its cargo (groceries) the need for efficient storage is key, so key that maybe they overlooked energy containment when reaching for it. Right now combustible room temperature liquids are about the best way to contain and store energy combined with a device for converting it from chemical potential to mechanical kinetic energy through a heat engine. Anyone has any better ideas, apply at the patent office.

Todd Akin (R-MO). Akin, who is also currently the Republican candidate for the Senate in the Show Me State, explained that victims of “legitimate rapes” are not likely to become pregnant and thus should not enjoy abortion rights: “It seems to me, from what I understand from doctors, that’s really rare. If it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or something: I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be of the rapist, and not attacking the child.” For the record, more than 32,000 women get pregnant because of rape each year in America. While Akin walked back and later apologized for his comments, condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans alike was swift and fierce. And today, virtually every leading Republican with the exception of Mitt Romney declared that Akin should drop his Senate bid. Due to Missouri election law and Akin’s own declarations today, it appears that Akin is very likely to remain the GOP candidate despite financial abandonment from Karl Rove’s Crossroads GPS and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Akin did find some defenders among influential conservative groups, including the American Family Association, Red State’s Erick Erickson (who is also a CNN contributor), Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, and the Susan B. Anthony List.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345593213000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 19:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345593244000-99</Id><Topic><Title>GOP in your lady parts</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345593213000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 19:53:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Anti-Woman Ticket What’s perhaps even more shocking than Akin’s comments is the fact that a majority of elected Republicans appear to share his general views on parsing the definition of what counts as rape and what doesn’t, as well as his radical views on numerous other vital women’s health issues. None other than vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan (R-WI) has teamed up with Akin on a personhood measure that would ban abortion in all circumstances as well as outlaw common forms of birth control, a bill to redefine rape, and even a bill that would allow hospitals to let women die rather than perform a life-saving abortion. The latter two measures were actually among the first measures passed by the House of Representatives after Republicans took over in 2011. A closer look at the views of the Romney-Ryan ticket reveals the depths of its hostility toward women’s issues: In 2007, Mitt Romney said he would “delighted” to sign a national ban on abortion, which he described as “wonderful” and terrific.” Both Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have supported radical personhood measures that would ban abortion in all circumstances, as well as outlaw common forms of birth control and in vitro fertilization. They both also support the Human Life Amendment, which would overturn Roe v. Wade.The Republican National Committee will actually vote tomorrow on including this particular anti-choice measure in the official GOP platform. Ryan has voted to defund Planned Parenthood and end the Title X family planning program and Mitt Romney has pledge to “get rid of” federal funding for Planned Parenthood and Title X should he be elected president. Both oppose requiring insurers to offer no-cost birth control coverage and they supported the Blunt Amendment, which would allow your boss to deny you insurance coverage for anything for any reason at all. Both would repeal the Affordable Care Act (as Ryan has actually voted to do dozens of times) and its numerous benefits for women. Ryan voted against the Lilly Ledbetter Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act, while Romney has refused to take positions on these key pieces of equal pay legislation. BOTTOM LINE: The GOP’s war on women runs far deeper than Todd Akin’s shocking comments. By selecting Paul Ryan as his running mate, Mitt Romney has made clear that he sides with the GOP’s most extreme forces on the social issues important to women and their families."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345593244000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 19:54:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345593425000-100</Id><Topic><Title>THEE place for pup tents</Title><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1298756806000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-02-26 16:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mauled out sunshine.</Msg><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1345593425000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 19:57:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345593462000-101</Id><Topic><Title>THEE place for pup tents</Title><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1298756806000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-02-26 16:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are miles and miles and miles of forgotten tunnels below NYC.</Msg><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1345593462000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 19:57:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345593501000-102</Id><Topic><Title>THEE place for pup tents</Title><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1298756806000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-02-26 16:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I saw several world famous attractions this past weekend.</Msg><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1345593501000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 19:58:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345594919000-103</Id><Title>he ain't heavy, he's my brother</Title><Msg>So much for spreading the wealth around...what happened to he is my brothers keeper. Update On Obama’s Brother Living In a Hut A few days ago I received a call from a man I recently met named George. He was a bit flustered, and soon informed me that his young son was sick with a chest condition. He pleaded with me to send him $1,000 to cover the medical bills. Since George was at the hospital I asked him to let me speak to a nurse, and she confirmed that George’s son was indeed ill. So I agreed to send George the money through Western Union. He was profusely grateful. But before I hung up I asked George, “Why are you coming to me?” He said, “I have no one else to ask.” Then he said something that astounded me, “Dinesh, you are like a brother to me.” Actually, George has a real life brother who just happens to be the president of the United States. (George Obama is the youngest of eight children sired by Barack Obama Sr.) George’s brother is a multimillionaire and the most powerful man in the world. Moreover, George’s brother has framed his re-election campaign around the “fair share” theme that we owe obligations to those who are less fortunate. One of Obama’s favorite phrases comes right out of the Bible: “We are our brother’s keeper.” Yet he has not contributed a penny to help his own brother. And evidently George does not believe, even in times of emergency, that he can turn to his brother in the White House for help.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1345594919000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 20:21:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>24</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345595618000-104</Id><Topic><Title>he ain't heavy, he's my brother</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1345594919000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 20:21:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1KtScrqtbc</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1345595618000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 20:33:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345599396000-105</Id><Title>Scarborough trashes Mittiot</Title><Msg>View profile Scarborough: Romney welfare ads are "completely false" Source: The Hill Joe Scarborough on Morning Joe today, responding to Mitt Romney's series of TV ads (here, here, and here), claiming that Barack Obama has gutted welfare reform.

Now take whatever number you've got in your head and go lower. According to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, President Obama is beating his Republican opponent among black voters by a whopping 94 percent to 0 percent. The numbers are pretty brutal for Romney among Latinos, as well: he's losing to the president almost 2 to 1. The poll has President Obama ahead among all registered voters, 48 percent to Romney's 44 percent. The numbers aren't a complete surprise. The Republican party has fared poorly with black voters for decades. But there was a moment in the mid-aughts when the GOP was starting to see hints of progress. Both Bob Dole and George W. Bush actively courted conservative black voters and even managed to eek into double digits. (Not a small accomplishment, considering Democrats regularly won 90-plus percent of black voters in national contests for decades.) In 2005, Ken Mehlman, who was then running the Republican National Committee, even apologized to black leaders for the party's use of racially divisive tactics, in a gesture that suggested that Republicans were making a serious play to slice off bits of the black electorate. But Barack Obama's campaign in the 2008 upended even those meager gains. Obama won 96 percent of the black vote in an election that also saw unprecedented African American turnout. Mitt Romney addressed the NAACP in July to make his pitch to African Americans. "With 90 percent of African Americans voting for Democrats, some of you may wonder why a Republican would bother to campaign in the African-American community, and to address the NAACP," Romney said to the audience. "Of course, one reason is that I hope to represent all Americans, of every race, creed or sexual orientation, from the poorest to the richest and everyone in between." Although Romney was greeted with polite applause, he did manage to ruffle some feathers during his address. He was jeered when he said he would repeal president Obama's healthcare law. "If you're looking for a president who will make things better for the African-American community, you're looking at him," Romney said to boos and snickering. One NAACP official claimed that Romney flew in black supporters to applaud him. On the other side of the ledger, the poll shows the president pulling in around 40 percent of white voters, which would be a historic low for a winning candidate if he's re-elected in November. (No Democrat has won the white vote since 1964, the year President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law.) A report released in July found that President Obama would need to improve upon his record 2008 showing with black voters or he would struggle mightily in several key states that remain up for grabs."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345601415000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:10:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345605447000-108</Id><Topic><Title>he ain't heavy, he's my brother</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1345594919000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 20:21:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"George has a real life brother who just happens" George is Obama's half brother from a father he only lived with for 3 years.

Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) has increasingly held himself to a higher standard than the rest of Congress when it comes to what he considered wasteful federal spending. Ryan emerged as one of the harshest critics of President Obama's stimulus bill. He rose to greater prominence for his forceful stances against earmarks -- imposing a moratorium, pushing for transparency, and urging higher ethical standards. The anti-earmark stance was not without risk: It led him to link up with his then-liberal counterpart in the Senate, Sen. Russ Feingold, in proposing legislation for a presidential line-item veto that would target "bridge-to-nowhere" style earmarks in 2007. "We have to drain the earmark swamp," Ryan was quoted as saying in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel story. By the end of that year, Ryan had signed a pledge that would sever links between campaign donations and earmarks. It's a tough standard to live up to. And one that not even Ryan could maintain. Ryan has pushed for earmarks around the same time he started complaining about the practice. He also lobbied for stimulus money while objecting to President Obama's spending bill. And in at least two instances involving the Department of Transportation, Ryan has pushed the interests of companies whose members have given him campaign donations, according to records obtained by The Huffington Post. Steering transportation funds, or weighing in on regulations, is one of the most direct ways a congressman can exert influence. Ryan is certainly not the only politician to attempt to influence the DOT over its decision making. But the fact that Ryan was willing to go to bat on behalf of campaign donors drives against the narrative Ryan has long claimed -- that he is a special kind of politician, more saint than sinner.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345607690000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:54:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345607750000-111</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan legislative record</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345607690000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:54:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ryan's spokesman said the newly minted vice presidential nominee has done nothing improper. "The folks who have contributed to Congressman Ryan over the years have done so because they support his vision and agenda, not the other way around," Brendan Buck, Ryan's spokesman, said via email. In 2004, Ryan wrote Norman Mineta, the Secretary of Transportation, on behalf of the chemical company PPG Industries. The company's PAC has contributed $6,750 to Ryan's campaign coffers from 1998 through 2012. Ryan began by saying he was "writing to share the concerns" of the company over a proposed rule concerning the transportation of hazardous materials. What were those concerns? The proposed rule would give the DOT and OSHA combined jurisdiction over hazardous materials. But the industry wanted OSHA to stay out of it. Ryan expressed no opinion other than PPG's own about those nettlesome regulations. "In their current form, PPG Industries believes that the new regulations are confusing, may be inconsistent with existing federal law and may lead to conflicting and possibly onerous regulatory actions by local authorities," Ryan wrote in his August 10, 2004 letter to Mineta. "I would like a further explanation of how the DOT plans to meet various concerns that were raised by the shipping and receiving industry and the businesses that utilize their services." Two months later, Ryan got a response from Mineta. The transportation secretary said a final decision on the rule had been delayed multiple times due to industry concerns and was still up for consideration. He then emphasized the regulation's importance in clarifying responsibilities and oversight concerning worker and environmental hazards. The provisions would also provide national standards "for the transportation of hazardous material in commerce that are consistent with Federal hazmat law and with the statutes authorizing the hazardous materials regulatory programs administered by OSHA and EPA." The rule went into effect in 2005.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345607750000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:55:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345607783000-112</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan legislative record</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345607690000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:54:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a statement provided to HuffPost, a PPG spokesperson wrote: "In general, PPG believes in participating in the governmental process in the nations and communities in which it operates. This commitment includes participating in the political process, from engaging government officials to educating employees. PPG’s U.S. political action committee is fully funded by voluntary contributions, and disbursements are made to political candidates and parties as approved by the PAC’s contributions committee comprised of PPG executives." The company's spokesperson went on to write that "PPG runs its businesses using sound environment, health, safety and product stewardship practices, and communicates with the public and support the communities in which it operates." In 2007, Ryan, along with the Wisconsin delegation, wrote DOT to affirm support for Milwaukee-based Midwest Airlines' application for two slots at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. "The award of these slots," Ryan wrote, "will allow the airline to provide much needed capacity in the important nonstop Milwaukee-DCA market." Ryan pushed for Midwest to get slots in two letters to DOT in 2008. Midwest, by then, had only been awarded backup status. Again, DOT rebuffed Ryan. In 2007 and 2008, Midwest executives gave Ryan $1,450 in campaign contributions, records show. Midwest has since merged with another company. It now flies under the Frontier name. That company did not respond to a request for comment. In 2009, when car dealers in Ryan's congressional district were upset over inefficiencies with Obama's "Cash for Clunkers" program, Ryan wrote a letter to Secretary Ray LaHood asking to hear what steps he might be taking to "alleviate the administrative gridlock and technical errors currently facing this system." The National Auto Dealers Association is a top contributor to Ryan, pouring $68,500 into his campaigns. In total, the automotive industry has donated $290,350 to Ryan's campaigns. LaHood did not respond to Ryan's complaints -- at least not in writing.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345607783000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:56:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
