Bush. Does the GOP really think that’s what the American people want? We know that we saw something appalling yesterday, in Mitt Romney’s response to the violence in Cairo and Benghazi, but let’s not lose sight of the fact that we’re witnessing something historic too. This isn’t simply the end of the Republican Party’s decades-long political advantage on foreign policy that we’re observing. Rather, we are simultaneously able to see how the party is reacting to and dealing with the disappearance of that advantage. It’s like those villains in the movies who not only are dying, but who register on their face that they can’t comprehend they’re dying, that Hell has finally called their malevolent number, like Julia Roberts’s husband in Sleeping With The Enemy. God, it’s fun to watch. But it’s also a reminder of the danger of handing power to this man and the people he would bring in with him. Marx would be completely dead if we didn’t have the Republicans around to prove him right every so often. Yet here we are in 2012, able to say definitively that the moment of greatest apparent Republican foreign-policy triumph—spring and summer of 2003—contained, in good Marxian fashion, the seeds of its own destruction. That’s when neoconservatism and its grand theories seemed to be on the cusp of a great vindication. The Iraq effort became disastrous, but even into 2005, with the advent of the great uprising in Lebanon and the blessed end of the Syrian occupation, for which Bush deserved and received some credit, no honest liberal skeptic could be completely sure that Wolfowitz &amp; co. had everything wrong. But by January 2009, nearly everything was in tatters—Hamas was strengthened, Hezbollah was back in the saddle in Lebanon, Iran was emboldened, and more. The Freedom Agenda hadn’t made many people free. True, Iraqis no longer lived under a tyrant, and that’s no small thing. But we had to kill 100,000 of them and displace 2.2 million more to get the job done. That’s freedom for those who remain, I guess, but at a steep price. Across the rest of the region, the larger agenda, if anything, moved matters in reverse. Barack Obama hasn’t solved a lot of these problems, which predated him coming into office. But in Iraq and Afghanistan, he’s nudging the needle in the right direction. And he did more than nudge it, of course, when it came to bin Laden and Al Qaeda. Far from creating his own crisis as Bush did, Obama was hit with one, the Arab Spring. We can’t know how all that will turn out, and things certainly look bleak at this moment in Egypt and Libya. But Obama did the only things that could be done at the time. Can you imagine the United States siding with Hosni Mubarak against those people in Tahrir Square, or permitting the pre-advertised massacre of thousands in Benghazi? Mitt Romney Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Mitt Romney comments on the killing of U.S. embassy officials in Benghazi, Libya, while speaking in Jacksonville, Florida Sept. 12, 2012. (Charles Dharapak / AP Photo) The world is the world. Obama can’t wave a wand at it. But he can do what he has done, which is to run a sober and responsible foreign policy, not one based on theories developed in think-tank seminars underwritten by some hawkish Israeli billionaire. Obama’s approach to foreign policy is the one that has guided this country at its best moments (which have not, alas, been as frequent as we’d like), and it’s the foreign policy most Americans want. The neoconservatives, meanwhile, aghast at their defeat at the Obama’s hands, just contrive to get huffier and huffier. It was astonishing on Wednesday that even as few very elected Republicans dared venture where Romney went rhetorically, key neocon commentators like Bill Kristol defended Romney. They seem to believe, like a flailing orator, that if they just repeat a line more insistently and more loudly, the audience will respond. But the audience now has a body of facts, 12 years’ worth, to consider. In his four years, Obama has done a little more good—and a lot less harm. Obama has run a sober and responsible foreign policy, not one based on theories developed in think-tank seminars underwritten by some hawkish Israeli billionaire. That’s the past. As to the future, let’s begin by considering that 70 percent of Romney’s foreign-policy brain trust worked for Bush, as Ari Berman has reported in The Nation. Combining that dour factoid with the rumors and suggestions one sees planted in the press from time to time—that John Bolton would make a fine secretary of state—gives Americans much to fear in a Romney presidency. The only thing they’ve learned from the Bush failures and their years in opposition is the same lesson zealots always learn: that the only reason our ideas didn’t succeed is that they weren’t implemented purely enough. I trust that the prospect of those ideas being implemented more purely next time around startles you. Presidential candidate Mitt Romney held a press conference Wednesday to address the Libyan attack. If Obama is reelected—and Wednesday may prove to have been an important milestone toward that end—and if his next four years go roughly like the last four on the foreign policy front, the Democratic Party will be back to where it was on foreign policy dominance in 1948. I spent a lot of time in 2003 arguing with conservatives and even hawkish liberals—far more vociferously with the latter—that the neocon project did not represent a fulfillment of Truman/Acheson-style foreign policymaking. On Wednesday, Romney and his apologists went a long way toward proving me right.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347815056553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:04:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347815376352-11</Id><Topic><Title>Hmmm something isnt right here</Title><Username>brandish_mow</Username><Timestamp>1343334086000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 16:21:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>legofthebear, are you Brandish?</Msg><Username>maynardkrabs</Username><Timestamp>1347815376352</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:09:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347815549832-12</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC Board Misled by Goldman Sax</Title><Username>brandish_mow</Username><Timestamp>1343767770000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 16:49:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have a tendency to go along with this, check out the short interest curve from then to now.</Msg><Username>maynardkrabs</Username><Timestamp>1347815549832</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:12:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347815914874-13</Id><Topic><Title>All the funds and tutes that own this</Title><Username>brandish_mow</Username><Timestamp>1343335147000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 16:39:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think when the bank size ratchets down one more step, there will be a transaction.

If you knew more than what you listen to for propaganda you'd know that the US as a matter of policy spun down all targeting systems on ICBM's back in the 1990's. Currently NO US weapons of this type are in a "ready to go" status. Now from my satellite data we HAVE parked 4 B2B Stealth Bombers, 8 B52's with mixed ordnance including what MAY be SLAM's (latest variant), BLU-52's, the new bunker buster, and what appear to be three Death Stars at a classified base in the Indian Ocean with a mix or ordnance less likely to be used if the President decides that he's had enough of Iran's crap; between arming Shi'ite militias in Iraq to subsidizing terror in Israel to ignoring the IAEA while still attempting to cower under the protection of the NPT (unlike Israel which was never a signatory). THEN we can retarget cruise missiles on air defense assets and ready fields, and other SEAD targets (don't be so conceited as to believe we'd need to waste intercontinental missiles on a #$%$ ant target like Iran), and direct bombers to places that I could point to on a satellite map (spent a whole afternoon searching the Qum area for likely targets) for pre-selected targets likely to eat one of our new 30,000lb bunker busters. And, by the way, Ha'aretz isn't the most accurate rea on the Isareli street. Admitedly I read it also, as it tells me what the Arab apologists are saying as well as a mall amount of what the anti-Arab crowd is saying (or course that never changes, as you correctly pointed out), and I have noticed that even Ha'aretz has become more militant in its stand against Iran, a few self loathing Israeli's being the exception that proves the rule.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1347817476387</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 13:44:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347819193925-17</Id><Topic><Title>lunatic rightwingers pumping war</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347730043088</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:27:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I think the USA should not give any aid to israel until they return to the legal borders of 1967." Don't you mean the 1948 borders, the ones before repeated Arab attempt to slaughter the entire Jewish population of Israel, the ones that caused Israel to lose the West Bank to begin with (subsequently annexed by Jordon which then renamed itself Trans-Jordon)?? Or do you think the Arab nations should be able to keep Jewish territory conquered in war simply by the expedient of flooding it with non-Hashemite Arabs and calling them Palestinians? Shooting at "their own" people as they tried to cross the Jordon from the west so as to create a refugee problem in Israel instead of taking back the people you'd pushed in. But Israel of course has to give back ANY land previously held by Muslims (never mind that includes ALL the territory of Israel between the Diaspora and the Return), regardless of Arab status as Third Reich minor allies and losers in not only World War I, but World War II as well. Never mind that before the Return there were perhaps 10,000 people in what is now Israel, almost all of them concentrated in Quds ( Jerusalem as its been known for far longer, and by more people). It wasn't until Jewish settlers started coming to the Holy Land in the late 19th century that it was anything more than lifeless desert with occasional stands of Bedu caravans traveling back and forth along the old Silk Road paths they've traveled for centuries. People wonder why the arabs always say "Pre-67 borders". Why don't we instead go ALL the way back to the Balfour agreement, the first British division of the Mandate of Palestine set aside for a Jewish Homeland. I think it's original borders contain everything currently in Israel, all of what's now Jordon, and hunks of Syria and Iraq. The reason Israel isn't that size today is that Arab governments created by the SAME agreements after the breakup of the Ottoman empire #$%$ and moaned until the Zionists were convinced to settle for ever decreasing chunks of land until the end when they received a SMALL fraction of what was originally promised (or course it had to be admitted there were alot less Jews in 1947 than there were in 1918, thanks to attitudes like yours). If there's one thing you can get almost ALL Arab "civilians" to agree on its that they hate the Jews, and yes, Iran, Persians, or at least their leaders, WOULD be willing to lose half or more of its population if it could destroy Israel, and for very valid RELIGIOUS reasons. Of course the leaders will be buried deeply protected in a hidden location near Qum. As far as the Arabian area is concerned Dar Al-Islam still applies to Israel until they've shed enough blood trying to take it they admit that its the will of God that it exist. You'd think that after all the improbable victories Israel has had they'd at least have to admit the possibility that Allah doesn't WANT them to wipe out one of the other people's of the Book.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1347819193925</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 14:13:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347823555473-18</Id><Topic><Title>our friends in the Mid East?</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347715574137</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:26:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're right.

This was a vital and closely held Israeli secret.

Harman said that Israel was merely “resisting aggression,” but Rostow spat that the United States knew that Israel had lured Jordan into the war by means of fake reports of Egyptian victories. Harman was deeply troubled by the meeting and phoned Israel in the middle of the night. Tel Aviv then issued orders for its aircraft to sink the U.S. communications ship, the Liberty.

"Contrary to the impression conveyed by most news media coverage, the report provides new evidence that Iran’s enrichment strategy is aimed at enhancing its bargaining position in negotiations with the United States rather than amassing such a breakout capability," wrote Porter."</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347841301222</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 20:21:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347841390334-25</Id><Topic><Title>What is in your wallet</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1347743102099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:05:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have never blamed a president for oil prices. We do not have a nationalized oil indistry, they sell into a global market . What I do care about is weening us off of oil and republican policy has no desire AT ALL to make that happen. I care about the US being at the front of industry technologies, and republican policies do not care about that AT ALL. They have no vision at all. It is clear that the improvement in auto MPG is directly related to the GOVT setting future standards and the auto inductry meeting those standards.

It contains virtually every possible position. As it turns out, Romney's tried them all. But he's offering no apology for being unable to maintain any of them for very long. As a quick glance shows, the Romney guide to international relations may start with "Congress of the Elephant" and "Backwards Facing Neocon," but the contortions hardly end there. For example, Romney has said "this century's nightmare" is "violent, radical Islamic fundamentalism." But while in 2009 he wrote that Iran was the "biggest threat since Soviets," Mitt now claims that Russia is "our number one geopolitical foe." Al Qaeda? Not so much. In 2007, Governor Romney declared that "It's not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person," only to boast days later that Osama Bin Laden is "going to pay and he will die." Die Bin Laden did, but only because President Obama followed through on candidate Obama's promise that "if Pakistan cannot or will not act, we will take out high-level terrorist targets like bin Laden if we have them in our sights." Nevertheless, the 2012 edition of Mitt Romney that claimed "I think other presidents and other candidates, like myself, would do exactly the same thing" forgot about the Mitt of 2007, who said "I do not concur in the words of Barack Obama in a plan to enter an ally of ours." To be sure, Romney is all over the map on the war in Afghanistan. Contradicting the public statements of his own advisers, Mitt announced that "We should not negotiate with the Taliban. We should defeat the Taliban." He has both criticized and agreed with President Obama that "the timetable by the end of 2014 is the right timetable for us to be completely withdrawn from Afghanistan, other than a small footprint of support forces." Yet before that November statement Romney said last June," I also think we've learned that our troops shouldn't go off and try and fight a war of independence for another nation. Only the Afghanis can win Afghanistan's independence from the Taliban." It's no wonder he said nothing at all about Afghanistan at the Republican National Convention. For years, Governor Romney has taken a very hard line on Iran, invariably the same on drawn his friend and former business colleague Benjamin Netanyahu. That's why he forcefully campaigned for U.S. state pension funds to divest their holdings in companies doing business with Tehran. That effort lasted exactly one day, or as long as it took for the media to discover that Romney's former employer Bain &amp; Company was doing just that. As for launching military strikes against Iranian nuclear facilities, Republican nominee Romney said that "if I'm President," he won't "need to have a war powers approval or special authorization for military force." But while Mitt now says that "the president has that capacity now," during his first White House run he responded that first "you sit down with your attorneys." Contradicting both positions, Iran-Contra figure turned Romney adviser Elliott Abrams demanded President Obama go to Congress now for authorization of military force against Iran. If President Romney's advisers get their way, he's going to need it. In July, his aide Dan Senor (who as PR flack during the occupation of Iraq famously told a group of reporters a year into the war, "Off the record, Paris is burning. On the record, security and stability are returning to Iraq.") announced, "If Israel has to take action on its own, in order to stop Iran from developing that capability, the governor would respect that decision." But in an interview this week with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Romney contradicted that line, saying he has the same "red line" as President Obama: "Iran may not have a nuclear weapon." Of course, Mitt was in turn contradicted by his adviser Eliot Cohen, who claimed that Romney "would not be content with an Iran one screwdriver's turn away from a nuclear weapon." Of course, Mitt Romney had no such qualms about the war in Iraq. Not, that us, until he did. As he put it in 2008, "It was the right decision to go into Iraq. I supported it at the time; I support it now." But despite the lack of any new information over the following three years, Mitt had a change of heart. "Well, if we knew at the time of our entry into Iraq that there were no weapons of mass destruction -- if somehow we had been given that information, why, obviously we would not have gone in." Just days later, Romney changed course again: "The decision to go into Iraq was based upon the information that existed at that time and I supported that decision then and continue to, we now know a lot of things that we didn't know at that time but I don't want to suggest in any way that the decisions that were taken by congress and by the president based upon the information that we had was anything other than correct." Even before his embarrassing case of premature condemnation this week, Mitt Romney had awkwardly assumed several positions on Libya. On March 21, 2011, Romney announced, "I support military action in Libya. I support our troops there and the mission that they've been given." But a month later, Romney decided that President Obama was being too aggressive. But bending over backwards to woo hardline conservatives, Romney both slammed the President for "mission creep and mission muddle" and echoed John Bolton's statement that Obama was setting " himself up for "massive strategic failure" by demanding the ouster of the Libyan leader "while restricting military force to the limited objective of protecting civilians." By July, Romney asked, "Now the president is saying we have to remove Qaddafi. Who's going to own Libya if we get rid of the government there?" Yet when Qaddafi was killed, Romney changed course again, proclaiming, "It's about time." On other matters large and small, Mitt Romney has tied himself up in knots. Earlier this year, Romney was quick to denounce the Obama administration over its handling of Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng. But Romney's outrage turned to silence as the facts on the ground--and criticism from Bill Kristol that he was being "foolish"--emerged. And while he penned a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled "How I'll Deal with China's Rising Power," Romney was silent about the fact that Bain Capital, from whom he still earns millions annually, bought the video surveillance division of Chinese company that is a major supplier to the government in Beijing. Within the span of a few hours, Romney mocked and then praised London as host of the summer Olympics. And in 2007, Mitt Romney defended his sons' absence from the front lines in Iraq by proclaiming, "One of the ways my sons are showing support for our nation is helping me get elected because they think I'd be a great president." He later claimed he misspoke. (As for his own missionary position in France, Mitt said he both did and didn't regret not serving in Vietnam.) As it turns out, Mitt Romney has even changed positions on changing positions. After all, the Kama Sutra candidate claimed "I think you'll find that I've been as consistent as human beings can be" after having declared "if you're looking for someone who's never changed any positions on any policies, then I'm not your guy." That's one Mitt Romney position voters can get behind."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347849418989</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 22:36:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347849850803-30</Id><Title>An amazing resemblance</Title><Msg>by John Fugelsang Every time I see Mitt Romney I wonder how Satan got Ward Cleaver pregnant. 8:36 PM - 16 Sep 12</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347849850803</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-16 22:44:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
