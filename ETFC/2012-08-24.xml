Romney says he does not oppose contraception. Yet he has supported a state constitutional amendment, known as a personhood amendment, that defines life as beginning at conception. This is at odds with the medical community, which defines pregnancy as beginning with the implantation of a fertilized egg in a woman’s uterine lining, which occurs at least three days after conception. Such an amendment could outlaw any form of contraception that is believed by some to interfere with the implantation process, such as the birth control pill or some forms of intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Gov. Romney also refers to emergency contraceptives as “abortive pills,” even though they can only prevent pregnancy and will not work if a woman is already pregnant. And when he was governor of Massachusetts, he vetoed legislation that required hospitals to offer emergency contraception to rape victims and that made emergency contraceptives available over the counter without a prescription in his state. Finally, he has said that he disagrees with the Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which recognized the constitutional right to privacy and the right of married couples to use contraception. Instead, he questioned whether it should be a federal right, arguing that he would support returning the issue to the states. In other words, whether a woman has the right to obtain and use contraception would depend on where she lives. Gov. Romney would also make it harder for low-income women and women of color to access affordable birth control. He was the only Republican presidential primary candidate to propose completely eliminating the Title X national family planning program—because, according to him, it is not “essential” and because it benefits organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion care with nonfederal funds. However, this would cut off family planning services to over 5 million people each year, 20 percent of whom are black and 29 percent of whom are Latina. Many of Gov. Romney’s conservative colleagues have taken a hard line in their efforts to defund Planned Parenthood as part of their antiabortion strategy—and many have also voted to defund Title X, including his vice presidential pick, Rep. Paul Ryan—but few have openly advocated that the Title X program be completely eliminated. Moreover, when asked how he would cut the federal budget deficit, Gov. Romney’s response included that he would “get rid of ” Planned Parenthood. Leaving aside the demonstrably negligible effect this would have on overall government spending, the safety net provided by Planned Parenthood is essential for millions of women in this country who rely on the clinic’s services for cancer screenings, treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and prenatal care, in addition to affordable contraception. This would be particularly devastating to women of color, who face a host of reproductive health disparities including sexually transmitted infections, poor birth outcomes, maternal mortality, unintended pregnancy, abortion, and HIV/AIDS.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345783406000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 00:43:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345783474000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Talibornagain assault on women</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345778694000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 23:24:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Finally, Gov. Romney pledges to restore and strengthen the so-called Bush conscience rule, which would permit health care providers and entities to refuse to provide or cover health care services that they find morally objectionable. This rule was an expansive reading by the George W. Bush administration of legal provisions that only enabled health care workers and entities such as hospitals and health maintenance organizations to object to performing, counseling, referring for, or covering abortion. But President Bush broadly interpreted the law to apply to any health care service, including contraception, end-of-life care, HIV treatments, and many others, and extended it beyond doctors, nurses, and pharmacists to candy stripers, janitors, ambulance drivers, and health insurance claims officers, to name just a few examples. If elected, Gov. Romney would reinstate this overreaching regulation. Gov. Romney also supported the failed Blunt Amendment, which would have undermined an Obama administration regulation that requires health insurance plans to cover contraception with no cost-sharing, such as co-pays or deductibles. The amendment, named after Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), would allow employers and insurers to refuse to cover any health care service, including but not limited to contraception, that they find objectionable for moral or religious reasons. Romney would support efforts to outlaw abortion Gov. Romney has called Roe v. Wade, the case that established a constitutional right to abortion, “one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history.” As with contraception, he supports letting the states decide whether abortion should be legal. He also has said he “absolutely” would support a state constitutional amendment to define life as beginning at conception. And vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan has sponsored a similar federal measure in Congress. These would outlaw abortion under all circumstances with no exceptions. Such a law might also interfere with the treatment of ectopic pregnancies, with some fertility treatments, and with some methods of contraception, as described above.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345783474000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 00:44:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345785367000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Forecast</Title><Username>mathefnjs9460</Username><Timestamp>1345746842000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 14:34:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job guys</Msg><Username>fultonqquq41443</Username><Timestamp>1345785367000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 01:16:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345803930000-7</Id><Title>Obama Has Decimated The Middle Class</Title><Msg>In Obama's world there is the ruling class and 'everybody else'.

Kim Strong voter participation and engagement are fundamental to a healthy democracy. Efforts to restrict access to voting fly in the face of this important goal. Yet, despite another midterm election in November 2010 in which only 41 percent of eligible persons voted, numerous states are now facing renewed efforts to restrict, rather than expand, the franchise. Increasing numbers of states are considering strict voter identification laws that would disenfranchise thousands, and possibly millions of Americans. States considering voter ID proposals include North Carolina, Minnesota (bill to put constitutional amendment on 2012 ballot), Wisconsin, South Carolina, Kansas, Texas, and Mississippi (Republican leaders have collected enough signatures to put an ID measure on the ballot in 2011).</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345817364000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:09:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345817472000-13</Id><Topic><Title>Talibornagain Voter ID fraud</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345816961000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:02:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Key Points: • Voters expect the economic crisis to be the first order of business , not voter ID. Instead of focusing on creating jobs and saving homes, the real problems citizens confront, legislators are prioritizing a measure that will not solve any problem. • Voter ID laws costs millions of dollars to implement. Missouri estimates that a new voter ID would cost the state over $20 million to implement over the next three years. Legislators should confront the serious problems the state and its people face, instead of allocating funds to address a problem that does not even exist. • Voter ID requirements will add substantial new burdens on election administrators and poll workers. Introducing a voter ID requirement will require an extensive public education campaign, including mailings, advertising and public service announcements; require added poll worker training and potentially more poll workers; updating forms; updating websites; training on processing of provisional ballots; increased numbers of provisional ballots to print and process. • Numerous studies have found that the rare examples of voter fraud are almost never the kind that could be prevented by a photo identification law.2 Voter ID laws address one exceedingly rare form of voter fraud: impersonation of another registered voter at the polls. • Eleven percent of the population does not have the type of identification required by these laws.3 • Students are particularly harmed by photo ID requirements. Any student not attending a public university will be unable to use their student ID to vote. And many students are unlikely to have a driver’s license that reflects their campus address.4 • The elderly and persons with disabilities will be disenfranchised. Many older people no longer drive or maintain up-to-date driver’s licenses.5 Seniors will be unfairly blocked from voting because they lack this most common and acceptable form of voter ID. • African Americans, Latinos and new American citizens are far less likely to have identification. Such groups have been the historic targets of disfranchisement efforts in this country. Strict voter identification laws target them once again.6 • Just after a presidential election in which we saw historic turnout among young people, African Americans and Latinos, some legislators want to take those advances away. • Voter ID laws exacerbate low voter turnout, a major problem confronting our democracy. This is no time to enact measures that risk depressing the vote of seniors, students, people of color and other citizens.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345817472000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:11:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345817534000-14</Id><Topic><Title>Talibornagain Voter ID fraud</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345816961000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:02:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Data and Examples: Cost The voter ID programs being considered in the states are likely to cost taxpayers millions of dollars each year to implement. • States will need to offer free ID to new voters without acceptable identification, year after year. • Voter ID programs require added poll worker training for each new election. After all, these proposals essentially require that poll workers perform a quasi-law enforcement function -- checking the validity of individuals’ identification documents. • States will need to engage in ongoing, massive voter education campaigns to ensure voters know they must obtain and bring their required identification to the polls on election day. With the passage of Georgia’s ID law, the Secretary of State of Georgia had to send letters out to citizens suspected of not having the identification instructing them how to obtain ID, advertise in print and on-air media, and mail out information packets and reminders.7 At the same time, thirty-five states and Puerto Rico will struggle with budget shortfalls in fiscal year 2012. • The sum of these projected imbalances for the 31 states (and Puerto Rico) that provided an estimate stands at $82.1 billion. • Twenty-seven states and Puerto Rico project gaps in excess of 5 percent of their general fund budgets, with 21 of these anticipating gaps equal to or greater than 10 percent. • The largest shortfalls are expected in Nevada (32.0 percent), New Jersey (26.0 percent) and North Carolina (20.3 percent). Five states have projected gaps between 4.7 percent (Iowa) and 1.2 percent (Tennessee). • While budget gaps are expected in Illinois, South Carolina and South Dakota, official figures are unknown at this time.8 Disenfranchisement Many African Americans and low-income citizens do not have photo identification. • Eighteen percent of Americans over the age of 65 do not have a photo ID. • Fully a quarter of African-Americans and 15 percent of low-income voters don't have a photo ID.9 • One in five young voters don’t have a driver’s license, the most commonly accepted form of photo ID.

Only a very small handful of states require photo ID, but almost all of them have enacted policies that allow an eligible American voter to cast a regular ballot on election day, even if they fail to bring or do not have the ID required. Four states request all voters show photo ID, but those without the proper ID can simply sign affidavits – under penalty of perjury-- and cast regular (non-provisional) ballots.11 No ID is really “free.” • Even if the state offers one, the voter must still present other documents in order to get the “free” ID. The only truly acceptable documents are an original, stamped birth certificate or a passport. Many people will not have their original birth certificate at home. And only about a quarter of Americans have passports. Voters without their birth certificates handy will have to go out and buy one – in Indiana that costs between $12 and $20 and much more if the voter was not born in Indiana. In Texas, it costs $22. (In many states, a would-be voter must pay up to $45 for a birth certificate, $97 for a passport, and over $200 for naturalization papers.) • The process for getting a birth certificate itself requires voters to present identification. Many identifying documents cannot be issued immediately, so potential voters must allow for processing and shipping, which may take several weeks or even months. And additional difficulties develop if the surname on one’s birth certificate is different from that on other documentation, as commonly occurs with marriage. Women are disproportionately affected.12 Poll workers demand photo identification much more often from African Americans and Latinos than white voters. In a survey conducted by a Harvard professor of tens of thousands of voters in the 2006 general election, 47% of whites were asked for photo identification whether it was required or not, compared to 54% of Hispanics and 55% of African Americans. In this same study, a survey of thousands of voters in the 2008 Super Tuesday primary was also conducted and found that 53% of whites were asked for photo ID, compared with 58% of Hispanics and a staggering 73% of African Americans. This was true even after controlling for factors such as income, education, age and region.13 Public opinion polls showing support for voter ID laws are misleading. Most of those polled have ID themselves and are unaware of the burdens on voting such laws place on others. Public perceptions of voter fraud do not affect voter turnout. Research shows that beliefs about the existence of voter fraud have no impact on one’s likelihood of voting.14</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345817621000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:13:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345817664000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Talibornagain Voter ID fraud</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345816961000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:02:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The fundamental right to vote cannot be compromised by misinformed public opinion. Transient popular opinion created by misinformation disseminated through the right-wing echo chamber is no justification for needlessly violating the voting rights of American citizens. Absence of a Real Problem An intensive five-year investigation by President Bush's Department of Justice earlier this decade famously netted only 86 voter fraud convictions. Most of these were not for voter fraud that could have been prevented by a voter ID law.15 An extensive analysis by Professor Lori Minnite showed that at the federal level, only 24 people were convicted of or pleaded guilty to illegal voting between 2002 and 2005, an average of eight people a year. The available state-level evidence of voter fraud, which she culled from interviews, reviews of newspaper coverage and court proceedings, while not definitive, was also negligible. It included 19 people who were ineligible to vote, five because they were still under state supervision for felony convictions, and 14 who were not U.S. citizens; and five people who voted twice in the same election, once in Kansas and again in Missouri.16 Photo ID laws would have done little to address these few instances. Not one of the instances of voter impersonation cited by the proponents of Indiana’s voter ID law could have been prevented by pollsite photo ID. An analysis of the briefs submitted in support of voter ID in the Supreme Court case Crawford v. Marion County17 revealed that “not one of the citations offered by Indiana or its allies refers to a proven example of a single vote cast at the polls in someone else’s name that could be stopped by a pollsite photo ID rule.” The briefs examined included those submitted by the State of Indiana, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Attorney Generals of nine states, a national political party, members of Congress, various election officials, and several nonprofit organizations.18</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345817664000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:14:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345818453555-17</Id><Title>This correction looks done...</Title><Msg>but I could be wrong... tdc</Msg><Username>tradedotcom</Username><Timestamp>1345818453555</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:27:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345819001126-18</Id><Topic><Title>This correction looks done...</Title><Username>tradedotcom</Username><Timestamp>1345818453555</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:27:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wrong just remember etrade never fails to disappoint look for low 7</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1345819001126</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:36:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345819050547-19</Id><Topic><Title>Top 1% takes in more income than the entire bottom 50%</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345765393035</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 19:43:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if you dont like to live in a society under protection of a government umbrella that provides you the freedoms and opportunities that you have, then go buy your own island and live by yurself and dont pay any taxes.

Current seniors would also have to pay more for preventive, hospital, and physician services should Romney and Ryan repeal the Affordable Care Act, facing an increase in health spending of between $7,900 and $18,600 over the course of their retirement. Beginning in 2023, Romney’s proposal — which is modeled heavily on Paul Ryan’s FY 2013 budget — would provide all retirees with a premium support subsidy to buy coverage from an exchange of private insurance plans or traditional Medicare. Private insurance plans in each geographical area would bid for how much they would charge to provide Medicare benefits and the premium subsidy would be tied to the premium of the plan with the second-lowest cost, or the premium for traditional Medicare—whichever is lower. If seniors choose a plan that costs more than the voucher, they will have to pay the difference. As a result, most seniors will have to spend more on coverage. Here are 5 reasons why: 1) Current seniors will pay more. The premium support structure does not kick in until 2023, so current seniors will remain in the existing Medicare program. But should Romney/Ryan repeal the Affordable Care Act’s savings, beneficiaries will face higher cost sharing and premiums (particularly for preventive services) and seniors who have received prescription drug discounts, will now pay more for their medications. What’s more, Romney/Ryan would lower Medicaid spending significantly beginning next year, shifting federal spending to states and beneficiaries, and increasing costs for the 9 million Medicare recipients who are dependent on Medicaid.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345821935000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:25:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345822303000-31</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Has Decimated The Middle Class</Title><Username>youbabydaddy</Username><Timestamp>1345803930000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 06:25:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wrong!

Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs handed Obama a copy of the story in the Oval Office, just before he left for the Hill to make his case for the stimulus, an unprecedented visit to the opposition after just a week in office. “You know, we still thought this was on the level,” Gibbs says. Obama political aide David Axelrod says that after the president left, White House aides were buzzing about the insult. And they didn’t even know that Cantor had vowed to whip a unanimous vote—which, ultimately, he did. “It was stunning that we’d set this up and before hearing from the President, they’d say they were going to oppose this,” Axelrod says. “Our feeling was, we were dealing with a potential disaster of epic proportions that demanded cooperation. If anything was a signal of what the next two years would be like, it was that.” But that wasn’t the only signal. A few other examples: *Vice President Biden told me that during the transition, he was warned not to expect any bipartisan cooperation on major votes. “I spoke to seven different Republican senators who said: ‘Joe, I’m not going to be able to help you on anything,’” he recalled. His informants said McConnell had demanded unified resistance. “The way it was characterized to me was: ‘For the next two years, we can’t let you succeed in anything. That’s our ticket to coming back,’” Biden said. The vice president said he hasn’t even told Obama who his sources were, but Bob Bennett of Utah and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania both confirmed they had conversations with Biden along those lines.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345822890000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 11:41:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345824058000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Whats Wrong Now?</Title><Username>gombertejci69084</Username><Timestamp>1345819684000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 10:48:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cool picks.

Hopefully, the new regulators will allow the bank to pay a dividend to the parent for all of the excess capital at the bank (there is enough to pay off the springers). Patience will be rewarded.

At issue are two tax-avoidance techniques employed by Bain Capital, the firm founded by Romney, which have been commonly used in the private equity world but have come under increasing legal scrutiny. The first scheme involves owning U.S. dividend-paying stocks in an offshore account and pretending, for accounting purposes, not to own the stock. Instead, the taxpayer tells the Internal Revenue Service that he owns a derivative product that is identical in every way to the stock -- except it isn't the stock, so therefore no U.S. taxes are owed. It's called a "total return equity swap," because the buyer still gets the benefit -- the "total return" -- of owning the stock, or equity. "This use of total return equity swaps, such as to avoid the U.S. dividend withholding tax, was very widespread for more than a decade, and may not be dead yet, although the IRS issued a shot-across-the-bow Notice concerning the practice in 2010," writes Daniel Shaviro, the Wayne Perry Professor of Taxation at New York University School of Law. "But taxpayers who engaged in it to avoid the dividend withholding tax were coming perilously close to committing tax fraud, in cases where the economic equivalence to direct ownership was too great." The second technique is "not legal," according to Victor Fleischer, a tax expert and professor of law at the University of Colorado. A taxpayer saves substantial amounts of money by pretending that regular income received as a management fee for running a private equity firm is not income, but is instead a capital gain. That drops the tax rate on that income from 35 percent to 15 percent. Citing the Gawker documents, Fleischer notes that Bain engaged in the management-fee maneuver to reduce the tax bill of its investors. "Unlike carried interest, which is unseemly but perfectly legal, Bain’s management fee conversions are not legal. If challenged in court, Bain would lose. The Bain partners, in my opinion, misreported their income if they reported these converted fees as capital gain instead of ordinary income," he writes.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345830915000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 13:55:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345830962000-46</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot may be tax cheat!!!</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345830915000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 13:55:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shaviro, meanwhile, notes that Bain employed a version of the total return equity swap and says that taxpayers who engage in the practice have little legal justification for doing so. "[T]he only leg that taxpayers had to stand on in some of these cases was common practice and the apparent lack of IRS enforcement (not a very strong leg if the correct application of the law was clear)," he writes. "How far out on the limb were Bain-affiliated foreign entities that were making money through total return equity swaps, and claiming not to owe U.S. withholding tax? And what should we make of this, for purposes of the presidential campaign, if what they were doing, while legally dubious, was common practice?" "The unauthorized disclosure of a number of confidential fund financial statements is unfortunate," said Charlyn Lusk, a spokeswoman for Bain Capital. "Our fund financials are routinely prepared by auditors and demonstrate a commitment to transparency with our investors and regulators, and compliance with all laws." Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said that Romney is not responsible for whatever tax strategy employed. "As we have said many times before, Governor and Mrs. Romney's assets are managed on a blind basis. They do not control the investment of these assets, the investment decisions are made by a trustee," he said. But if Bain used improper tax-avoidance techniques, the Romneys would be required to amend their returns regardless of the blind nature of the investments. Private equity managers already get the vast majority of their income from capital gains, which are taxed a lower rate, but also take a fee -- typically 2 percent -- off the top. That management fee is income. But some private equity managers have claimed to "waive" that fee in exchange for future capital gains. "In exchange for a minimal amount of economic risk, the tax benefit is enormous: the compensation is transformed from ordinary income (taxed at 35%) into capital gain (taxed at 15%). Because the management fees for a large private equity fund can be ten or twenty million per year, the tax dodge can literally save millions in taxes every year," writes Fleischer. "The problem is that it is not legal."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345830962000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 13:56:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345830997000-47</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot may be tax cheat!!!</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345830915000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 13:55:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The IRS says the fee cannot be waived in exchange for capital gains if the income "relates to a substantially certain and predictable stream of income from partnership assets." In other words, Bain investors would need to convince a judge that their revenue stream was risky and not "substantially certain and predictable." Fleischer says he doesn't think the tactic would hold up in court. "Because the deals vary in their aggressiveness, there is some disagreement among practitioners about when it works and when it doesn’t," he writes. "But in my opinion, and the opinion of many tax practitioners, the practices that were common in the private equity industry in the 2000s became very, very questionable, and it’s unlikely that they would have stood up in court." But did Romney himself benefit from these maneuvers? And is Romney responsible for the legally dubious tax avoidance strategies Bain employed? Yes, Fleischer concludes: Yes, Romney left Bain in 1999 or 2002. But as part of his severance agreement, he continues to receive interests in these funds, which he has reported on his financial disclosures. In the usual case, a departing partner would receive an economic stake in the GP (Bain Capital Partners X, LP), rather than an economic stake in the LP (Bain Capital Fund X, LP) — representing a payment for the management services he provided in the past. Indeed, because he filed an 83(b) election, we can be sure that he received GP interests as part of his severance agreement, and that he therefore benefited personally from management fee conversions. [...] Romney here is not like a passive mutual fund investor. He helped engineer the funds in the first place. For at least some of the funds, the fee conversion was set in place at the time of the fund’s formation — in the case of Fund VII, when Romney was the sole shareholder of the management company that actually waived the fees (2000). It seems reasonable to infer that fee conversions were in place for earlier vintages of Bain Capital funds as well. I haven’t yet reviewed all of the Gawker documents, but we are talking hundreds of millions of dollars in tax liability on these funds — one hundred million in Fund IX alone (20% of the $500 million converted), another $70 million in fund X. It is unthinkable that in the 1990s through 2002, when Romney was putting together funds, that he was unaware of the fee conversion strategy, or that he was unaware that he continued to benefit from it today. UPDATE: 12:30 p.m. -- Rep. Sandy Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, questioned the fee conversion strategy in a statement. “[R]eports today indicating that Bain managers converted even their regular management fees into additional carried interest income that is taxed at capital gains rates is a particularly egregious example of how wealthy fund managers are able to avoid paying the same tax rates on their compensation as other Americans," he said. "This is a stark reminder of why Congress needs to act to close this loophole."

The place you want to start if you wanna see what kind of hit they will take trying to sell off the whole loan portfolio would be the fair value marks. They are currently 1.1 Billion. If you wanna be conservative up that by 50% so 1.6 Billion in additional write-downs if they wanted to sell. It aint gonna happen, at least not in the next year or until those fair value marks come way down. The marks actually increased this quarter compared to last, I emailed IR about this and they wouldn't really get into why they went up, even with 67 mil in provisions that should of decreased it. All I got out of them was that it didn't have anything to do with the 180 mil in HELOCs that got classified as non-accrual because the 1st lien was delinquent. Although I'm not sure I buy that as basically nothing has changed since the first quarter except for this, and the increase in marks is almost equal to the amount of those HELOC re-classifications.</Msg><Username>briguy260</Username><Timestamp>1345831432414</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 14:03:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345831555359-51</Id><Topic><Title>How much pop when we sell loan portfolio?</Title><Username>gar4one</Username><Timestamp>1345824278002</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 12:04:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, it is a short term vs long term dilemma.

In a wide-ranging interview with Time Magazine, Mitt Romney declined to say which deductions he would eliminate from the tax code in order to make his plan to cut tax rates across the board revenue-neutral. "I know our Democrat friends would love to have me specify one or two so they could amass the special interest to fight that effort," Romney told managing editor Richard Stengel when asked to specify which deductions he would eliminate. He then launched into a general discussion about ways to limit deductions, saying the choice would be made "in consultation with Congress" -- in other words, after the election. He added that he would maintain the mortgage-interest deduction, health care and charitable contribution deductions, the first two of which are the most expensive. All three deductions are popular. Romney has been specific about which deductions he would limit -- in private. In April, he told donors that he would probably eliminate the second-home mortgage interest deduction and limit state and local property tax deductions for high-income earners, according to NBC News. The problem is, those deductions don't come close to covering the costs of his tax plan. Eliminating those deductions might raise $40 billion a year over the $400 billion per year that the Romney plan would cost, according to The New York Times. A much-publicized study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed Romney's tax plan and concluded that if he wanted it to be revenue-neutral, he would have no choice than to limit the more popular and expensive deductions, therefore raising taxes on middle-class earners. Romney has dismissed that study, calling it "garbage." In the interview with Time, he maintained that he would not raise taxes on middle-class earners and said that cutting taxes would encourage economic growth, an idea the TPC dismissed, based on Congressional Budget Office estimates.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345836459000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 15:27:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345837520293-59</Id><Title>Added today more at $8.30!!</Title><Msg>Will close above $8.55!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1345837520293</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 15:45:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345837930782-60</Id><Topic><Title>Top 1% takes in more income than the entire bottom 50%</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345765393035</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 19:43:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Link please.

Along the way they have taken up the fight against women's rights and tried to turn the country back to pre-1920 mentality. This race toward fascism is somehow predicated on a peculiar and irrational interpretation of some form of Christianity, the Bible, Evangelical churches and the self-induced delusion that men are in control of women's bodies and their functions. I think otherwise. Here are some summaries of the absurd dance Republicans are doing in order to satisfy their base's desires. Earlier this year we all learned how the backward thinking legislature of Virginia and its highly ambitious Republican governor dealt with the law allowing abortions. Bob McDonnell and his compliant legislature floated a bill that would require a physician to perform an invasive procedure known as trans-vaginal insertion of an ultrasound probe into a woman’s reproductive system before the abortion could be performed. Every obstetrician and gynecologist not quacking said this procedure was absolutely not necessary. The “defense” for this requirement from the Republican delegation included statements that suggested that this penetration was as good as the next one that would produce the abortion and that most abortions are performed for lifestyle convenience. The media finally exposed these “keep-government-out-of-our-lives” hypocrites and the bill was shelved until 2013. Say, isn’t that AFTER the Presidential election? Then there were the “hearings” held by the California hatchet, Darrell Issa “discussing” the free contraception mandate in the Affordable Care Act. Not only did this theater of the absurd use the separation of church and state as its basis, the first panel of witnesses did not include a female. When Sharon Fluke was allowed to speak, her testimony was sordidly derided by the sewer Rush Limbaugh calls a mouth. The only thing worth mentioning from this exercise in political disgrace was the disgrace of the Republican brand. The latest media flap perpetrated by the nearly brain-dead Senatorial candidate from Missouri, Todd Akin, is the latest example of the callous and ignorant understanding of women, their rights and the law. I taught human anatomy for three years in college and medical school and was astounded to learn new things about the female reproductive system and its physiology from Mr. Akin.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345839352000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 16:15:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345839411000-65</Id><Topic><Title>Talibornagain assault on women</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345778694000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 23:24:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>. A little research turned up a 1996 report from the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology that noted there were over 32,000 pregnancies per year as a result of rape. It represented 5% of the victims raped between the ages of 12-45. This extrapolates to over 640,000 reported rapes. We are 16 years later with a more courageous female population that reports rapes more often rather than hides them. These simple data refute Akin’s assumptions about female reproduction systems and rape in particular. From what I read, the rate of violence against women is about the same today as in 1996, yet the GOP has recently voted against the Violence Against Women Act proposed by the Obama administration. They want to eliminate abortion altogether – as stated in their recently defined party platform – no matter the cause. They want to limit or eliminate contraception for women. From the lips of Romney himself: “We want to get rid of Planned Parenthood”. For those who don’t pay attention, Planned Parenthood provides free screenings for breast cancer, uterine cancer and other female reproductive issues NOT involving abortions. In fact the percent of Planned Parenthood work that is proactive for women is over 95%. Why, then, do Republicans want to end this program for women, especially poor women? Their theme seems to be: “You must have that baby, but once you do, you and it are on your own: No welfare, no food stamps, no Medicaid.” That sounds a lot like assault to me. The syndicated columnist Maureen Dowd says it best when addressing the assault on women and who leads that charge. She points out what the RNC is doing about it: “…by reiterating language in their platform calling for a no-exceptions Constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, even in cases of rape, incest and threat to the life of the mother. Paul Ryan, who teamed up with Akin in the House to sponsor harsh anti-abortion bills, may look young and hip and new generation, with his iPod full of heavy metal jams and his cute kids. But he’s just a fresh face on a Taliban creed — the evermore antediluvian, anti-women, anti-immigrant, anti-gay conservative core.” This assault on women is fueled by extremists from evangelical churches to mainstream Republican males of every stripe. There must be some inherent insecurity in these men that they feel so compelled to control women’s reproductive rights. Perhaps they should look into themselves for answers to their fears before emulating the attitudes of Saudi Arabia regarding women.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345839411000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 16:16:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345839448000-66</Id><Topic><Title>Talibornagain assault on women</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345778694000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 23:24:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Eliminating rape and violence against women is a good starting place for the debate. Rape is a violent act of power by males against the physically weaker female. If we accede to this barbarity, we are admitting we are barbarians. If we allow full-term pregnancies from rape and/or incest, we are admitting that these crimes against women are O.K. They are not. Any first year genetics student can explain why. I don’t like the concept of abortion; I prefer prevention of pregnancy. Our current laws allow some legally sanctioned abortions. Roe v. Wade was not approved by the Supreme Court on a whim or a message from God. It was made to allow women freedom over their bodies. Men don’t get pregnant nor give birth. They should not be involved with making laws that prevent women from expressing that personal freedom. A recent poll shows that Caucasian males in the U.S. favor Mitt Romney by about 29%. In view of the subject of this essay, I wonder what percentage of voting age females favor anything Republican. With the other GOP attacks and fear mongering against people not in their base, it follows that all women and those who are not in a “favored” group will be compelled to vote out and against those who are working against their best interests. The GOP is now the party of exclusion. My questions are: How could anyone with any respect for women and their hard-earned rights even consider voting for an agenda that condones rescinding those rights as well as rejecting a law intended to squelch violence against women? Do these people want to return to the pre-1920 era when women couldn’t vote? Well, too bad. Women DO have the right to vote, and if they have any self-respect and dignity they will vote against the Republican’s anti-woman agenda.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345839448000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 16:17:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345840749193-67</Id><Topic><Title>Top 1% takes in more income than the entire bottom 50%</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345765393035</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 19:43:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yahoo no longer allows links.
