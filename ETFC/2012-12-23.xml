As you progressives like to say "mission accomplished". Muslim Brotherhood claims victory in Egypt constitution vote amid fraud allegations Egypt's new Sharia-based constitution has been approved in a second round of voting, the ruling Muslim Brotherhood party said. The country's opposition leveled accusations of fraud, saying it will appeal the referendum results and form a new party. The new charter was approved by 64 percent of Egyptian voters in a “resounding victory,” state news agency al-Ahram reported on Sunday. The preliminary tallies were calculated from reports by polling station officials. Egypt's election committee will confirm the final results on Monday.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1356292933569</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 15:02:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356306056360-3</Id><Title>nice posts</Title><Msg>Merry Christmas billie!!!</Msg><Username>billietwinky</Username><Timestamp>1356306056360</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 18:40:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356311595519-4</Id><Title>Hey odumbomites</Title><Msg>What yer daddy get ye fer xmas....crunchy instead of creamy peanut butter....aged cheese....is that what the trillion buck in spending increase he wants is all about.........how bout them myans ...huh...ya smf'ers...hehehe</Msg><Username>jimmee_crackcorn</Username><Timestamp>1356311595519</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 20:13:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356314538049-5</Id><Title>Merry xmas odumbomites</Title><Msg>ya paranoid thieving parasitic llazy....bass terds.................may yer bowels get plugged by peanut butter and cheese and explode before the senate passes the bill as an epedemic disease to be covered by bammycare</Msg><Username>jimmee_crackcorn</Username><Timestamp>1356314538049</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 21:02:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356316014035-6</Id><Topic><Title>Heey pubbies!</Title><Username>slayer_696969</Username><Timestamp>1356312585169</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 20:29:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so did the gun go crazy?... what if it were a semi trailer that decided to take a detour through a crowded class room..would we ban them too because the truck went crazy....how bout a twin engine cessna...that ended up in a federal building..i guess the plane say #$%$...there's a federal building....i going to crash into it..........you aszzzzzzzzzsssaawipes are so shallow minded</Msg><Username>jimmee_crackcorn</Username><Timestamp>1356316014035</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 21:26:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
