With his baseless claims that waterboarding enabled the killing of Osama Bin Laden and that the Obama administration drafted a memo to protect the President from blame if the mission failed, former Attorney General Michael Mukasey has emerged as the new go-to fabulist for Team Bush. Now with his latest Wall Street Journal op-ed "Will Obama Free the Blind Sheik?" Mukasey has produced a devastating indictment. Devastating, that is, because in the absence of any confirmation that 1993 World Trade Center bombing mastermind Omar Abdel Rahman will be released, Mukasey argues "the evidence that the U.S. government is seriously considering transferring him to Egypt is circumstantial." But lost in Judge Mukasey's regurgitation of talking points from Fox Nation and crusading Islamophobe Rep. Peter King (R-NY) is an even more shocking question that remains unanswered: will Mitt Romney marry the Blind Sheik? The first clue about what may be a clandestine, decade-long relationship between the former Mormon bishop and the imprisoned Egyptian cleric first emerged five years ago. Despite his insistence that he would not appoint a Muslim-American to his cabinet, Governor Romney nevertheless used his 2007 "Faith in America" speech to praise "the commitment to frequent prayer of the Muslims." And where would Mitt Romney have heard those prayers? Could it have been during frequent visits to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Butner, N.C., where the diabetic Rahman is ensconced? Some have suggested that Romney could have traveled to see the Blind Sheik during any number of his scheduled trips to visit his money in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland. That would be consistent with rumors of a man with "shoulders as broad as a 747" using the name Rafalca Ibn Al-Tagg purported to frequent the Best Western Butner Creedmore Inn. And thus far, no one in the area can confirm not seeing him there. Other circumstantial evidence has emerged as well. At his Boca Raton fundraiser in May, Romney admitted that "we use Ann sparingly so people don't get tired of her." That could well be the frustration of a man prepared to divorce his wife of 43 years and then elope during a quiet, dignified getaway at a tony Provincetown bed and breakfast. Despite no indications thus far, there is no reason to believe Romney wouldn't once again make his son Tagg's basement his new home. And by tying the knot in the marriage equality state of Massachusetts, Mitt in a Sister Souljah moment could finally keep his 1994 promise to make "equality for gays and lesbians a mainstream concern." To date, the Romney campaign has been silent about the scuttlebutt surrounding Mitt and the terrorist cleric. Just as damning, no one has come forward to confirm that an affectionate and playful correspondence between the two hasn't been continuing for years. And until Mitt Romney mans up and states that he will never dump his devoted Ann for the ever-dangerous Omar, voters will have no other choice but to believe that he will.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348720862085</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 00:41:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348752972225-2</Id><Title>New York (Market Watch): Etrade Announces New Hire for CEO Role</Title><Msg>Sometime after market open this morning, Etrade will announce the hiring of a former Wells Fargo and Bank of America executive to fill the role of CEO. "This has been a long time coming" remarked Chairman Frank J. Petrelli. "We've needed a guy that isn't afraid to make a gutsy call". Speaking on term of anonimity, a member of Etrades board of directors indicated that the brokerage was intent on hiring Lance Easley. "That guy has guts. First to parlay a history degree into banking - that simply indicates the kind of balsyness that our corporate values strive for"..."then, to parlay a few high school referee gigs into a full blown NFL role, well, thats a 'ten' in my book!". "This hire is a touchdown in my book", remarked Ken. "Sure, Easley comes from a Bank of America, a failed bank, run by idiots and liars, but those are the building blocks of success on Wall Street... From here on out we are scoring nothing but touchdowns, and I can guarantee you that with the guidance and judgment of Easley, we will also be going for all the two point conversions." When asked if the role was too much for Easley, Ken responded, "hey, this guy has a degree in history, he worked for Bank of America, then he parlayed some worthless experience as a junior college basketball referee into an NFL gig. What more can you ask for! We just can't wait for him to get on board and start calling the shots. I will add further that we need a guy to take all of our failures, no matter how disgusting and dismal, and throw up his arms and make a positive call.. TOUCHDOWN!!!" Speaking on terms of anonymity, a Etrade board member commented that Easley will be paid $10,000,000 a year and get a $15,000,000 bonus when the company is sold in six months.</Msg><Username>brandish_now</Username><Timestamp>1348752972225</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:36:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348757248234-3</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot forgot he hates Romneycare</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1348714979738</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 23:02:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>kids...... the biggest moocher class of all.... and Romney gave them healthinsurance?</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1348757248234</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 10:47:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348757350997-4</Id><Title>Dicken's England was an " i built it" kind of place and they made poor kids work</Title><Msg>let the Scrooge Romney be free to create work houses, and debtor prisons and then the moochers will get back in line.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1348757350997</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 10:49:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348759875391-5</Id><Title>NEW DIPSHIDIOT TAPE UNEARTHED</Title><Msg>NEW ROMNEY VIDEO: In 1985, He Said Bain Would "Harvest" Companies for Profits This clip shows the young CEO focusing on businesses as targets for his investors, not as job creators or community stakeholders. —By David Corn | Thu Sep. 27, 2012 3:00 AM PDT Campaigning for the presidency, Mitt Romney has pointed to his stint as the founder and manager of Bain Capital, a private equity firm, as proof he can rev up the US economy and create jobs at a faster clip than President Barack Obama. Last year, while stumping in Florida, Romney declared, "You'd have a president who has spent his life in business—small business, big business—and who knows something about how jobs are created and how we compete around the world." His campaign spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, has said that Romney's Bain days afford him more expertise than Obama to "focus on job creation and turn around our nation's faltering economy." Romney has even claimed that during his tenure at Bain, "we were able to help create over 100,000 jobs." In his acceptance speech at the Republican convention, Romney smacked Obama for having "almost no experience working in a business" and tied that to the sluggish recovery. But at Bain, Romney's top priority wasn't to boost employment. As the Wall Street Journal recently noted, creating jobs "wasn't the aim of Bain or other private-equity firms, which measure success by returns produced for investors." And, the newspaper reported, Romney's 100,000-jobs claim is tough to evaluate. Mother Jones has obtained a video from 1985 in which Romney, describing Bain's formation, showed how he viewed the firm's mission. He explained that its goal was to identify potential and hidden value in companies, buy significant stakes in these businesses, and then "harvest them at a significant profit" within five to eight years. The video was included in a CD-ROM created in 1998 to mark the 25th anniversary of Bain &amp; Company, the consulting firm that gave birth to Bain Capital. Here is the full clip, as it appeared on that CD-ROM.....</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1348759875391</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 11:31:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348760807697-6</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot forgot he hates Romneycare</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1348714979738</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 23:02:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you know Romney - he was Pro ObamaCare before he was against it.... ...... like with pretty much every other political topic....

Todd Akin (R-MO) made his infamous observation that “legitimate rape” rarely produces pregnancy because “the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,” his fellow Republicans couldn’t run away fast enough. One after another they denounced Akin — despite the fact that many of them shared his sentiments on the issue if not his extremely poor choice of words. In fact, Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan even teamed up with Akin and other House Republicans in an ill-fated effort to redefine rape. Ryan also worked with Akin on a “personhood” measure that would outlaw abortion in all circumstances and ban common forms of birth control and in vitro fertilization. The most immediate impact of the Republican effort to distance themselves from Akin (and to try to force him to quit the race) came in the form of declarations from GOP outside spending groups that they would abandon Akin’s campaign and pull their money out of Missouri. For the most part, these groups have kept their word and Sen. Claire McCaskill has surged ahead in the polls. Now things have changed. Yesterday was the last day that Akin could pull out of the race and, as promised, he did not do so. So with their chances of taking the Senate looking more and more unlikely by the day, it appears Republicans don’t think Akin and his outrageously offensive comments are so bad after all. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the official campaign arm of Senate Republicans, opened the door to getting back into the race on Akin’s behalf: “There is no question that for Missourians who believe we need to stop the reckless Washington spending, rein-in the role of government in people’s lives, and finally focus on growing jobs in this country, that Todd Akin is a far more preferable candidate than liberal Sen. Claire McCaskill,” NRSC executive director Rob Jesmer said. “As with every Republican Senate candidate, we hope Todd Akin wins in November, and we will continue to monitor this race closely in the days ahead.” Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), who had earlier called on Akin to quit the race, also voiced his support for Akin: Congressman Akin and I don’t agree on everything, but he and I agree the Senate majority must change. From Governor Romney to the county courthouse, I’ll be working for the Republican ticket in Missouri, and that includes Todd Akin. Other prominent Republicans went even further. Former Republican presidential candidates Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum are backing Akin. Gingrich even held a fundraiser for Akin earlier this week. Akin also received the backing of Sen. Jim DeMint’s (R-SC) Senate Conservatives Fund, an influential, well-funded group that has backed the GOP’s most extreme Senate candidates over the past two election cycles. BOTTOM LINE: The GOP’s apparent re-embrace of Todd Akin tells us what we knew all along: Republicans didn’t really object to Akin’s comments about “legitimate rape,” they just found them to be politically inconvenient. Despite their initial attempt to distance themselves from Akin, it appears that Republicans are going to have to take responsibility for his outrageous comments about women and their bodies.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348770939799</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 14:35:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348771018404-20</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Fans Sure are Quiet !</Title><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1348714730835</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 22:58:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are you trying to out do yourself by repeating yourself three times, saying something dumb over and over again does not endure you.

In its annual revision to its employment data, the Labor Department said Thursday that 386,000 more jobs were created in the year ending in March than it originally had reported. The revision is a preliminary estimate, with a final figure coming in February. The revision "calls into question just how grave of a concern the labor market is" for the Federal Reserve, which announced a new round of stimulus this month, said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. "Maybe things are better than we think," he said, noting that the figures meant the economy added an average of more than 30,000 jobs each month during that period than initially thought.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348774155376</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 15:29:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348774432874-25</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Fans Sure are Quiet !</Title><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1348714730835</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 22:58:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor bidder has nothing positive to say about his candidate.

The Islamic Society of Greater Kansas City has launched a petition calling on Congress to “establish a law against insulting one’s religion.” “We understand the First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution is part of the Bill of Rights and, as such, prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, impeding the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, etc., but when the allowance of “free” speech incites violence it should be banned,” read a statement from the Islamic Society. While condemning the violence that was originally blamed on the film, the Muslim group said ti would “be in everyone’s interest to ban such actions from reoccurring.” “We condemn the violence and feel that, in spite of the First Amendment of the U. S. Constitution, action may be necessary to pass such a bill or, at least, censure such actions in order to calm the current situation as well as prevent future re-occurrences,” the statement read.

We all know these place names and what happened there. By the time this column appears, there may well be a new locale to add to the list. Such is the state of enabled and murderous mayhem in the United States. With the hope of presenting the issue of guns in America in a novel way, I'm going to look at it from an unusual vantage point: the eyes of a nurse. By that I mean looking at guns in America in terms of the suffering they cause, because to really understand the human cost of guns in the United States we need to focus on gun-related pain and death. Every day 80 Americans die from gunshots and an additional 120 are wounded, according to a 2006 article in The Journal of Policy Analysis and Management. Those 80 Americans left their homes in the morning and went to work, or to school, or to a movie, or for a walk in their own neighborhood, and never returned. Whether they were dead on arrival or died later on in the hospital, 80 people's normal day ended on a slab in the morgue, and there's nothing any of us can do to get those people back. In a way that few others do, I became aware early on that nurses deal with death on a daily basis. The first unretouched dead bodies I ever saw were the two cadavers we studied in anatomy lab. One man, one woman, both donated their bodies for dissection, and I learned amazing things from them: the sponginess of lung tissue, the surprising lightness of a human heart, the fabulous intricacy of veins, arteries, tendons and nerves that keep all of us moving and alive. I also learned something I thought I already knew: death is scary. I expected my focus in the lab to be on acquiring knowledge, and it was, but my feelings about these cadavers intruded also. I had nightmares. The sound of bones being sawed and snapped was excruciating the day our teaching assistant broke the ribs of one of them to extract a heart. Some days the smell was so overwhelming I wanted to run from the lab. Death is the only part of life that is really final, and I learned about the awesomeness of finality during my 12 weeks with those two very dead people. Of course, in hospitals, death and suffering are what nurses and doctors struggle against. Our job is to restore people to health and wholeness, or at the very least, to keep them alive. That's an obvious aim on the oncology floor where I work, but nowhere is the medical goal of maintaining life more immediately urgent than in trauma centers and intensive-care units. In those wards, patients often arrive teetering on the border between life and death, and the medical teams that receive them have fleeting moments in which to act. The focus on preserving life and alleviating suffering, so evident in the hospital, contrasts strikingly with its stubborn disregard when applied to lives ended by Americans lawfully armed as if going into combat. The deaths from guns are as disturbing, and as final, as the cadavers I studied in anatomy lab, but the talk we hear from the gun lobby is about freedom and rights, not life and death. Gun advocates say that guns don't kill people, people kill people. The truth, though, is that people with guns kill people, often very efficiently, as we saw so clearly and so often this summer. And while there can be no argument that the right to bear arms is written into the Constitution, we cannot keep pretending that this right is somehow without limit, even as we place reasonable limits on arguably more valuable rights like the freedom of speech and due process. No one argues that it should be legal to shout "fire" in a crowded theater; we accept this limit on our right to speak freely because of its obvious real-world consequences. Likewise, we need to stop talking about gun rights in America as if they have no wrenching real-world effects when every day 80 Americans, their friends, families and loved ones, learn they obviously and tragically do. Many victims never stand a chance against a dangerously armed assailant, and there's scant evidence that being armed themselves would help. Those bodies skip the hospital and go straight to the morgue. The lucky ones, the survivors - the 120 wounded per day - get hustled to trauma centers and then intensive care units to, if possible, be healed. Many of them never fully recover. A trauma nurse I know told me she always looked at people's shoes when they lay on gurneys in the emergency department. It struck her that life had still been normal when that patient put them on in the morning. Whether they laced up Nikes, pulled on snow boots or slid feet into stiletto heels, the shoes became a relic of the ordinariness of the patient's life, before it turned savage. So I have a request for proponents of unlimited access to guns. Spend some time in a trauma center and see the victims of gun violence - the lucky survivors - as they come in bloody and terrified. Understand that our country's blind embrace of gun rights made this violent tableau possible, and that it's playing out each day in hospitals and morgues all over the country. Before leaving, make sure to look at the patients' shoes. Remember that at the start of the day, before being attacked by a person with a gun, that patient lying on a stretcher writhing helplessly in pain was still whole.

However, the crime rates, and the armed crime rates, in these states is substantially above those in states that have the least restrictive gun laws. Why? Because law abiding citizens, like me, actually abide by our laws, including gun control laws, despite how much we disagree with them. Criminals, or those with criminal intent, ignore gun control laws. As you've noted, the right to bear arms is clearly and concisely written into our Constitution. If you don't like it, you have one of two choices. Either try to repeal the Second Amendment (good luck with that); or emigrate to another country with very strict gun control laws -- like Mexico. I am sure that you will feel more safe there. -GK</Msg><Username>gorakrishna</Username><Timestamp>1348793692360</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 20:54:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348794003910-37</Id><Topic><Title>Response to the gun lobby</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1348784975693</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 18:29:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By the way, according to the CDC, more than 440,000 people die each year in the U.S. to smoking-attributable illnesses, and 43,000 people die each year in the U.S. in automobile accidents.

And the U.S. has the highest firearm homicide rates in the developed world. Despite these numbers and the recent spate of deadly gun violence incidents, it’s not likely we’ll hear much about gun control from our presidential and congressional candidates. The popular position of most politicians falls somewhere between claiming that current gun laws are adequate and just need to be enforced, to deferring the responsibility to individual states. As a result we have inconsistent and insufficient gun laws. In 33 states, criminals and terrorists can buy military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips from “private dealers” on the Internet or at gun shows without showing ID or completing a background check. No ID, no background check, no restrictions, no detection. It is perfectly legal for private gun dealers and individuals to sell an unlimited number of firearms to anyone, including domestic criminals and international terrorists, cash and carry. In addition to neglecting public safety and contributing to the 30,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S. each year, current gun laws fly in the face of public opinion. Most citizens, members of law enforcement, gun owners and even a majority of NRA members agree that we need more restrictive laws governing the buying and selling of firearms. Consider these figures from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence: 94 percent of police chiefs favor requiring a criminal background check for all handgun sales 87 percent of Americans support background checks on private sales of guns, including sales at gun shows 83 percent of gun owners support background checks on private sales of guns, including sales at gun shows 69 percent of gun owners who belong to the NRA support requiring all gun sellers at gun shows to conduct criminal background checks of the people buying guns There are several examples of successful legislative efforts to reduce gun violence, and real results that show the connection between restricted access to guns and reduced gun violence. Between 1994 and 2004, under a federal assault weapons ban, there was a 66 percent reduction in assault weapons linked to crimes. (Assault weapons are the common denominator in every mass shooting because they can fire up to 100 rounds before reloading.) Since the ban expired, we have seen these military-style assault weapons come back into circulation. Previously banned guns like the AR-15, used in the Aurora massacre, are readily available to criminals and terrorists in the 33 states with lax gun control laws and at thousands of gun shows. In Massachusetts, where we have some of the most effective gun laws, firearms kill three people per 100,000 each year, compared to the national average of 10 per 100,000. Despite being an urban industrial state, Massachusetts boasts the lowest firearm fatality rate in the nation. More Americans have been killed by guns in the past 40 years than all U.S. service men and women killed in all foreign wars combined. Massachusetts is one of the few states to require gun training, licensing and registration, and consumer protection standards for firearm manufacturers, and is one of only 17 states that require criminal background checks for all gun sales. These tough gun laws strengthen the conclusion reached by the Violence Policy Center, which found that states with the lowest firearm fatality rates have more restrictive gun laws and lower gun ownership rates. Even for those inclined to dispute the connection between easy gun access and high rates of gun violence, there is still no basis for claiming that we should make guns easier for criminals and terrorists to access without detection. So why do we still have federal policies that are intended to increase access to guns by criminals? How can we not see the problem with allowing criminals and terrorists to legally buy guns without detection? Unfortunately the answer is simple: Sadly, Congress is willing to ignore the need for effective gun violence prevention laws in exchange for tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions from the gun industry and the NRA. What is it going to take for us to recognize the deadly reality of the situation and hold our elected officials accountable? Current national gun laws that allow unrestricted and undetected gun access have resulted in more Americans being killed by guns in the past 40 years than all U.S. service men and women killed in all foreign wars combined. Look at the facts and let your policymakers know that you’re paying attention to their unconscionable and dangerous gun policies."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1348796129335</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 21:35:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348797652481-39</Id><Title>You are nuts to respond to the libturd</Title><Msg>jbmaria/shineola/hohobo has been so desperate to bait someone into keeping it company here.

There's substantial evidence that Romney may have broken the law by lying to the American people about when he left Bain Capital on an official candidate disclosure form. That's why today, as reported in The Boston Globe, MoveOn is delivering a formal legal memo to the Department of Justice, along with a request for them to investigate.1 Because if Romney did break the law, his entire candidacy could be called into question. This calls for a federal investigation. With absentee ballots out and early voting already underway, it's important that every American knows the truth as soon as possible—so we need to make sure that the Department of Justice gets to the bottom of this. And that will take a big public push. Can you call the Department of Justice? Tell them: "There is substantial evidence that Mitt Romney committed a crime when he lied to the American people about his involvement with Bain. Please investigate." Department of Justice (202) 353-1555 Then click here to report your call. On August 12, 2011, Romney filed his Public Financial Disclosure Report as presidential candidates are required to do by law. This requirement exists so that the American people know some basic, important truths about the people asking for their vote. Romney's report states that: Since February 11, 1999, Mr. Romney has not had any active role with any Bain Capital entity and has not been involved in the operations of any Bain Capital entity in any way.2 But public filings confirm that Romney continued, after February 1999, to hold key responsibilities with Bain Capital. That means Romney may have knowingly lied in his public disclosures.3 If that proved to be the case, Romney could be charged with violating the False Statements Act—a serious crime for anyone, but especially for a presidential candidate.4 And we're doing what no one else has—providing a formal legal analysis and delivering it to the authorities. Now we need a strong public demand for an investigation to make it happen. Here's where to call: Department of Justice (202) 353-1555 Then click here to report your call.

The court denied Van Hollen's request to bypass the Court of Appeals and have the Supreme Court take up the case first. "I am very disappointed that the Supreme Court has failed to act by denying the motions to consolidate these actions, bypass the Court of Appeals, and stay the injunctions against the Voter ID law. ... Despite this setback, I continue to believe that the Voter ID law is constitutional and I will continue the battle to have the law upheld," Van Hollen said in a statement.
