Once housing shows that it is again on the rise and has a floor under it, the economy rebounds and hiring starts again this Co will be a hard target to take over with increasing revinues as trading comes back and as we have seen in Jan Numbers Investors are coming back in droves and so is their $$.

Millions Improperly Claimed U.S. Phone Subsidies . The U.S. government spent about $2.2 billion last year to provide phones to low-income Americans, but a Wall Street Journal review of the program shows that a large number of those who received the phones haven't proved they are eligible to receive them. WSJ's Spencer Ante has details of a $2.2 billion government program to give cell phones to poor people that resulted in phones winding up in the hands of people ineligible for the program. The Lifeline program begun in 1984 to ensure that poor people aren't cut off from jobs, families and emergency services is funded by charges that appear on the monthly bills of every landline and wireless-phone customer. Payouts under the program have shot up from $819 million in 2008, as more wireless carriers have persuaded regulators to let them offer the service</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360700788037</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 15:26:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360701523473-16</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo 'Gerbiled' by Commie Moosleem past (Al Gore-zeer news)</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1360695794549</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:03:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo-crats have a pretty hard time with history.

Just like the so called "war on poverty", how is that working out after trillions spent? 65.4 Million Gun Purchases Since Obama Took Office, 91% More Than Bush's First-Term Total There have been 65,376,373 background checks completed for Americans purchasing firearms since February of 2009, the first full month of Barack Obama's presidency. According to data compiled by the FBI, the number of Americans purchasing guns has skyrocketed since Obama was elected. In 2009, there were 13,984,953 background checks for Americans buying firearms. If we subtract the 1,212,860 checks completed in the month of January, the total checks for the year under Obama were 12,772,090. For 2010, background checks totaled 14,320,489. In 2011, checks were 16,336,732, and in 2012, 19,463,832. Background checks for the month of January 2013 were 2,483,230. This totals 65,376,373 background checks completed since President Obama's first full month in office, or 44,748 background checks per day! By comparison, the number of background checks in Obama's first term is 91.1% higher than President George W.
