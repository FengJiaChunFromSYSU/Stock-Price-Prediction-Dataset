At a Thursday hearing in the Senate, Republican Ted Cruz asked both Leon Panetta and Martin Dempsey, "In between 9:42 p.m., Benghazi time, when the first attacks started, and 5:15 am, when Mr. Doherty and Mr. Woods lost their lives, what converations did either of you have with the Presdient or Secretary Clinton?" "We could not find them," Panetta responded.</Msg><Username>mark355tysnn</Username><Timestamp>1360264218266</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 14:10:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360264585149-4</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$- IN DEPTH ETFC Analyst Report #$%$-</Title><Username>paulward735</Username><Timestamp>1360008343521</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 15:05:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>helpful report.</Msg><Username>diegofisher522</Username><Timestamp>1360264585149</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 14:16:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360265613119-5</Id><Topic><Title>"strengthen and save" "strengthen and save" "strengthen and save"</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1360263834740</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 14:03:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why cut anything?

Six world powers – including the US – are due to resume nuclear talks with Iran on Feb. 26 in Kazakhstan, after an eight-month hiatus. Few expect a breakthrough, not least because Iran is preparing for elections in June. But the words of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who has the final say on all strategic decisions in Iran, as official holder there of the title "God's deputy on earth" appear to have scuppered chances of an immediate direct dialogue with the US. "You Americans are pointing the gun at Iran and say either negotiate or we will shoot. The Iranian nation will not be frightened by the threats,"Ayatollah Khamenei told Air Force commanders in a speech today. "Some naive people like the idea of negotiating with America, but negotiations will not solve the problems," Khamenei said in the remarks, which were posted on his website. "If some people want American rule to be established again in Iran, the nation will rise up to face them."</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360268549819</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 15:22:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360269478571-9</Id><Topic><Title>-= =- Major ETFC Pre Promotion Report (LEAKED!!!!) -= =-</Title><Username>fosterjoseph487</Username><Timestamp>1359407914135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 16:18:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks, good report</Msg><Username>ivorycampbell321</Username><Timestamp>1360269478571</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 15:37:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360272519124-10</Id><Topic><Title>Once again Biden becomes the default buffoon</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360268549819</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 15:22:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are in denial, blinded by your ideology.

Neville Chamberlain "Peace for Our Time," September 30, 1938 We, the German Fuhrer and Chancellor, and the British Prime Minister, have had a further meeting today and are agreed in recognizing that the question of Anglo-German relations is of the first importance for our two countries and for Europe. We regard the agreement signed last night and the Anglo-German Naval Agreement as symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again. We are resolved that the method of consultation shall be the method adopted to deal with any other questions that may concern our two countries, and we are determined to continue our efforts to remove possible sources of difference, and thus to contribute to assure the peace of Europe. My good friends, for the second time in our history, a British Prime Minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honor. I believe it is "peace for our time." Go home and get a nice quiet sleep.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360281916764</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 19:05:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360282018552-16</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC lays off 200 people in last 90 days</Title><Username>vetfrc</Username><Timestamp>1360280043711</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 18:34:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To bad they didn't cut that brat from the commercials.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360282018552</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 19:06:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360283564195-17</Id><Topic><Title>righty hero ayn rand had to use social security</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1360278115595</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 18:01:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Schmuck, "...the victims, who opposed such laws, have a clear right to any refund of their own money—and they would not advance the cause of freedom if they left their money unclaimed, for the benefit of the welfare-state administration." - Ayn Rand.
