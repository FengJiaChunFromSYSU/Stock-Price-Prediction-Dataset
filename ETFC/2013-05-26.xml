No, wait, that's why I'm rushing building my house on my rural acres, because I have found NO advantage to being so close to the VA, in fact my years under Dallas VA care have been the worst, from a medical standpoint, in my life. If I could flick a switch, empty the facility, and put a W-79 from a 155mm M110 artillery piece in the breadbasket just to draw attention to how pathetic it WAS, I would. Of course it COULD be all the affirmative action and sponsored education hires the VA in Dallas has, but I don't think that's it either because the hardware sits around gleaming while there is almost NO staff at times. Affirmative action, sponsored education, or otherwise. And for "good coverage" by VA standards? Theoretically they cover EVERYTHING for me as I'm 100% Priority 1 . . . but that requires them to actually call your BACK and create your appointment. That hasn't happened. So, my MS is flaring up, I have no operable safe wheelchair, im losing muscle mass and energy while they wait for it to be ordered or delivered (I don't even know if the expenditure has been approved despite them theoretically having no option) and I may or may NOT get updates before either the chair is delivered to the VA and they call me, or, like the other chair (the backup for the broken one) they were supposed to get me, I wait 3 years and hear nothing from them. You see, government systems aren't publicly accountable. Our local television network stations have done bits on how horrible the Dallas VA is, but yet, nothing changes. That's because to change something at a single point of delivery medical system is almost impossible once a bureaucrat has established an empire.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369575286881</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 09:34:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369576352726-8</Id><Topic><Title>PricewaterhouseCoopers: Obamacare will save businesses &amp; employees money</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369315831071</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 09:30:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, more the fact that it hit the top, and that what followed was, well, disturbing otherwise.

Consider this our Top 6 list of need-to-know facts on social welfare nonprofits, also known as dark money groups because they don’t have to disclose their donors. The groups poured more than $256 million into the 2012 federal elections. 1. Social welfare nonprofits are supposed to have social welfare, and not politics, as their “primary” purpose.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578117535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:21:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369578175691-11</Id><Topic><Title>Six Facts Lost in the IRS Scandal</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578117535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A century ago, Congress created a tax exemption for social welfare nonprofits. The statute defining the groups says they are supposed to be “operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare.” But in 1959, the regulators interpreted the “exclusively” part of the statute to mean groups had to be “primarily” engaged in enhancing social welfare. This later opened the door to political spending. So what does “primarily” mean? It’s not clear. The IRS has said it uses a “facts and circumstances” test to say whether a group mostly works to benefit the community or not. In short: If a group walks and talks like a social welfare nonprofit, then it’s a social welfare nonprofit. This deliberate vagueness has led some groups to say that “primarily” simply means they must spend 51 percent of their money on a social welfare idea — say, on something as vague as “education,” which could also include issue ads criticizing certain politicians. And then, the reasoning goes, a group can spend as much as 49 percent of its expenditures on ads directly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for office. Nowhere in tax regulations or rulings does it mention 49 percent, though. Some nonprofit lawyers have argued that the IRS should set hard limits for social welfare nonprofits — setting out, for instance, that they cannot spend more than 20 percent of their money on election ads or even limiting spending to a fixed amount, like no more than $250,000. So far, the IRS has avoided clarifying any limits.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578175691</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:22:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369578284172-12</Id><Topic><Title>Six Facts Lost in the IRS Scandal</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578117535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2. Donors to social welfare nonprofits are anonymous for a reason. Unlike donors who give directly to politicians or even to super PACs, donors who give to social welfare nonprofits can stay secret. In large part, this is because of an attempt by Alabama to force the NAACP, then a social welfare nonprofit, to disclose its donors in the 1950s. In 1958, the Supreme Court sided with the NAACP, saying that public identification of its members made them at risk of reprisal and threats. The ACLU, which is itself a social welfare nonprofit, has long made similar arguments. So has Karl Rove, the GOP strategist and brains behind Crossroads GPS, which has spent more money on elections than any other social welfare nonprofit. In early April 2012, Rove invoked the NAACP in defending his organization against attempts to reveal donors. The Federal Election Commission could in theory push for some disclosure from social welfare nonprofits — for their election ads, at least. But the FEC has been paralyzed by a 3-3 partisan split, and its interpretations of older court decisions have given nonprofits wiggle room to avoid saying who donated money, as long as a donation wasn’t specifically made for a political ad. New rulings indicate that higher courts, including the Supreme Court, favor disclosure for political ads, and states are also stepping into the fray. During the 2012 elections, courts in two states – Montana and Idaho – ruled that two nonprofits engaged in state campaigns needed to disclose donors. But sometimes, when nonprofits funnel donations, the answers raise more questions. It’s the Russian nesting doll phenomenon. Last election, for instance, California’s election agency pushed for an Arizona social welfare nonprofit to disclose donors for $11 million spent on two California ballot initiatives. The answer? Another social welfare nonprofit, which in turn got the money from a trade association, which also doesn’t have to reveal its donors.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578284172</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:24:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369578365098-13</Id><Topic><Title>Six Facts Lost in the IRS Scandal</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578117535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>3. The Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision meant that corporations could pay for political ads, anonymously, using social welfare nonprofits. In January 2010, the Supreme Court ruled that corporations and unions could spend money directly on election ads. A later court decision made possible super PACs, the political committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money from donors, as long as they don’t coordinate with candidates and as long as they report their donors and spending. Initially, campaign finance watchdogs believed corporations would give directly to super PACs. And in some cases, that happened. But not as much as anyone thought, and maybe for a reason: Disclosure isn’t necessarily good for business. Target famously faced a consumer and shareholder backlash after it gave money in 2010 to a group backing a Minnesota candidate who opposed gay rights. Many watchdogs now believe that large public corporations are giving money to support candidates through social welfare nonprofits and trade associations, partly to avoid disclosure. Although the tax-exempt groups were allowed to spend money on election ads before Citizens United, their spending skyrocketed in 2010 and again in 2012.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578365098</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:26:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369578409402-14</Id><Topic><Title>Six Facts Lost in the IRS Scandal</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578117535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A New York Times article based on rare cases in which donors have been disclosed, sometimes accidentally, explored the issue of corporations giving to these groups last year. Insurance giant Aetna, for example, accidentally revealed it gave $3 million in 2011 to the American Action Network, a social welfare group founded by former Sen. Norm Coleman, a Republican, that runs election ads. Groups that favor more disclosure have so far failed to force action by the FEC, the IRS, or Congress, although some corporations have voluntarily reported their political spending. Advocates have now turned to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is studying a proposal to require public companies to disclose political contributions. The idea is already facing strong opposition from House Republicans.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578409402</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:26:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369578524999-15</Id><Topic><Title>Six Facts Lost in the IRS Scandal</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578117535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4. Social welfare nonprofits do not actually have to apply to the IRS for recognition as tax-exempt organizations. With all the furor over applications being flagged from conservative groups — particularly groups with “Tea Party,” “Patriot” or “9/12″ in their names — it’s worth remembering that a social welfare nonprofit doesn’t even have to apply to the IRS in the first place. Unlike charities, which are supposed to apply for recognition, social welfare nonprofits can simply incorporate and start raising and spending money, without ever applying to the IRS. The agency’s nonprofit wing is mainly concerned about ferreting out bad charities, which are the biggest chunk of nonprofits and the biggest source of potential revenue. After all, the IRS’s main job is to collect revenue. Charities allow donors to deduct donations, while social welfare nonprofits don’t. Most major social welfare nonprofits do apply, because being recognized is seen as insurance against later determination by the IRS that the group should have registered as a political committee and may face back taxes and disclosure of donors. A recognition letter is also essential to raise money from certain donors — like, say, corporations. But some of the new groups haven’t applied. The first time the IRS hears about these social welfare nonprofits is often when they file their first annual tax return, not due until sometimes more than a year after they’ve formed. In many cases, the first time the IRS hears about these groups is a full year after an election.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578524999</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:28:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369578689362-16</Id><Topic><Title>Six Facts Lost in the IRS Scandal</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578117535</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>6. Some social welfare groups promised in their applications, under penalty of perjury, that they wouldn’t get involved in elections. Then they did just that. Much of the attention when it comes to Tea Party nonprofits has focused on their applications and how the IRS determines whether a group qualifies for social welfare status. As part of our reporting on dark money in 2012, ProPublica looked at more than 100 applications for IRS recognition. One thing we noted again and again: Groups sometimes tell the IRS that they are not going to spend money on elections, receive IRS recognition, and then turn around and spend money on elections The application to be recognized as a social welfare nonprofit, known as a 1024 Form, explicitly asks a group whether it has spent or plans to spend “any money attempting to influence the selection, nomination, election, or appointment of any person to any Federal, state, or local public office or to an office in a political organization.” The American Future Fund, a conservative nonprofit that would go on to spend millions of dollars on campaign ads, checked “No”in answer to that question in 2008. The very same day the group submitted its application, it uploaded this ad to its YouTube account: Even before mailing its application to the IRS saying it would not spend money on elections in 2010, the Alliance for America’s Future was running TV ads supporting Republican candidates for governor in Nevada and Florida. It also had given $133,000 to two political committees directed by Mary Cheney, the daughter of the former vice president. Another example of this is the Government Integrity Fund, a conservative nonprofit that ran ads in last year’s U.S. Senate race in Ohio. Its application was approved after it told the IRS that it would not spend money on politics. The group went on to do just that.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369578689362</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:31:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369579378798-17</Id><Topic><Title>Is This the Perverted Republican Fantasy Board ?</Title><Username>anotherwingnutloser</Username><Timestamp>1369531464638</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 21:24:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Note; slayer, bidder, rodent, etc., haver never denied their affiliation with Log Cabin GOP.</Msg><Username>lonelygaybillie</Username><Timestamp>1369579378798</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 10:42:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369580966497-18</Id><Title>Obama Visits Tornado Town</Title><Msg>Bush would just fly over on his way to clearing brush and golfing at his ranch.</Msg><Username>mittins_da_wimpins</Username><Timestamp>1369580966497</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 11:09:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369583096449-19</Id><Title>OMG- Obamcare is a TRIUMPH!!!!</Title><Msg>“One reason for the misplaced expectations may be that actuaries have been making worst-case assumptions, even as insurers—eyeing the prospects of so many new customers—have been calculating that it’s worth bidding low in order to gobble up market share. This would help explain why premium bids in several other states have proven similarly reasonable. “The premiums and participation in California, Oregon, Washington and other states show that insurers want to compete for the new enrollees in this market,” Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said via e-mail. “The premiums have not skyrocketed and the insurers that serve this market now are continuing. The rates look like what we would expect for decent coverage offered to a standard population.” Cohn is saying that, despite the political naysayers, the healthcare exchange concept appears to be working very well indeed in states like California, Oregon and Washington—the first states to publish the expected health exchange prices for purchasing coverage. These are also states that are actually committed to seeing the program work as opposed to those states whose leaders have a vested political interest in seeing the Affordable Care Act fail. Keep in mind that the entire idea of the exchanges is to require health insurance companies to compete openly with one another by offering identical coverage programs in the three created classes—each offering insurance coverage that actually delivers meaningful protection to customers—and then openly disclosing the price each insurance company will charge for that policy. Thus, shoppers can clearly see which company has the best price on an apples-to-apples basis."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369583096449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 11:44:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369583437814-20</Id><Topic><Title>OMG- Obamcare is a TRIUMPH!!!!</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369583096449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 11:44:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Sarah Kliff at The Washington Post reveals just far off the prognosticators have been. “The Congressional Budget Office predicted back in November 2009 that a medium-cost plan on the health exchange – known as a “silver plan” – would have an annual premium of $5,200. A separate report from actuarial firm Milliman projected that, in California, the average silver plan would have a $450 monthly premium.” The actual costs? Kliff continues, “On average, the most affordable “silver plan” – which covers 70 percent of the average subscriber’s medical costs – comes with a $276 monthly premium.

Dont get me wrong, it was a stupid thing to do and wrong, but I get why they did it, it was the easiset way to find the greatest percent of abusers.</Msg><Username>sec_fordummies</Username><Timestamp>1369591147063</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 13:59:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369592024743-26</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary-Dumbo scandal fest gets major traction</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369429062593</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 16:57:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WOW!

Oh and pay attention, I do admit I'm speculating, but it's highly educated speculation from years of watching government programs started out with every good intention turn into baskets of regulations that ultimately hurt the economy not in general so much but in those areas where the "ones set of rules fit all" don't actually fit.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369599355821</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 16:15:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369609981370-29</Id><Title>checking the box for "no" on whether it planned to participate in politics (liars &amp; frauds &amp; gaming the IRS)</Title><Msg>On the very day in 2008 that the American Future Fund mailed its application to the IRS, checking the box for "no" on whether it planned to participate in politics, it uploaded an ad to YouTube praising a Republican senator. The group reported more than $8 million in political spending in 2010. One reason the IRS struggles is that it can't match the speed of politics. By the time some groups submitted tax returns spelling out the millions they put into the 2010 election, they had stopped operating, or disbanded and reformed under new names, ProPublica found. The most politically active social welfare groups — former Minnesota Republican Sen. Norm Coleman's American Action Network and GOP strategist Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS — only filed tax returns covering fall 2010 in the spring of this year. The Republican Jewish Coalition, though formed in 1985, in many ways epitomizes the new breed of political-minded social welfare nonprofits. The group's initial IRS application said it would not engage in politics, yet its 2010 tax return says it gave almost $3.8 million to other groups for political activities. Separately, the Republican Jewish Coalition told the FEC it spent more than $1.1 million on political ads, money that wasn't reported to the IRS. Together, the grants and the political advertising made up almost 40 percent of the total expenditures of the group, which is chaired by GOP super donor and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369609981370</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 19:13:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369610165573-30</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare already Repealed</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369510398195</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 15:33:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL !

Is the filibuster being abused wherever it now takes 60 votes to pass anything? DOLE: No doubt about it. There are some cases we can probably justify it, but not many. WALLACE: What do you think of your party, of the Republicans, today? DOLE: I think they ought to put a sign on the national committee doors that says closed for repairs until New Year’s Day next year and spend that time going over ideas and positive agendas.
