I'm looking for someone who has had a margin account at E*Trade dating back to 2006. I need to get my hands on their historical published margin interest rates, as I believe I have been overcharged. I need them by month dating back to Oct. 2006. Typically, they are held steady for months at a time, so it might not be that difficult to check. Anyone out there who can help? Thanks a million.</Msg><Username>ramilos1992</Username><Timestamp>1355746597293</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 07:16:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
