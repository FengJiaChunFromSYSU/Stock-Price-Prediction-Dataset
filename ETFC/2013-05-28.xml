Since no other part of the bill has seen implementation it would be hard to find more than the one failure. Most of the collapses, like the last ditch insurance plan, will last at least two years after implementation, and with full implementation not scheduled until early 2014, that means the weight of those failures will fall on the NEXT President, even if he is perfectly aware of them, unless his party controls the house he won't be able to avoid them. You can keep almost any government program running two years on hope and promises, after that you had better be able to point to reasonable results or people may start asking questions . . . And given the attention this bill has gotten even before the relevant agency law has been crafted (in fact the end result of this bill will almost entirely be agency law since the legislatures dropped the ball on specifics) anything short of reasonable success given resources invested will invite condemnation. Frankly I hope it works, and that eventually the government fells comfortable dissolving the VA in favor of some kind of government blue cross/blue shield card, but until they do that I'm going to be convinced that the ACA is nothing but a shell game.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369752734040</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 10:52:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369752860763-13</Id><Title>This could explain why ETFC is up today</Title><Msg>The announcement of 10% increase in home sales price is very good for ETFC.

However, I fully expect the two U.S. senators from Oklahoma, James Inhofe and Tom Coburn, who voted consistently against FEMA funding and voted down relief for Hurricane Sandy relief, to reject federal aid and rely solely on the Red Cross, private charities and direct relief donations to rebuild. Both senators are extreme fiscal hawks and believe in small government, rugged individualism and personal responsibility. This crisis will test their resolve and adherence to this ideology. However, in the end, hypocrisy on this would not surprise me. The voters should rise up and reject public funding as they rejected government regulations to build safer schools that might have saved the lives of the children who were killed as a result of the tornado.</Msg><Username>bypartisan305</Username><Timestamp>1369763079530</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 13:44:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369763121842-22</Id><Topic><Title>scandalous tea party conressman who feeds in the public trough</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369614491860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 20:28:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Heritage is correct. As most government programs, farm subsidies by addressing one problem creates opportunity for fraud and abuse. But once those subsidies are available to every farmer, they should take it, or else they jeopardize their business in case things do go south and without those subsidies they wouldn't be able to compete with other farmers who took advantage of farm subsidies, i.e. unable to sell their product for competitive price. So first, your beloved government distributes money to all farmers, than it blames farmers for taking it? It's corruption on highest level. Put everyone in same conditions. Either eliminate the whole darn program and let chips fall where they may, or shut up with blaming farmer for accepting those funds.

Radio Shack hurt me more than this stock EVER could because Radio Shack, despite it's name, hasn't made any real money in years. This stock was a fish in a barrel, but I insisted on falling for the dividends trap, and a CEO who promised A and did Z. Not gonna do that again. Senior management tells a big enough lie I eat my losses and move on, remembering that location as a place to NOT put money.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369770588579</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 15:49:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369770661431-32</Id><Topic><Title>Political Correct #$%$-London Beheading</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369321973958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 11:12:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not always.</Msg><Username>muchomacho42</Username><Timestamp>1369770661431</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 15:51:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369770696956-33</Id><Topic><Title>'SPANKER" admits being wrong about whining toilet paper issues and Gerbil Stuffing</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1368971176186</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 09:46:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'SPANKER' had to visit emergency room to removed used, dead ,rotting Gerbil from his 'never use toilet paper' smelly DUMP-o</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369770696956</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 15:51:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369771770107-34</Id><Topic><Title>Another Obama TRIUMPH!!</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369750953872</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 10:22:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Enlighten us..

We’ll just have to wait and see whether the Affordable Care Act, as the health care law is officially known, surprises us on the downside. But there is one area where the law already appears to be surprising on the upside. And that is the number of health care information start-ups it’s spurring. This is a big deal. The combination of Obamacare regulations, incentives in the recovery act for doctors and hospitals to shift to electronic records and the releasing of mountains of data held by the Department of Health and Human Services is creating a new marketplace and platform for innovation — a health care Silicon Valley — that has the potential to create better outcomes at lower costs by changing how health data are stored, shared and mined. It’s a new industry.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369775566694</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 17:12:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369775742577-42</Id><Topic><Title>AG Eric Holder has no reason to resign</Title><Username>elksmember</Username><Timestamp>1369765573640</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:26:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pacificant, Alberto Gonzales announced today that effective September 17, he would step down as Attorney General.

Alberto Gonzales: Will Lie for Food The New York Times reports that the former attorney general can't find a job. That should be the least of his problems. April 14, 2008 | Days after it is finally confirmed that the highest officials in American government signed off on torture in the days after 9/11, pending "a legal opinion on the legality of these tactics" in order to justify them, the New York Times reports that former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, "like many others recently unemployed," is having trouble getting a job. "Mr. Gonzales, the former attorney general, who was forced to resign last year, has been unable to interest law firms in adding his name to their roster, Washington lawyers and his associates said in recent interviews." Can't really call it accountability. Karma? Not unless one of his job interviews has involved waterboarding. After all, for all the current controversy, it's not exactly news that the famous "torture memos" were authorized by Gonzales. But, about his job search: "What makes Mr. Gonzales's case extraordinary," the Times goes on, in typical dispassionate-to-the-point-of-obtuse tone, "is that former attorneys general, the government's chief lawyer, are typically highly sought." Hm, yes. Highly unusual. In fact, what made Alberto Gonzales extraordinary was his criminal conduct as the top law enforcement officer in the country. Half a year has passed since the attorney general resigned, skulking out of the Department of Justice to the dismay of no one but President Bush. But it's hardly a distant memory what a destructive figure he was at the DoJ.

He did the same- but this time for Mitt Romney-in 2012,although he did hold out until April before endorsing the former Massachusetts governor. Much of his public speculation in 2012 stemmed from his dislike of President Obama- including his hiring of private investigators to search for Obama's 'real' birth certificate.
