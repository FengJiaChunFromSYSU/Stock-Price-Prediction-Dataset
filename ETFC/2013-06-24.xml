Don't know much about the case either, but ready to pass the judgement. ROBERT ZIMMERMAN, GEORGE ZIMMERMAN'S FATHER: He went to the next street, realized where he was and he was walking back to his vehicle. It's my understanding that at that point Trayvon Martin walked up to him, asked him, do you have a (bleep) problem? George said, no, I don't have a problem. And started to reach for his cell phone. At that point, he was punched in the nose, his nose was broken and he was knocked to the concrete. Trayvon Martin got on top of him and just started beating him -- in the face, in his nose, hitting his head on the concrete. This "little" detail was heard on several news channels including CNN. Although, there are no witnesses who could confirm this to be the case. But it makes much more sense than provoking a brawl while having a gun in his pocket. Another "little" detail you missed is that right after incident Zimmerman was questioned for several hours in police department and released without criminal case being made. That is, his side of the story was believable. What's most important is that there are 2 stories here, not one of yours.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1372059648954</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 03:40:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372082296302-2</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting NSA surveillance twist</Title><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1371821926742</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 09:38:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"believable story" does not make it the truth.

As usual, you invent your facts. Zimmer did NOT have a broken nose. He had a scratch on his nose, and a bump on the back of his head. Nothing required stitches. He probably hurt himself while trying not to pee his pants. I was listening this AM to part of the trial. The source of Zimmer's injuries are unconfirmed. Remember, he wasn't bruised when he went to the police station.

Conservatives and Republican lawmakers charged that the IRS was operating under directions from the White House to target the president’s political enemies. But these internal documents show screeners were not only using the term “tea party” to scrutinize applications, but also the keywords “Israel,” “Occupy,” and “Progressive.” The new acting chief of the IRS, Danny Werfel, told reporters that an internal investigation had uncovered a much broader use of the “Be On The Look Out” (BOLO) lists that flagged certain groups. While these lists contained “inappropriate criteria,” a preliminary examination has not found any suggestion of improper screening outside of the office that examines groups seeking tax-exempt status and affirmed that there was no “evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the IRS or involvement in these matters by anyone outside the IRS.” In order to prevent more inappropriate targeting of both conservative and liberal groups, the IRS is implementing a new fast-track process for applications that have not gotten a response from the IRS within 120 days. No conservative groups’ applications were ultimately denied, but Republicans have still likened the IRS to Al-Qaeda and called for its abolishment. Many lawmakers have seized on the scandal to argue that the IRS be stripped of its power to implement the Affordable Care Act lest the agency deny health care access for conservatives.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372122343420</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 21:05:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372126839016-26</Id><Title>If Zimmerman wanted to kill the punk</Title><Msg>Zimmerman could have shot Trayvon and left him.
