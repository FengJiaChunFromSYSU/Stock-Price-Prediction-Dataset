The U.S. flag is displayed upside-down, which under the flag code is a distress signal. Several prominent members of the military and national security communities, particularly those who favor a more realist approach to international relations, have been critical of both the decision to invade Iraq and the prosecution of the War. On July 28, 2002, eight months before the invasion of Iraq, the Washington Post reported that "many senior U.S. military officers" including members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff opposed an invasion on the grounds that the policy of containment was working.[8] A few days later, Gen. Joseph P. Hoar (Ret.) warned the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the invasion was risky and perhaps unnecessary. Morton Halperin, a foreign policy expert with the Council on Foreign Relations and Center for American Progress warned that an invasion would increase the terrorist threat.[9] In a 2002 book, Scott Ritter, a Nuclear Weapons Inspector in Iraq from 1991–98, argued against an invasion and expressed doubts about the Bush Administration’s claims that Saddam Hussein had a WMD capability.[10] Brent Scowcroft, who served as National Security Adviser to President George H.W. Bush was an early critic. He wrote an August 15, 2002 editorial in The Wall Street Journal entitled "Don't attack Saddam," arguing that the war would distract from the broader fight against terrorism and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which should be the U.S.'s highest priority in the Middle East.[11] The next month, Gen. Hugh Shelton, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, agreed that war in Iraq would distract from the War on Terrorism.[12]</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363791986362</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:06:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363792133406-14</Id><Topic><Title>Bush and Cheney should be jailed</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363740588019</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 20:49:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, former head of Central Command for U.S. forces in the Middle East and State Department's envoy to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, echoed many of Scowcroft's concerns in an October 2002 speech at the Middle East Institute. In a follow-up interview with Salon, Zinni said he was "not convinced we need to do this now," arguing that deposing Saddam Hussein was only the sixth or seventh top priority in the Middle East, behind the Middle East peace process, reforming Iran, our commitments in Afghanistan, and several others.[13] By January 19, 2003, TIME Magazine reported that "as many as 1 in 3 senior officers questions the wisdom of a preemptive war with Iraq."[14] On February 13, 2003 Ambassador Joseph Wilson, former chargé d'affaires in Baghdad, resigned from the Foreign Service and publicly questioned the need for another war in Iraq.[15] After the War started, he wrote an editorial in the New York Times titled What I Didn't Find in Africa that claimed to discredit a Bush Administration claim that Iraq had attempted to procure uranium from Niger.[16] John Brady Kiesling, another career diplomat with similar reservations, resigned in a public letter in the New York Times on February 27.[17] He was followed on March 10 by John H. Brown, a career diplomat with 22 years of service,[18] and on March 19 by Mary Ann Wright, a diplomat with 15 years of service in the State Department following a military career of 29 years.[19] The war started the next day. Lt. Col. Karen Kwiatkowski (Ret.) was political/military desk officer at the Defense Department’s office for Near East South Asia (NESA) in the months before the war. In December 2003 she began to write an anonymous column that described the disrupting influence of the Office of Special Plans on the analysis that led to the decision to go to war.[20]</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363792133406</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:08:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363792780665-15</Id><Topic><Title>Colrado!</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1363753775621</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 00:29:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>First, try to spell 'Colorado.'</Msg><Username>mybmw49</Username><Timestamp>1363792780665</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:19:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363792863794-16</Id><Topic><Title>Just in, Ch. 11 Minneapolis!</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1363749157968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 23:12:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>First, learn the difference between "reply's" and "replies."</Msg><Username>mybmw49</Username><Timestamp>1363792863794</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363793019002-17</Id><Topic><Title>Get latest Information in ETFC</Title><Username>jonesmichael636</Username><Timestamp>1363198541739</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 14:15:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this report</Msg><Username>carlmoore584</Username><Timestamp>1363793019002</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:23:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363793243498-18</Id><Topic><Title>Bush and Cheney should be jailed</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363740588019</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 20:49:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Congressional opposition U.S. Congressional opposition to American involvement in wars and interventions United States 1812 North America House Federalists’ Address 1847 Mexican–American War Spot Resolutions 1917 World War I Filibuster of the Armed Ship Bill 1935–1939 Neutrality Acts 1935–1940 Ludlow Amendment 1970 Vietnam McGovern–Hatfield Amendment 1970 Southeast Asia Cooper–Church Amendment 1971 Vietnam Repeal of Tonkin Gulf Resolution 1973 Southeast Asia Case–Church Amendment 1973 War Powers Resolution 1974 Hughes–Ryan Amendment 1976 Angola Clark Amendment 1982 Nicaragua Boland Amendment 2007 Iraq House Concurrent Resolution 63 v t e President George Bush, surrounded by leaders of the House and Senate, announces the Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq, October 2, 2002. Opinion in the U.S. Congress leading up to the Iraq War generally favored a diplomatic solution, while supporting military intervention should diplomacy fail. The October 11, 2002 resolution that authorized President Bush to use force in Iraq passed the Senate by a vote of 77 to 23, and the House by 296 to 133.[36][37] Leading opponents of the resolution included Senators Russ Feingold and Edward Kennedy. As the war progressed and the insurgency began to develop into what many believe is a civil war in Iraq, Congressional support for the Iraq campaign began to wane. A flashpoint came on November 17, 2005, when Representative John Murtha, a Vietnam combat veteran who voted to authorize the war and is widely regarded as an ardent supporter of the military, introduced a resolution calling for U.S. forces in Iraq to be "redeployed at the earliest practicable date" to stand as a quick-reaction force in U.S. bases in neighboring countries such as Kuwait.[38]</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363793243498</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:27:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363794113069-19</Id><Topic><Title>Bush and Cheney should be jailed</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363740588019</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 20:49:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Religious opposition On September 13, 2002, US Catholic bishops signed a letter to President Bush stating that any "preemptive, unilateral use of military force to overthrow the government of Iraq" could not be justified at the time. They came to this position by evaluating whether an attack against Iraq would satisfy the criteria for a just war as defined by Catholic theology. US civil-rights leader the Reverend Jesse Jackson condemned the planned invasion, saying in February 2003 that it was not too late to stop the war and that people "must march until there is a declaration of peace and reconciliation."[62] The Vatican also spoke out against war in Iraq. Archbishop Renato Raffaele Martino, a former U.N. envoy and current prefect of the Council for Justice and Peace, told reporters that war against Iraq was a preventive war and constituted a "war of aggression", and thus did not constitute a just war. The foreign minister, Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, expressed concerns that a war in Iraq would inflame anti-Christian feelings in the Islamic world. On February 8, 2003, Pope John Paul II said "we should never resign ourselves, almost as if war is inevitable."[63] He spoke out again on March 22, 2003, shortly after the invasion began, saying that violence and arms "can never resolve the problems of man."[64][65][66] Both the outgoing Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and his successor, Rowan Williams, spoke out against war with Iraq. The executive committee of the World Council of Churches, an organization representing churches with a combined membership of between 350 million and 450 million Christians from over 100 countries,[67] issued a statement in opposition to war with Iraq, stating that "War against Iraq would be immoral, unwise, and in breach of the principles of the United Nations Charter."[68] Jim Wallis of Sojourners Magazine has argued that "most major church bodies around the world" opposed the war.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363794113069</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 11:41:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363795007302-20</Id><Topic><Title>The Ryan Plan: Cutting Benefits For Poor Women To Protect Millionaires</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363357690294</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 10:28:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You spelled an absolute lunacy.

Ron Paul has said that "The war in Iraq was sold to us with false information. The area is more dangerous now than when we entered it. We destroyed a regime hated by our direct enemies, the jihadists, and created thousands of new recruits for them. This war has cost more than 3,000 American lives, thousands of seriously wounded, and hundreds of billions of dollars."[43] Barack Obama (who went on to win the election) was not a senator at the time of the voting of the Iraq War Resolution, but has repeatedly voiced his disapproval of it both before and during his senatorship, saying at an anti war rally in Chicago on October 2, 2002: "I am not opposed to all wars. I’m opposed to dumb wars." He also spoke of the "undetermined length... undetermined cost, [and] undetermined consequences" which even a successful war would bring.[44][45] Dodd voted in favor of the Iraq War Resolution in 2002, but Dodd has since become an opponent of the war.[46] Dodd has said the Iraq War has been waged “for all the wrong reasons” and that it is eroding both the nation's security and its moral leadership.[47]</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363799941442</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 13:19:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363800330244-26</Id><Topic><Title>Just in, Ch. 11 Minneapolis!</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1363749157968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 23:12:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bidder, I don't care about grammar and spelling, it's the content it counts!

The naive, head-in-the clouds liberal dreamers said it was more likely about oil. Ten years and thousands of lives later we have found neither WMDs nor any evidence of an Iraqi connection to the events of 9/11. However, a consortium of Western oil companies, led by Exxon and BP, is currently pumping crude in Iraq and hopes, by 2020, to produce as much oil annually as does Saudi Arabia. Quite a prize. I think the Iraq war was a taxpayer-funded, trillion-dollar subsidy for the petroleum industry. But then, as a liberal, maybe I'm just naive.</Msg><Username>rampant_rose</Username><Timestamp>1363804014242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 14:26:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363804049504-32</Id><Topic><Title>LQQK= 13 Indicator ETFC Research Report =LQQK</Title><Username>marcoblynk</Username><Timestamp>1363428509515</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 06:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>exelent information</Msg><Username>namelens</Username><Timestamp>1363804049504</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 14:27:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363804378165-33</Id><Title>Ride etfc</Title><Msg>good for this year to 20..ride the feds gravy train..</Msg><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1363804378165</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 14:32:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363805469580-34</Id><Topic><Title>The Ryan Plan: Cutting Benefits For Poor Women To Protect Millionaires</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363357690294</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 10:28:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- "75% of promissed SS payments". This is insolvency, since obligation is to pay 100%. Where did you find word BROKE in my post? If Bush depleted SS funds to pay for war in Iraq, than we should start talking about insolvency back in 2008, not by 2035. - 2000 budget surplus was only around $200B. This surplus was spent in 2001: recovery from 9/11, war in Afghanistan and tax rebates. Plus, federal revenue in 2001 fell $67B short of year 2000 due to recession started in Novermber 2000. Now: "surpluses that the govt had received for years was not put into any special place, it was handed to the govt to spend as they saw fit, and the people who paid into it were handed an IOU from the US govt" Received for years? There were no years with surpluses after 2000. What surpluses are you talking about? Not putting non-existent surpluses in 2001-2008 into SS means taking away from SS? Had a bad dream? Look, BSD(Bush derangement syndrome) is a condition. If left untreated, it leads to serious complications like inability to make sense.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has awarded $2.7 million to study why lesbians are at a higher “risk for hazardous drinking.” The University of Illinois has received grants since 2009 for its project, "Cumulative Stress and Hazardous Drinking in a Community of Adult Lesbians," which aims to develop “culturally sensitive” strategies to prevent lesbians from being drunks. “Studies using both probability and nonprobability samples provide ample evidence of lesbians' vulnerability to hazardous drinking,” the grant’s description reads. “However, very little is known about the factors that increase lesbians' risk for hazardous drinking.” “We propose to build on and extend our study of sexual identity and drinking… to model effects of cumulative stress on hazardous drinking among lesbians.” The researchers theorize that lesbians report higher rates of traumatic events, making them more likely to engage in hazardous drinking, which has been defined by NIH’s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as “more than 7 drinks per week or more than 3 drinks per occasion for women.”</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363811176110</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:26:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363811980716-41</Id><Topic><Title>Feds Spend $2.7M to Study Drunk Lesbians</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363811176110</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:26:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep frustration will lead to excess eating and drinking...maybe if the male half was able to grow a #$%$ , some of problem may go away..</Msg><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1363811980716</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363812079180-42</Id><Topic><Title>Feds Spend $2.7M to Study Drunk Lesbians</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363811176110</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:26:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe insensitive jerks like yourself and bidder are the problem.</Msg><Username>sec_fordummies</Username><Timestamp>1363812079180</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:41:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363812377553-43</Id><Topic><Title>LQQK= 13 Indicator ETFC Research Report =LQQK</Title><Username>marcoblynk</Username><Timestamp>1363428509515</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 06:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow nice news</Msg><Username>edmundofereta</Username><Timestamp>1363812377553</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:46:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363812420720-44</Id><Topic><Title>LQQK= 13 Indicator ETFC Research Report =LQQK</Title><Username>marcoblynk</Username><Timestamp>1363428509515</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 06:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow nice news</Msg><Username>edmundofereta</Username><Timestamp>1363812420720</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:47:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363812802972-45</Id><Title>Charles Pierce to the Iraq revisionists</Title><Msg>"Shut up, all of you.

In part this comes from the mythology about Vietnam that surfaced during the Reagan years, the idea that returning troops were scorned, and that anything less than full support for the atrocities of war amounted to contempt for the poor dopes that were drafted or (in the case of Iraq) who signed up because they thought a quick tour would pay for college was a failure of patriotism. It says something about the caliber of the intellects that buy this argument that it was originally promulgated by Sylvester Stallone. As close as we will ever get to an apology is Colin Powell whining that he was tricked."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363827449239</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 20:57:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363831577014-61</Id><Title>An unnecessary war</Title><Msg>Bruce Riedel, formerly a senior CIA official and presidential adviser, views the transition as such: "The Iraq War elected Barack Obama and transformed American foreign policy.

The shadow of this war, he continues, "weighs heavily" on the stances that America is now assuming toward Iran, Syria and Libya.

To be sure, a vast array of articles, books and films have documented how pre-war intelligence was "manipulated" or "misrepresented" or "twisted" or "cherry-picked" or "fixed around the policy," and how the Bush Administration's inadequate planning produced a "fiasco," a "blunder," and a "disaster" -- terms used to convey the sinister nature and catastrophic effect of White House miscalculations without actually accusing anyone of anything so incriminating as a felony. Two notable exceptions are former Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi's book, "The Prosecution of George W. Bush for Murder," which encountered a virtual boycott by the major news media when published in 2008, and "United States v. George W. Bush et al.," by Elizabeth de la Vega, a former Assistant U.S Attorney who meticulously presents the case for criminal fraud under a little-known federal statute that does not require monetary loss by the victim as a condition for conviction. Both books rest their case on proof of deliberate deception by the President and members of his war cabinet -- not an easy hurdle to overcome in a criminal trial, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831606028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:06:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363831716344-63</Id><Topic><Title>The US Invasion of Iraq Was a Crime and Its Perpetrators Are Murderers</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831606028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Contrary to common belief, however, an American president can be found guilty of criminal conduct without proof of the corrupt state of mind of the deliberate liar or the malignant motives of Nazis on trial at Nuremberg. The criminal mind also encompasses the all-too-common consciousness of human beings acting carelessly in deciding to kill other human beings, however justified their conduct may seem in their own eyes. On the tenth anniversary of the invasion, the only truly serious question about the war is whether President George W. Bush and those who participated in the decision to invade Iraq did anything illegal or unconstitutional or criminal. To raise such a question about a war initiated by own's own country is always "a vocation of agony," as Martin Luther King, Jr. said of the war in Vietnam when he finally chose in 1967 to break his silence about the conflict. Whatever the reasons for avoiding the Iraq question, whether it is President Obama's understandable fear of further polarizing a sorely divided nation, or out of respect for the 4,422 Americans who gave their lives fighting for what they believed was a just cause, or because the legal issues are too big or too difficult, we must finally say about Iraq what Dr. King said about Vietnam. "We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak." The whole litany of excuses for the catastrophe in Iraq has been recited in the language of mistake and misadventure, as if the war were a tragic accident, like a colossal train wreck caused by an act of God.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831716344</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:08:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363831806324-64</Id><Topic><Title>The US Invasion of Iraq Was a Crime and Its Perpetrators Are Murderers</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831606028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Intentional killings based on a mistake are not accidents, however, if the mistake was predicated on an unreasonable belief about the justification for the killing. This is the case whether the person on trial is a police officer who killed an innocent citizen in the mistaken belief that the suspect had a gun and presented a lethal threat, or a president who ordered the invasion of Iraq in the mistaken belief that Saddam Hussein possessed WMDs that posed a threat to America's national security. If a police officer's belief that his victim posed a deadly threat was not only wrong, but unreasonable, in the sense that a prudent police officer exercising due diligence in similar circumstances would not have fired his weapon, the killing constitutes criminal homicide. There is considerable disagreement among the courts and legal commentators about whether the homicide is murder or is to be treated more leniently, either as voluntary manslaughter or the lesser offense of negligent homicide, but there is universal agreement that carelessness in the use of deadly force is criminal. What did the President know and when did he know it? Wrong question. The proper question is: What should a reasonably prudent president have known about the legal justification for invading Iraq and why didn't the President know it?</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831806324</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:10:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363831879148-65</Id><Topic><Title>The US Invasion of Iraq Was a Crime and Its Perpetrators Are Murderers</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831606028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We are so used to war and the threat of war as a legitimate adjunct of foreign policy that we easily lose sight of the reality that war consists of acts which, if performed by a private citizen or organization, would constitute serious felonies: mass murder, assaults with deadly weapons, maiming, arson, kidnaping, and the malicious destruction of property. The law immunizes political leaders from criminal liability so long as the war is legally justified. As a matter of international law, this generally means in compliance with the U.N. Charter. In terms of domestic law, it means in compliance with the U.S. Consitution, which requires either a declaration of war or a congressional authorization for the use of military force. A careful reading of the Authorization for the Use of Force adopted by large bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate shows the congressional authorization was hardly the "blank check" the news media portrayed it as. Congress limited the President's use of military force against Iraq by authorizing war only to: (1) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq, and (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831879148</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:11:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363831925092-66</Id><Topic><Title>The US Invasion of Iraq Was a Crime and Its Perpetrators Are Murderers</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831606028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The use of the word "and" after the first paragraph is critical. While Congress did not require an imminent or immediate threat, it was not prepared to authorize the President to go to war over a violation of a Security Council Resolution involving WMDs unless there was also some likelihood that if left unchecked, Saddam would present a "continuing threat" of using those weapons against the United States in the foreseeable future. In fact, there was no continuing threat because Saddam did not actually possess any WMDs. Nor were there reasonable grounds to believe at the time of the invasion that Saddam Hussein presented such a threat. The October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (pdf), prepared for the President by the CIA and other intelligence agencies and made available to him five months before the invasion, made clear that while there were reasonable grounds to believe that "Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons," Saddam would not use them against the United States unless Iraq were attacked by us or threatened with an "imminent or unavoidable" attack. The NIE, originally classified as Top Secret and released to the public in July 2003, contained this Key Judgment: "Baghdad for now appears to be drawing a line short of conducting terrorist attacks with conventional or CBW [chemical and biological warfare] against the United States, fearing that exposure of Iraq involvement would provide Washington a stronger case for making war. Iraq probably would attempt clandestine attacks against the US Homeland if Baghdad feared [that] an attack that threatened the survival of the regime were imminent or unavoidable, or possibly for revenge."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831925092</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:12:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363832061902-67</Id><Topic><Title>The US Invasion of Iraq Was a Crime and Its Perpetrators Are Murderers</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831606028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In other words, a reasonably prudent president would have known from reading the NIE that as long as the United States did not attack or threaten to attack, Iraq posed no continuing threat to the United States, as the congressional authorization required. A reasonable president therefore would have known that invading Iraq would have been unconstitutional. If President Bush knew he had no constitutional authority to go to war, then he knowingly broke the law and a properly instructed jury would have little difficulty in finding him guilty of murder. Even if he was not conscious of any wrongdoing, which seems more likely, a jury would still be warranted in finding him guilty, at the very least, of criminally negligent homicide if it found that his ignorance constituted a failure to perform the duties of his office with due diligence. The mother whose dead body was found in the bombed ruins of Baghdad, holding her baby so tight they could not be pried apart and had to be buried together, can no longer be dismissed as "collateral damage." That mother and child, and the more than 3,000 Iraqi civilians killed directly by U.S. bombs and artillery fire in the first month alone, as well as the Iraqi troops killed while defending their country against an arguably unlawful and unreasonable attack, may have been victims of criminal homicide.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363832061902</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:14:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363832103400-68</Id><Topic><Title>The US Invasion of Iraq Was a Crime and Its Perpetrators Are Murderers</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363831606028</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:06:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Without criminal trials, we will never know. The law, Justice Holmes reminded us, is nothing more than a prediction of how courts will rule in particular cases, and in cases involving jury trial, we should add, a prediction of what jurors will decide in applying the law to the facts. Until we have court decisions and jury verdicts, statements about the legality or constitutionality or criminality of the war in Iraq, or enhanced interrogations, or targeted killings, or the "war on terror" itself, will remain on the Opinion Page and continue to elude even the judgment of history.
