Basically, it is the same plan, as we have seen numerous times. Looks like Idzik is another chicken CEO that does not put any dates or interim steps in his plan. The ultimate goal is to make 1 Billion in earnings., yada, yada, yada............ Is that in 5, 10, or 20 years ?????? Not a one of these loser CEO's will tell us what kind of reductions or earnings we can expect in 2013, forget the ultimate!!!! I am not saying the plan is bad. I am not saying they are not executing on the plan. I am asking why we need to hire, fire and provide 3 CEO's with golden parachutes to execute the plan while shareholders pay the tab????????</Msg><Username>gar4one</Username><Timestamp>1370665987817</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 00:33:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370667422490-2</Id><Title>ETFC Is Going All The Way Up To $120.00 Per Share.
