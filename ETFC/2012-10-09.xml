They scoff at his status as a Nobel laureate. They say he's full of it. Yet they're utterly incapable of refuting what he says, and completely at a loss to compete with his overarching vision of what it means to be a Republican these days. Very telling that they are unprepared to tackle an especially incendiary observation - "It is, quite simply, frightening to think that a movement this deranged wields so much political power" - preferring to let it stand unchallenged rather than risk further embarrassment.</Msg><Username>bami2012</Username><Timestamp>1349758689616</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 00:58:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349775214710-2</Id><Title>Paul Krugman-Communist Economist</Title><Msg>If you want to institute a Communist Totalitarian regime, then call Paul Krugman to help destroy all wealth!!

Not only was the state not, in early 2003, in the kind of free fall that the United States was in when Barack Obama took office, but under Romney Massachusetts' recovery lagged behind almost every other state.

That is exactly what Romney has said about Obama's presidency—but it's actually something worse than just "silly."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349792425114</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:20:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349792771855-12</Id><Topic><Title>Truth About Jobs By PAUL KRUGMAN, 10/8/12</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349751445794</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 22:57:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Job numbers are prepared by professional civil servants, at an agency that currently has no political appointees................ Is the U.S. employment picture getting better? Yes, it is.................................... ......................On the employer side, the current numbers say that over the past year the economy added 150,000 jobs a month, and revisions will probably push that number up significantly. That’s well above the 90,000 or so added jobs per month that we need to keep up with population. (This number used to be higher, but underlying work force growth has dropped off sharply now that many baby boomers are reaching retirement age.) But remember those aging baby boomers: the fraction of American adults who are in their prime working years is falling fast. Once you take the effects of an aging population into account, the numbers show a substantial improvement in the employment picture since the summer of 2011.......... ............ we should be doing better — a shortfall largely due to the scorched-earth tactics of Republicans, who have blocked any and all efforts to accelerate the pace of recovery. (If the American Jobs Act, proposed by the Obama administration last year, had been passed, the unemployment rate would probably be below 7 percent.)" Krugman could add that some of the sluggishness in job growth is due to problems in Euroland and weakness in China , neither BO's fault. And the loss of 600k Gv't jobs under BO is unprecedented for any Prez fighting an inherited recession.

Would You Believe It's Barack Obama? It’s enough to make even the most ardent Obama cynic scratch his head in confusion. Amidst all the cries of Barack Obama being the most prolific big government spender the nation has ever suffered, Marketwatch is reporting that our president has actually been tighter with a buck than any United States president since Dwight D. Eisenhower. Who knew? Yep, Obama's a Big Spender...Just Like His Predecessors Capital Flows Capital Flows Contributor Check out the chart – So, how have the Republicans managed to persuade Americans to buy into the whole “Obama as big spender” narrative? It might have something to do with the first year of the Obama presidency where the federal budget increased a whopping 17.9% —going from $2.98 trillion to $3.52 trillion. I’ll bet you think that this is the result of the Obama sponsored stimulus plan that is so frequently vilified by the conservatives…but you would be wrong. The first year of any incoming president term is saddled—for better or for worse—with the budget set by the president whom immediately precedes the new occupant of the White House. Indeed, not only was the 2009 budget the property of George W. Bush—and passed by the 2008 Congress—it was in effect four months before Barack Obama took the oath of office. Accordingly, the first budget that can be blamed on our current president began in 2010 with the budgets running through and including including fiscal year 2013 standing as charges on the Obama account, even if a President Willard M. Romney takes over the office on January 20, 2013. So, how do the actual Obama annual budgets look? Courtesy of Marketwatch- In fiscal 2010 (the first Obama budget) spending fell 1.8% to $3.46 trillion. In fiscal 2011, spending rose 4.3% to $3.60 trillion. In fiscal 2012, spending is set to rise 0.7% to $3.63 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the budget that was agreed to last August. Finally in fiscal 2013 — the final budget of Obama’s term — spending is scheduled to fall 1.3% to $3.58 trillion. Read the CBO’s latest budget outlook. No doubt, many will wish to give the credit to the efforts of the GOP controlled House of Representatives. That’s fine if that’s what works for you. However, you don’t get to have it both ways. Credit whom you will, but if you are truly interested in a fair analysis of the Obama years to date—at least when it comes to spending—you’re going to have to acknowledge that under the Obama watch, even President Reagan would have to give our current president a thumbs up when it comes to his record for stretching a dollar."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349794330624</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 10:52:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349795195789-14</Id><Topic><Title>a typican quote from pacifican showing he is 100% wrong</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1349728033537</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 16:27:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Total revenue $2.7 trillion (requested) $2.105 trillion (enacted) Total expenditures $3.107 trillion (requested) $3.518 trillion (enacted) Deficit $407 billion (requested) $1.413 trillion (enacted) Understand what requested budget is?

Loy Mauch (R-AR) has been outed by the Arkansas Times for his pro-slavery, pro-Confederacy letters to the editor over the past decade. Mauch’s run for reelection this year is backed by the Arkansas Republican Party. In letters to the Democrat-Gazette, Mauch vehemently defended slavery and repeatedly suggested Jesus condoned it: If slavery were so God-awful, why didn’t Jesus or Paul condemn it, why was it in the Constitution and why wasn’t there a war before 1861?The South has always stood by the Constitution and limited government. When one attacks the Confederate Battle Flag, he is certainly denouncing these principles of government as well as Christianity.

The Republicans are rooting against the American economy and American workers. They believe that they will do better politically in the 2010 midterm elections -- and the 2012 presidential -- if the economy does worse. And for the last twenty months they have done everything they can to assure that outcome. Of course some will say that no, the Republicans just have a different view of what will create jobs than Democrats. And that is partly true. Generally their view is that whatever is in the short-term interest of the big Wall Street banks, insurance companies, big oil and their wealthy donors is what is "good for the economy." They implemented their program of tax cuts for the rich and allowing the reckless Wall Street banks to do whatever they pleased for eight long years. The result was a $2,000 decrease in real income for most Americans, a massive increase in incomes for the top two percent of the population, zero net private sector job creation, and the collapse of our economy. But it's not just their commitment to "trickle down" economics that has caused them to do everything in their power to block economic recovery. They believe that their political fortunes will rise if the fortunes of the rest of us decline. We can't let them be right. The most striking case in point is the small business jobs bill that will hit the Senate immediately after the recess. The bill provides financial incentives to small business to create new jobs. You'd think that any bill that infuses money into a key Republican constituency like small business would be met with open arms by the Republican minority. No such luck. They plan to filibuster the bill even though many of its provisions were lifted directly from measures authored by Republicans. The Republican anti-recovery crusade began with the stimulus. When President Obama took office, the economy and job market were in free fall. The month he took the oath of office, the economy lost 650,000 jobs. Virtually every mainstream economist agreed that an emergency stimulus package was necessary to avoid spiraling into another Great Depression. In a recession, the problem is not a sudden decline of the ability of the economy to produce goods and services. The problem is that the web of economic relationships is disrupted and creates an artificial decline of demand for products and services -- a demand deficit. Without adequate demand to buy their products, businesses lay off workers who have even less money to buy products, and the economy spirals into recession. Recessions result in incredible waste. All of the products and services that idle workers, plants and equipment could have created are simply not produced -- meaning that the society as a whole is poorer with fewer goods and services to go around. The solution to this problem is to create the economic demand to put people back to work and jump start the economy. But the only source of that demand is the government. The White House economic team -- and many progressive economists -- believed that a large stimulus was necessary to push the economy out of the economic ditch and get it going again. But the Republicans said no. Many opposed any stimulus at all. In the end, the price for the three Republicans who ultimately voted yes was a scaled-back stimulus that turned out to be enormously effective -- just not big enough to do the job. Even today, Republicans are campaigning against the stimulus, claiming it didn't work, even though the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office analysis finds that it created or saved 2.8 million jobs by the end of July and will probably have created or saved 3.5 million by the end of September. Without it, instead of the eight million jobs lost as a result of the Republican recession, we would have lost 11.5 million jobs. But of course politically, that would have been just fine with the Republicans. The effective size of the stimulus bill was about $717 billion, not counting the so-called Alternative Minimum Tax fix that Republicans forced into the bill that had no stimulative effect. Had the stimulus been $1.4 trillion, the odds are good it would have created another 3.5 million jobs. Think just how different both the economic and political situation would be today if the economy had generated another 3.5 million jobs in the last 20 months. But what about the deficit you say? First a good portion of the newly-generated, short-term deficit would have been offset by increased tax revenues generated from new wages and the new spending they created as they flowed through the economy. And over the long run, most economists agree that this kind of expenditure would have actually improved the deficit picture by jumpstarting overall economic growth. In fact, most of the budget surplus generated by the Clinton economic program came from just that -- the big-time economic growth of the late 1990's. But opposing and limiting the size of the stimulus was just the beginning of Republican attempts to throw sand in the gears of the recovery. They opposed the government rescue of GM that has proven to be one of our biggest economic bright spots. Instead of going into bankruptcy, or liquidating and costing thousands of additional jobs, GM actually turned a $2.2 billion profit in the first half of this year and is preparing a stock offering that will allow the government to sell off its stake at a potential profit. GM is now hiring new workers once again. Then there was the marathon Republican attempt to stop the extension of unemployment benefits that was finally defeated by Democrats earlier this summer. That delayed payment of benefits to millions of workers and cost the economy dearly. And there was the Republican filibuster of federal money for teachers, police, firefighters and other public servants. They caused hundreds of thousands of state employees to be laid off or furloughed. It finally passed the Senate with two Republican votes, but only after it was cut in half. It will prevent 300,000 layoffs. Every time a teacher is fired, it not only damages the economy in the short run, it also permanently damages our economic prospects -- and ability to compete in the world -- over the long run, by shortchanging the education of our next generation. All the while they have been opposing these jobs initiatives, Republicans have proposed -- with a straight face -- that we spend almost three quarters of a trillion dollars over the next 10 years on tax breaks for the top two percent of the population. And they have opposed Democratic attempts to end tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas -- one of the most profound causes of the decline of American manufacturing. Finally, there was virtually unanimous Republican opposition to the measure that began to rein in the recklessness of the big Wall Street banks that caused the collapse of the economy in the first place. For the last twenty months, Democrats have been pushing hard to get the economy out of the ditch. Not only have the Republicans refused to lend a hand, they have been actively throwing rocks under the wheels. The fact is they want to keep the economy in that ditch so they can divert attention from the fact that they were behind the wheel when it careened off the road. They hope that if they prevent it from getting back onto the pavement, the voters will forget about who put it in the ditch in the first place and blame the guys who are trying to get it out. They're counting on the frustration caused by the delay in getting the economy out of that ditch to be enough that the voters will turn once again to the culprits who put it there, throw them the keys and say "why don't you try it again." That, of course, will require a gigantic case of national amnesia. It would also be a political and economic disaster. We can't let them be successful. In particular, the Republicans hope that the frustration and the fatigue of struggling with the economic situation is just enough to make a large number of Democratic voters give up in disgust and simply stay home on Election Day. That's how the "1994 Republican Revolution" that gave us Newt Gingrich, and culminated in the election of George Bush, the Iraq War and the collapse of the economy began. In 1994, Democrats simply stayed home. We've seen that movie, and it ends badly. So unless you're up for more tales of economic collapse -- more stories of chaos and destruction, wasted lives and frustrated dreams -- don't let the Republicans succeed.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349824236962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 19:10:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349824256954-31</Id><Topic><Title>Another Obama achievement</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1349738634573</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 19:23:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>**You maroons never stop to think that there is also a RECORD number of Americans !

His positions have the rigidity of a wind sock. He's now weaseling away from Tea party lifers: Mitt Romney said Tuesday he has no plans to push for legislation limiting abortion, a softer stance from a candidate who has said he would "get rid of" funding for Planned Parenthood and appoint Supreme Court who would overturn Roe v. Wade. “There’s no legislation with regards to abortion that I’m familiar with that would become part of my agenda,” the Republican presidential nominee told The Des Moines Register in an interview. His statement could put him at odds with congressional Republicans who have made limiting abortion central to their messages. His own running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), has introduced bills to restrict access to abortion. And the Republican Party platform toughened its anti-abortion stance earlier this year. Both Romney and Ryan oppose abortion, but the presidential candidate supports exemptions while his running mate does not. Romney told the Register he will restrict abortion in one way, through an executive order banning U.S. foreign aid money to be used for abortions. Romney has previously vowed to end taxpayer money for Planned Parenthood, one of the most common ways in which Republicans have tried to restrict access to abortion. "Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that," he said in March, referring to budget cuts he would make as president. Romney said in September that he would prefer to appoint justices to the Supreme Court that would oppose Roe v. Wade. "I hope to appoint justices for the Supreme Court that will follow the law and the constitution," he said at the time on NBC's "Meet the Press." "And it would be my preference that they reverse Roe V. Wade and therefore they return to the people and their elected representatives the decisions with regards to this important issue." Romney said Tuesday his legislation will be focused on jobs and education, when asked whether he would push for other bills on women's issues. "Women are frequently asking about the massive amount of debt we’re passing on to the next generation," he told the Register.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349824628842</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 19:17:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349824652252-34</Id><Topic><Title>Turn ETFC Into Your Personal ATM!</Title><Username>loydnelson230</Username><Timestamp>1349788201433</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 09:10:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well it looks like we are finally going to see some profits from our investment</Msg><Username>wolfmorrow299</Username><Timestamp>1349824652252</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 19:17:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349827578916-35</Id><Title>Dipshidiot weasels on the 47% comments</Title><Msg>By now we are beginning to see he doesn't really believe in anything but seizing power. "WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney again distanced himself from his infamous 47 percent comments caught on video at a private fundraiser in May, telling CNN in an interview Tuesday night that, "the words that came out were not what I meant." This is the second time in as many weeks that the Republican nominee abandoned his position that the sentiment he expressed when he called 47 percent of the country government-dependent, self-identified victims was correct but poorly worded. Last week, he told Fox News' Sean Hannity that the comment was "completely wrong" as opposed to ineloquently stated. Interviewed by CNN host Wolf Blitzer, Romney repeated the line that, as president, he would work for "100 percent of the people," adding that, "what was stated in the tape was not referring to what kind of president I'd be." Asked what he would say to those funders if he had the opportunity to address them again on the topic, Romney offered the following: "Well, Wolf, as you know, I was talking about how do you get to 50.1 percent of the vote. I'd like to get 100 percent of the vote, but I figure that's not going to happen, so I was trying to tell contributors how I get to 50.1 percent. I think it's always a perilous course for a candidate to start talking about the mathematics of an election." Romney's walk back from the 47 percent comments underscores a general walk toward a more moderate plank during the last week. In his initial comment, he clearly wasn't just talking about electoral math. He lamented that he would never be able to convince those people who paid no federal income taxes to take personal responsibility for themselves.

But if that wasn't surprise enough, his new-found support for a Palestinian state was truly jaw-dropping. After all, throughout the 2012 campaign Romney hasn't just repeatedly rejected the notion of two-state solution in the Middle East, but mocked the very notion that peace between Israel and the Palestinians is possible at all. Speaking at the Virginia Military Institute, would-be President Romney asserted his commitment to be Middle East peacemaker-in-chief (around the 19:15 mark): "Finally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel. On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew." If those words Romney spoke to the American public seem incongruous coming from his mouth, that's because he said the exact opposite in private. During his now-infamous May closed door fundraiser, Governor Romney declared that as President he would not give peace a chance: "I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel, and these thorny issues, and I say, "There's just no way." And so what you do is you say, "You move things along the best way you can." You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognize that this is going to remain an unsolved problem. We live with it in China and Taiwan. All right, we have a potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it. We don't go to war to try and resolve it imminently." As it turns out, Romney hasn't been shy about brushing the two-state solution in public, either. As he first suggested earlier this year, Governor Romney has little use for the policy expressed by Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama to realize two states, Israel and Palestine, "living side by side" in peace and security. Instead, Palestinian ambitions for a nation of their own should be determined by Bibi Netanyahu alone. As Romney put it in a January 26 Republican debate: There are some people who say, should we have a two-state solution? And the Israelis would be happy to have a two-state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two-state solution. They want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say -- and the best way to have peace in the Middle East is not for us to vacillate and to appease, but is to say, we stand with our friend Israel. We are committed to a Jewish state in Israel. We will not have an inch of difference between ourselves and our ally, Israel. Or to be more accurate, not a single inch of difference between President Romney and his good friend and former Boston Consulting Group colleague, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Thanks in large part to Bibi's intransigence and acceptance of low levels of violence into the inndefinite future, Romney has good reason to believe that "the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish." Benjamin Netanyahu's premiership makes peace in the Middle East virtually impossible. Netanyahu, after all, opposed the 1993 Oslo Accords, which he said were "against my principles and my conscience" and were based upon "an enormous lie." Bibi also fought against the Ehud Barak's proposals to Yassir Arafat during the Clinton administration and refused to support the 2008 offer his predecessor Ehud Olmert made to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Even Netanyahu's much-hyped 2009 Bar-Ilan speech represented little movement forward towards a two-state solution he has long opposed: Mr. Netanyahu made no mention of existing frameworks for negotiations, like the American-backed 2003 peace plan known as the road map. He did not address the geographical area a Palestinian state might cover, and he said that the Palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside Israel's borders, negating the Palestinian demand for a right of return for refugees of the 1948 war and for their millions of descendants. He insisted that Jerusalem remain united as the Israeli capital. The Palestinians demand the eastern part of the city as a future capital. As Bibi's late father Benzion described it, "He doesn't support [a Palestinian state]. He supports the sorts of conditions they [the Palestinians] will never accept." Of course, Mitt Romney was just fine with them. At least he was, until today."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349829477361</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 20:37:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349831356725-39</Id><Topic><Title>Fox must have missed this?</Title><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1349808995816</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 14:56:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So "still feeling the effects of that GLOBAL ECONOMIC MELTDOWN " caused by "BUSH"S GREAT RECESSION!!" is a downgrade from promise to fundametally transform this country?

UPDATE: 7:45 p.m. -- The Democratic National Committee posted video later on Tuesday of Romney saying during a February interview that he would cut Planned Parenthood funding, block foreign aid from going to abortions and appoint Supreme Court Justices to overturn Roe v. Wade. UPDATE: 7:50 p.m. -- Planned Parenthood issued a response to Romney's comments, saying he "is misleading the public about his intention to restrict safe and legal abortion." "Last week, Mitt Romney was dishonest about his tax plan and his Medicare plan, and today he’s being dishonest about his intention to end access to safe and legal abortion," Dawn Laguens, Planned Parenthood Action Fund executive vice president, said in a statement. "Mitt Romney has been crystal clear that if he’s elected President, he will work to overturn Roe v. Wade. Mitt Romney’s views on women’s health are far outside of the mainstream, and that’s why he’s trying to hide them in the last weeks until the election." UPDATE: 8:15 p.m. -- This story has been updated to include a comment from Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul. UPDATE: 8:50 p.m. -- The Obama campaign responded later Tuesday, asking whether Romney had lied to the Register about his plans. "It’s troubling that Mitt Romney is so willing to play politics with such important issues," Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a statement. "But we know the truth about where he stands on a woman’s right to choose – he’s said he’d be delighted to sign a bill banning all abortions, and called Roe v. Wade ‘one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history’ while pledging to appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn it. Women simply can’t trust him."

White House Spokesman Jay Carney, and any number of staffers and surrogates -- was 100% false. There were no protests, no benign crowds exploited by local militias, and nothing had anything to do with a video. Our Ambassador, another diplomat, and two Navy SEALs were murdered in a brutally efficient and coordinated terrorist attack. Period. End of story. In other words, just days after the president declared al-Qaeda all but obliterated at his convention in Charlotte, and because no one took direct threats and pleas for added security seriously, on the anniversary of September 11, four Americans were assassinated in Libya by al-Qaeda associates. And for days and days and days afterward, the Obama Administration covered this fact up with lies of omission, half-truths, double talk, and outright lies. By keeping our focus and anger on a completely fabricated fable about a stupid video and a "spontaneous" protest gone bad, the White House could pretend the lack of security or the lack of turning a pile of intelligence into something "actionable," wasn't their fault. What I would like to know is where was the evidence for this "spontaneous protest?" What was this nonsense based on? Because since day one, every piece of concrete evidence pointed to a coordinated terror attack. In fact, the only evidence I know of of a spontaneous protest gone bad was what our dishonest government was telling us. And they told us this all the way through September 19. When Ambassador Rice did the Sunday Show round-robin FOUR days after the attack, and told America… We do not-- we do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned. …she lied. During a White House briefing, when Jay Carney told this to the White House Press Corps a full SEVEN days after the attack…. All I can tell you is that based on the information that we had then and have now we do not yet have indication that it was pre-planned or pre-meditated. …he lied. If the corrupt media were to give this unraveling scandal a tenth of the attention it deserves, Obama's reelection chances would be non-existent. Libya isn't just a scandal about criminally lax security, it's also a cover up committed by a White House betting on the media to be a co-conspirator. And thus far, with rare exception, that's been a pretty safe bet. And if Obama does win reelection, that's when the media will finally stop protecting him and we can all expect his second term to be completely crippled by this scandal for years. You know, had Obama been half as concerned with the security of overseas assets in the form of personnel and intelligence as he is with securing more welfare for Big Bird, the world would look a whole lot different today. But Big Bird is Big Bird and Libya was just a "bump in the road."</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349836279315</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:31:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349837250349-42</Id><Title>SumBuddy get a doctor, JB's flipping out ...learn more...</Title><Msg>Gawd, he's nuttier than I've ever seen em.

Secretary of State Jon Husted asked the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether the state Legislature or federal courts should set Ohio election laws. Husted, a Republican, also asked the court to delay the lower court's decision while the Supreme Court decides whether to take the case. Husted said Friday's decision by the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals would affect how elections are run in all 50 states. The appeals court in Cincinnati affirmed a lower court ruling and returned discretion to set hours on the final three days to local boards of elections. "This ruling not only doesn't make legal sense, it doesn't make practical sense," Husted, a Republican, said in a statement. He said it opened up the chance for Ohio's 88 county boards of elections to set different rules, while at the same time ordering that all voters be treated the same. Husted said he will be consulting with those boards to craft a directive that sets uniform hours on the three disputed days in the event his appeal isn't successful. President Barack Obama's campaign and Democrats had sued Husted and Ohio's attorney general for cutting off early voting for most residents on the Friday evening before a Tuesday election. The law makes an exception for military personnel and Ohio voters living overseas. Bob Bauer, general counsel for Obama for America, said the campaign had no reason to believe that the state would find success at the Supreme Court level. "There is no justification for the state's arbitrary actions this year in trying to deny the vast majority of its voters access to open polling places for the last three days before the election," Bauer said in a statement. Before the changes to the Ohio law, local boards of elections previously set early voting hours on the three final days. And weekday hours and weekend voting varied among the state's counties. Democrats estimated in their lawsuit that 93,000 people voted during the final three-day window before the 2008 election. They argued everyone should have the chance to vote on those three days. They said eliminating the opportunity for most Ohio residents to vote in person on those days, while giving military or overseas voters the chance to do so, led to unequal treatment. The decision the 6th Circuit affirmed came from U.S. District Judge Peter Economus on Aug. 31. He said he expected Husted to direct all county elections boards to maintain a specific, consistent schedule on the three final days before Election Day. Attorneys for the state said many laws already grant military personnel special voting accommodations, such as requirements for states to send absentee ballots to them 45 days before the election. And they contend local boards also need those three days to prepare for the election. But Economus said the voters' right to cast ballots in person on those days outweighs the state's reasons for limiting that opportunity. The judge issued a preliminary injunction, concluding that the state's law was unconstitutional in changing the in-person early voting deadline and that the state was wrongly valuing certain votes above others. Husted's announcement that he would take the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court came on a day when Obama was campaigning in the state, timing a rally at the Ohio State University campus to the final day of voter registration. Obama's fellow Democrats criticized Husted for fostering voter confusion. State Sen. Nina Turner of Cleveland said Husted could set uniform statewide hours on the final three days before the election if that is his goal. Senate Democratic Leader Eric Kearney accused Husted of using delay tactics to impede voters' rights. "It is now clear that Secretary of State Jon Husted will stop at nothing to deny Ohioans full and equal access to the polls," he said.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349837991235</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:59:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349839324524-44</Id><Topic><Title>GOP continues assault on democracy</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349837991235</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:59:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Leading Voter Suppression Expert Calls Voter ID Laws ‘A Favor’ For Poor Americans By Adam Peck and Scott Keyes on Oct 9, 2012 at 1:30 pm DENVER, Colorado — During a panel on voter ID laws, the Heritage Foundation’s Hans von Spakovsky declared at the Colorado Conservative Political Action Conference that voters who are facing disenfranchisement should really be thankful for new, discriminatory voter ID laws being introduced by conservatives across the country: VON SPAKOVSKY: Getting the very few people who don’t have an ID an ID is very easy. And in fact, we should be happy that people have to get an id like that. Why? Because you cannot function in today’s society without an id. And anyone who doesn’t have one, we’re doing them a favor. We are helping them to get identification they will then need to do all kinds of things. Like if they want to apply for public systems or welfare, you need an ID. You want to do all kinds of other things, you need an ID. Watch it: Von Spakovsky’s condescending and offensive remarks about people on welfare aside, his comments on the number of people without government-issued identification are false. The non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University has published an exhaustive study which shows that 11 percent of all eligible voters nationally don’t have a government-issued photo id. That figure climbs dramatically for college students, seniors, minorities and low-income voters. Von Spakovsky has a long history of voter suppression dating back to his time as a George W. Bush appointee to the Federal Election Commission, where, according to the Washington Post, he used “every opportunity he had over four years in the Justice Department to make it difficult for voters — poor, minority and Democratic — to go to the polls.” Now from his perch at the far-right Heritage Foundation, he and fellow conservatives have spent the last few years promoting new voter ID laws in states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in an attempt to solve the country’s non-existent voter fraud problem. Since 2000, there has been about one case of voter impersonation per every 15 million votes cast, according to a report from ProPublica. That’s compared to an estimated 21 million eligible voters who don’t have a state-issued ID.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349839324524</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 23:22:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349840185302-45</Id><Topic><Title>Another Obama achievement</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1349738634573</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 19:23:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It sure as hell ain't Riverside.
