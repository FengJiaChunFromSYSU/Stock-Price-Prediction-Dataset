I have accounts at both places. Ameritade is loaded with gimmicry; if you don't believe me, just ask Ted .But in many important ways Etrade has a far superior platform. P.S. I thought the post about Reagan was spot on, but perhaps the school librarian will have more fire power at her disposal than the secret service does.</Msg><Username>symmetric_prime</Username><Timestamp>1357930161510</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 13:49:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357932741679-5</Id><Topic><Title>You will never guess who awarded father of the year...</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1357766157575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:15:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess Clinton is ignoring the historical record, or at least distorting it, because "he cares". Why does someone need a 30 round clip for a gun . . . 1. It's not a "clip" its a magazine. Only Carcano style feed weapons and Garands use "clips", along with a VERY few others. So you've already thoroughly demonstrated that the protagonist is ignorant on the subject of which he speaks, and therefore can't be considered an "authority" in the normal meaningful sense. 2. Most weapons in 5.56mm are designed to work with them just as most 7.62mm rifles are designed to work with 20 round magazines. 3. Because a weapon that keeps on firing is one you don't have to reload as frequently. You might ask why we don't just use muskets, and I'm all for that, when all the US Government issues its troops is muskets. 4. If they ban large capacity magazines, I just may go into business building semi-automatic belt fed guns instead. They do, after all, have a magazine capacity of zero. An M1919 or other belt fed weapon can fire forever without ever needing reloading in any classical sense . . . Just attach more ammo at the end. Remember, the United States of America is NOT the same thing as the Republic of the United States of America. We can do away with the federalist system at any time and still keep our Republic of Independent states. All we have to do is start using the Constitution again. Something which, of course, your masters in Washington will do all they can to avoid. And yes, your MASTERS, for if you make too much noise you'll find yourself like a certain Muslim cleric who rocked the boat and was put on a US hit list despite despite having NEVER committed a violent act. He was executed for transmitting IDEAS. Remember that the next time you express a public opinion critical of The Anointed One. Nixon was vilified for having a political enemies list, whereas Obama is given the nod in having a persona kill list of US citizens. Right now he's probably trying to make it easier by authorizing strikes WITHIN the United States and designating the Republican Party as a terrorist organization. Along with anyone else that speaks truth to power.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1357932741679</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 14:32:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357935386538-6</Id><Topic><Title>News Americans should know before they vote</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1352076948870</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 19:55:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can't really call it covert when Obama and his bar buddies said long ago that the answer to greenhouses gases is to make energy prices extremely high.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1357935386538</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:16:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357942795982-7</Id><Topic><Title>if you are a right wing</Title><Username>billietwinky</Username><Timestamp>1357940886505</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 16:48:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great post!

And I'm a libertarian, that makes me slightly less apt to be backing legislation taking people's rights away, which at this point seems to be the only differentiating element between the two primary parties being exactly whose rights they want to seize. The left is going after the "rich" (anyone actually paying taxes) and gun owners, and the right goes after abortionists and criminals. Nothing wrong with going after criminals, it's just that with mandatory minimums and aggravating charges, almost anything can be turned into a serious charge. The DC Attorney general recently let a liberal news commentator walk because his illegal constructive possession of a high capacity magazine, which for anyone else would have been a felony offense because "Influencing our judgment in this case, among other things, is our recognition that the intent of the temporary possession and short display of the magazine was to promote the First Amendment purpose of informing an ongoing public debate about firearms policy in the United States, especially while this subject was foremost in the minds of the public". Not a defense just anyone could use, and in fact by the plain word of the statute not a defense AT ALL. Hey though, it's not what you did, it's who you know that can make sure there are no charges. I can see why you support liberals, they tend to make themselves somehow protected classes to whom the laws the rest of us live with don't apply. If I'd been using a 30 round magazine as a prop in a discussion on 2nd Amendment rights in D.C. I'd have been bonded over for arraignment, and so would almost any of you, if you didn't have nice contacts with the Justice Department.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1357948409381</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 18:53:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357953791957-9</Id><Topic><Title>HEY JB!...Ain't Ya Skeerd?...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1351740131874</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:22:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I ain't jb, but I'm still LAUGING at you jerks. hahahahahahahaheheheheheeeee</Msg><Username>billietwinky</Username><Timestamp>1357953791957</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 20:23:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
