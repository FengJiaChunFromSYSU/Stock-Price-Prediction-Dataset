You can read what Rumsfeld himself said about this meeting, and learn what was publicly available and perfectly logical at the time. Saddam's nuclear reactor was destroyed by Israel in 1981. Reagan proudly called Israel's operation “a terrific piece of bombing". So, the close relationship of Jacques Chirac and Saddam doesn't bother you that much? It was Chirac who went out of his way to help Saddam to rebuild destroyed reactor. French PM called Saddam "my dear friend". Heard something about "oil for food" scandal? Russia and France - major beneficiaries. Switch to other conspiracy theory.

Average Bush Budget = income + 400 BILLION dollars. In other words the whole thing only cost one year of the money that your guy has been #$%$ away holding up companies like Solyndra, Golf-Kart companies that think they can make cars, and other dubious schemes. Consider the conundrum of Iraq. And the questionable reasoning that led to the conclusion. We had them under sanctions The sanctions weren't hurting anyone but the innocent We had to lift sanctions We couldn't lift sanctions because then Saddam would just start rearming THEREFORE Before lifting sanctions all traces of Saddam's power must be erased. Now I think the conclusion was wrong. I think we could have gotten Saddam just by destroying C&amp;C and other structures where he might be at any given time and tell the Iraqi's that we'd stop when they turned over himself and his brats. That'd have been my move. Bush however wanted boots on the ground largely because he believed we would be welcomed with open arms (ah what fools these Christians be). That, needless to say, was only going to happen if the open arms belonged to someone hoping to profit off our presence. So, that's just what we got, bunch of lickspittle cronies of expatriates who had few real contacts in Iraq stressing the ONE thing they thought we cared about (and we did, we couldn't take any chances that the CIA version of the NIA was correct), and it took two years after that before we could toss most of them aside for people who really could help, by which time we'd alienated them almost beyond level of recovery.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1365186238814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 14:23:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365186250239-26</Id><Title>Quality of the board???</Title><Msg>The CLOWN is now the authority of judgement of the members posting on this MB!

Hundreds of billions of dollars gone God alone knows where (and someone on Obama's staff probably has an idea) with literally nothing to show for it save a brief bump in economic conditions, just enough to get him re-elected. Though I must give him credit for REDUCING his deficit spending fairly consistently over his terms (with ONE minor exception). Here are some brief sample numbers . . . (snagged off a Federal Budget site) Recent US Federal Deficit Numbers Obama Deficits Bush Deficits FY 2013*: $901 billion FY 2009†: $1,413 billion FY 2012: $1,089 billion FY 2008: $459 billion FY 2011: $1,300 billion FY 2007: $161 billion FY 2010: $1,293 billion Although the federal deficit is the amount each year by which federal outlays in the federal budget exceed federal receipts, the gross federal debt increases each year by substantially more than the amount of the deficit each year. That is because a substantial amount of federal borrowing is not counted in the budget. Note: * Federal Deficit is budgeted. † Some people have emailed to insist that the FY 2009 deficit should be assigned to Obama as most all of it was additional spending requested by President Obama during the fiscal year. Good point.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1365188816230</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 15:06:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365190730818-33</Id><Topic><Title>bush &amp; crew spent trillions getting rid of imaginary WMD in Iraq &amp; never mind about the real ones in N Korea</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365081932850</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 09:25:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>another poster that seems to have no clue how severe -8.9% gdp is. any idea how much of the bailout money has been returned? how much is expected to be returned? and yes, great recession\depressions are very expensive for govts to endure.

Last month, 81,804 workers left the workforce to join the Social Security Disability Insurance program. So far this year, nearly a quarter million workers have joined the program. Over the past four years, 4 million left the workforce to go on disability. Even after accounting for those who dropped out of the program because of death or retirement, the ranks of the disabled have shot up more than 1.4 million under Obama. Today, the ranks of the disabled number 8.8 million, and when you add in children and spouses, the number climbs to 10.9 million.
