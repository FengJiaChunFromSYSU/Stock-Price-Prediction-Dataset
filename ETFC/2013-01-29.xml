Available-for-sale, trading &amp; held to maturity securities of about $29 bill... per the last 10k... the holdings consist mainly of gov’t agency debt... given lower-of-cost gaap accounting... and the collapse in interest rates... the market value is probably much higher depending on maturity length... here’s the nugget... the avg effective yield on these holdings is about 2.85%... then $10.1 bill in loans receivable - yielding about 4.7%... Margin receivables of $5.8 bill - yielding around 4%... vs. “Sweep deposits” - which is the #1 class of deposits - yielding less than one-tenth of 1%... bottom line... some things are goin right... i believe E*trade will become very profitable in the following quarters... &amp; yes... will start paying a dividend like they discussed on the last confer call in 1Q14.</Msg><Username>lucky_lenny_1964</Username><Timestamp>1359458952030</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 06:29:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359459885320-2</Id><Topic><Title>Disarm the mentally ill</Title><Username>call_your_mommee</Username><Timestamp>1359425381967</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 21:09:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Offer them same-sex marriage licenses.

That means the 40% rate does apply and for Etrade to have 300mil in earnings annually, they would need to do around 500mil in net earnings before taxes. That would come out to $1 per share and a 15 multiple would give you a $15 share price. That seems like quite a ways off to me, considering they just came off an annual loss of 113mil for 2012. Seems to me like they need to walk before they run here. $50 is really simply absurd.</Msg><Username>billwilliselkins</Username><Timestamp>1359473211835</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 10:26:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359474154457-5</Id><Topic><Title>dividend from e*trade</Title><Username>lucky_lenny_1964</Username><Timestamp>1359458952030</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 06:29:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the dividend was between the two E*Trade entities not to the actual shareholders.

I've got shares up to over 3 years old, maybe 4, but I'm not itching to sell them off at the first hint of a buyout. Aren't you interested in what terms might be acceptable? IF there is a buyout isn't as important as the details. As things stand now I really don't think a buyout would be in the long term interest of the company unless they're completely bearish on the economy.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1359487528620</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 14:25:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359490008638-11</Id><Topic><Title>Disarm the mentally ill</Title><Username>call_your_mommee</Username><Timestamp>1359425381967</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 21:09:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You wouldn't be suggesting using this devise on a differant male apendature would you?</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1359490008638</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 15:06:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359491534891-12</Id><Title>24 million latinos were eligible to vote in 2012</Title><Msg>So the logic of this immirgration policy is that we make more latinos eligible to vote so instead of having 71% of 24 million eligable voters, we can have 71% of 30 million latinos to vote Democratic.

The sad truth is that almost 46% of illegals are on some kind of government assistance, so lets bring in their poor and uneducated family members and put them on the dole...that way we can increase the dependent class to continue to vote for free stuff....
