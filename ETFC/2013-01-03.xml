So, you just proved yourself wrong. Obligation to pay off $100 of debt doesn't automatically authorize you to borrow a cent more. Future borrowing is not current. Can't see the difference, idiot? Demand your bank to give you anther loan since you already holding one. See if they will tell you they need authorization. US budget doesn't authorize defense only, it is a package. Responsible thing to do is to issue balanced budget. The House did that in 2000. Since than it lost the track. But worse than that, we didn't even have authorized budget for past 4 years. And producing budget is government's constitutional obligation. Whose fault is that? House's moral oligation is to produce balanced budget. It didn't for decades. This is why there is additional vote to authorize debt ceiling for rmore spending. Now I am asking you again. When Obama was right? When he voted against debt ceiling as Senator, or today demanding spending without limit?</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1357236996966</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 13:16:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357237042711-5</Id><Title>Anyone noticing BOSC reversal pattern?</Title><Msg>BOSC has a very small float and has some short term catalysts.

BTW, the so called WS experts sure had it right when the S&amp;P dropped to 666 in 2007 and sent us into a mini depression and caused the biggest bailout in history. The FED balance sheet is now in the trillions trying to keep the WS bubble going while along you have 47 million people on food stamps...which certanily does not seem to be improving "our real lives".</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1357238717745</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 13:45:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357239672900-8</Id><Title>Time to ban hammers and clubs</Title><Msg>For people of color it's much harder to use hammers in drive by gang murders. More People Killed with Hammers, Clubs Each Year Than Rifles According to the FBI annual crime statistics, the number of murders committed annually with hammers and clubs far outnumbers the number of murders committed with a rifle. This is an interesting fact, particularly amid the Democrats' feverish push to ban many different rifles, ostensibly to keep us safe of course. However, it appears the zeal of Sens. like Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) is misdirected. For in looking at the FBI numbers from 2005 to 2011, the number of murders by hammers and clubs consistently exceeds the number of murders committed with a rifle.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1357239672900</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:01:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357241396416-9</Id><Topic><Title>tea party types should read the USA constitution</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1357139443051</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 10:10:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOP doesn't vote against its own budget which isn't in effect.

Borrow so much that you can't pay back? And let China to dictate world order? Right, Communists know better. I can understand argument that raising debt ceiling to $9.5T may be considered unpatriotic. It doesn't make sense how $7T later it is right thing to do. The president didn't present to me a single convincing argument for changing his position 180. Does it mean the larger debt the better? Please, you held Mitt responsible for all kinds of inconsistencies. But Obama is all above that. See, as long as Obama is president he is beyond criticism, not just that, he is above the law too.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1357243786144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 15:09:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357244105931-11</Id><Topic><Title>The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law, including .........get it doofuses? including</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1357242661030</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 14:51:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is about current debt validity.
