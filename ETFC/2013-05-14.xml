Voters trust Hillary Clinton over Congressional Republicans on the issue of Benghazi by a 49/39 margin and Clinton's +8 net favorability rating at 52/44 is identical to what it was on our last national poll in late March. Meanwhile Congressional Republicans remain very unpopular with a 36/57 favorability rating. Voters think Congress should be more focused on other major issues right now rather than Benghazi. By a 56/38 margin they say passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill is more important than continuing to focus on Benghazi, and by a 52/43 spread they think passing a bill requiring background checks for all gun sales should be a higher priority. While voters overall may think Congress' focus should be elsewhere there's no doubt about how mad Republicans are about Benghazi. 41% say they consider this to be the biggest political scandal in American history to only 43% who disagree with that sentiment. Only 10% of Democrats and 20% of independents share that feeling. Republicans think by a 74/19 margin than Benghazi is a worse political scandal than Watergate, by a 74/12 margin that it's worse than Teapot Dome, and by a 70/20 margin that it's worse than Iran Contra. One interesting thing about the voters who think Benghazi is the biggest political scandal in American history is that 39% of them don't actually know where it is. 10% think it's in Egypt, 9% in Iran, 6% in Cuba, 5% in Syria, 4% in Iraq, and 1% each in North Korea and Liberia with 4% not willing to venture a guess. At any rate what we're finding about last week's Benghazi focus so far is that Republicans couldn't be much madder about it, voters overall think Congress should be focused on other key issues, and Hillary Clinton's poll numbers aren't declining on account of it.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1368560021392</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 15:33:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368560213623-38</Id><Topic><Title>Voters trust Clinton over GOP on Benghazi</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1368560021392</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 15:33:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"10% think it's in Egypt, 9% in Iran, 6% in Cuba, 5% in Syria, 4% in Iraq, and 1% each in North Korea and Liberia with 4% not willing to venture a guess."

That's the interesting part about discussions like this on an equity issue over time, and material circumstances change. I even sold my last 500 shares of temporary position and turned right around and bought $10 LEAPS with them. I can't hold the margin for that long but I'm willing to hold a cash position on the options and margin on the stock getting my net margin down while not increasing my purchasing power and "leading me into temptation" so to speak. Got another $10k or so worth of a penny stock for much the same reason. Not marginable so I'm not tempted to borrow against the principle (not that anyone sane borrows against a speculative stock with a beta of 2.2) There are lots of winners, and lots of losers, out there in the investing world. The trick isn't separating the winners for the losers, that's easy. The trick is picking the undervalued winners right before it becomes apparently to the rest of the market as well that they represent an undervalued winner. We have one here with eTrade, but again, the question is, when will the REST of the market realize it? This is the first time the stock has strayed out of my "accumulate" frame in oh, weeks at least, lets just hope it stays there and the frame moves with the earnings and value such that it catches up a tad.

WASHINGTON — The federal deficit is shrinking more quickly than expected, and the government's long-term debt has largely stabilized for the next decade, the Congressional Budget Office said Tuesday in a report that could strengthen the Obama administration's hand in the budget battles with congressional Republicans. The budget office continues to say the federal government faces a long-range budget problem — mostly caused by the costs of an aging population — but its new forecast pushes the crunch point for that problem off into a considerably more distant future: well after the 2020 presidential election. The deficit projection for this year — $642 billion — is almost 25% less than the deficit the budget office had forecast as recently as February. At the new level, the annual deficit would be back to where it was before President Obama took office. It would continue to fall for the rest of Obama's tenure, the budget office now projects. By contrast, the deficit for fiscal year 2012 came in at just over $1 trillion.</Msg><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1368589237736</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 23:40:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
