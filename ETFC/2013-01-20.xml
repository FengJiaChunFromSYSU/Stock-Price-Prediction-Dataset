His biggest accomplishment so far is, that he generated a large "REVENUE" through guns and ammo sales!

Tomorrow is an other bad TV day on the news channels carrying, I am sure, the pompous #$%$ celebration of spending more millions of the tax payer money! Why all this security, N.Korea, Venezuela, Cuba, Iran, Russia and the terrorists are all his friends now??? (Even Somalia is now a recognized government) Ahhh - there could be a crazy republican try to blow him up! Why couldn't our weather arrive a day earlier - a little 20F with a zero wind chill would help the crowd "cheer up"! (Better yet, like -9F for a high @ Fargo) All this, while people need food, sleep in the streets and I am NOT watching four FAT #$%$ES (oops - first azzes) parading around WDC! Happy #$%$ watching!

To my knowledge WF doesn't have an online brokerage. Obviously ETFC is a cyclical business which is one of the reasons they leveraged up and bought all those mortgages. The synergy with Wells would be significant as ETrade would be an amazing lead generator clients to the other business such as credit card, banking, wealth advisory, mortgage, etc. Finally as the largest mortgage provider in the country Wells is naturally positioned to take over the mortgage portfolio including the servicing rights from PNC. An amazing amount of synergy.</Msg><Username>mr_brightside_xy</Username><Timestamp>1358741679815</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 23:14:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358742095764-7</Id><Title>How go get rid of political spam/off topic garbage posts</Title><Msg>This board is almost worthless with all the political discussion and trash talk. If you are here for E*Trade discussion (what a concept) use the "ignore" user feature on the off topic posters. It took about five minutes to clear the users and their threads off the first page of messages. Long and strong on ETFC. Be all means if you're a pessimist on the company lets hear the reasoned details.</Msg><Username>mr_brightside_xy</Username><Timestamp>1358742095764</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 23:21:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
