So, what the Court was doing was invalidating California’s choice, and that’s exactly what the courts are supposed to do under the 14th Amendment.” Boies said that the 14th Amendment was passed to protect the rights of citizens to be free from discrimination. He said that a legal blitz will begin in all 50 states to assert that the Court declared that all gay marriage bans or anti-gay marriage laws are unconstitutional. “It’s terribly important that we extend the promise of equality that the Supreme Court and the district articulated in the DOMA case and in the Perry case to all Americans in all 50 states,” Boies concluded."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372697010014</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 12:43:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372697105431-29</Id><Topic><Title>Spank her for Jesus</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1372647412722</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 22:56:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Crackers are moving beyond just thumping bibles!</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372697105431</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 12:45:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372698451713-30</Id><Title>Crackers hiding behind kids</Title><Msg>"Social conservatives came out in full force on NBC’s Meet The Press on the Sunday after the Supreme Court struck down the Defense of Marriage Act. Former Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) of the Heritage Foundation and Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-KS) both claimed the court’s decision to recognize same-sex marriages sacrificed children’s wellbeing — only to have their arguments promptly slapped down by MSNBC hosts Rachel Maddow and David Gregory. DeMint said the court had privileged “the desires of adults” over “the best environment for children,” arguing that heterosexual marriage is “the environment where children can thrive and succeed.” Maddow immediately pointed out that this argument ignores the children of same-sex couples, who have up til now been treated as second-class citizens under the law: Justice Kennedy addressed that issue specifically in his ruling. He says that by denying marriage rights to same-sex couples who have kids, you’re humiliating and demeaning those kids. By denying their families equal protection under the law by the parents who are raising them and who love them and who make their family. So we can put it in the interests of children, but I think that cuts both ways. And the ruling cuts against that argument. I mean, gay people exist. There’s nothing we can do in public policy can do to make more of us exist or less of us exist. And you guys for a generation have argued that public policy ought to demean gay people as a way of expressing disapproval of the fact that we exist. But you don’t make any less of us exist, you are just arguing for more discrimination. And more discrimination doesn’t make straight people’s lives any better."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372698451713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:07:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372698538984-31</Id><Topic><Title>Crackers hiding behind kids</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372698451713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:07:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Later in the program, Huelskamp tried to justify his introduction of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage by touting debunked research that supposedly shows heterosexual parents are better for kids. Gregory challenged the congressman, insisting that he admit the research is bogus: HUELSKAMP: As Senator DeMint did note, the research is very clear that the ideal way of raising our children should be the issue here, and that’s what we need to focus on in this debate. GREGORY: Wait, but Justice Kennedy speaks to this. There’s also research that indicates that…you know, everyone talks about the interests of children. Children tend to prosper in homes where there is a loving marriage. There is really not evidence to suggest that if you are a same-sex couple or a heterosexual couple that it makes one difference one way or the other. HUELSKAMP: Well actually the research does not show that, actually the research is very clear as we have indicated here, but – GREGORY: No, no. Everybody throws that out, but the research actually shows that in broken homes, it hurts the children. Which I think most people would say that would be true of same-sex couples or heterosexual couples. We don’t really know, do we? But we do have a sense that loving marriages provide a good family life for children, right? Huelskamp ducked the debunk and again claimed that “the court decided the desires of adults should trump the needs of children.” Nevertheless, Gregory is correct that the research cited by marriage equality opponents actually has nothing to do with same-sex couples. In fact, the largest study of families with same-sex parents recently concluded these children are not only thriving, but even beat the national average for overall health and family cohesion."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372698538984</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:08:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372699531406-32</Id><Topic><Title>Crackers hiding behind kids</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372698451713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:07:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Research isn't needed, just common sense.

Sure, they MIGHT be justified in cities that totally lack public transportation systems, but in the end the public transportation systems are significantly cheaper, and create less pollutants to make and install.

Given we've been working on room temperature superconductors since I was a kid, and the ONLY progress is a unit that works at Liquid Nitrogen temperatures rather than Liquid Helium or Hydrogen, I'd say we have a VERY long way to go.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1372701931486</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 14:05:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372702289873-39</Id><Topic><Title>Crackers hiding behind kids</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372698451713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:07:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you have unwanted kids I'm SURE you could find someone to take them off your hands, provided that are relatively free of obvious defect or such, that would be NO problem.

General gay "relationships" HAVE been studied and their duration (except for Lesbian couples committed to kids) have more often than not been extremely short provided the relationship was supposed to be exclusive, (men cheat, and two men, that's almost a guarantee of cheating), and children often find themselves caught between dad, dad, and one of the dad's boyfriends. And those gay couples that HAVE been allowed to adopt have been VERY VERY carefully screened, so I'm going to take that selective study with a HUGE grain of salt. If there's ANY advantage in a gay marriage its that they don't have kids "by accident". Instead of comparing them to all hetero couples, why don't you compared them PURELY to ADOPTIVE heterosexual couples. But then, if you do that, the numbers no longer favor gay marriage, probably why that studies authors likely never even tried to make that comparison.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1372702648296</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 14:17:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372704053559-42</Id><Topic><Title>Crackers hiding behind kids</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372698451713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 13:07:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're just another cracker making stuff up as you try to justify your prejudices.

As for Pinto Bombs, a simple self sealing fuel tank like those used on modern aircraft would solve most of those problems. An electric car on the other hand, while normally NOT a threat, can become one with a VERY small change in charging protocol. I use Lithium Polymer batteries (rather than Li-Ion) and they are even MORE touchy, in fact I have to charge them in my fireplace with the grate closed JUST in case they overheat and decide to catch fire, or explode. Each cell in the battery (each has 3 cells) yields about 68 joules of energy instantaneously if there is a short circuit and the battery is fully exposed. If they used those in Cell Phones that'd mean about every time someone's battery got wet, if close to capacity, would feel the experience of the stability of most modern Lithium Polymer based batteries. Fortunately L-Ion batteries are MUCH safer, but right now they represent the limits of electrical energy storage without taking HUGE risks about electrical storage stability. And still, they're not enough to hold a decent charge for an automobile without carrying AT LEAST a quarter TON of batteries in your car. Great for cities they are, as long as the city gets its power from Hydro, Solar, Nuclear, or other non-polluting renewable sources. Not so great if even the battery plant is powered by coal or natural gas or just about anything else. Then the net amount of carbon produced over the life of the batteries (about 3 years with steadily decreasing max charge) by a regular economy car is LESS than that JUST from manufacturing the batteries.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1372708071887</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 15:47:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372708677934-50</Id><Topic><Title>Over a Million Jeeps could Catch Fire</Title><Username>methuserlaw</Username><Timestamp>1372597900834</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 09:11:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The cost of global warming can be ameliorated simply by planting more trees, and insuring they DON'T get burned for fuel. That's one reason I bought 43 wooded acres in an area of Texas that's largely farms and ranches, my land, for one, will NEVER be clear cut for crops, and with some exceptions the wood I produce won't be burned. The chips and cuttings will be mulched for planting or put in a vat for ferment and produce wood alcohol as a fuel additive, assuming Fir trees can produce enough to make it worth while. How to address global warming is largely up to the individual. I try to keep my footprint as small as I can, but I have to say that of all the "Oh My God, Global Warming!" I'm probably one of the few here that's done what was suggested years ago, for everyone to buy 40+ acres of land and plant trees . . . That alone would sequester more carbon than any of us produce. So, where are YOUR carbon sequestration plans? Most liberals you see only apply their plans at OTHER people's cost, not their own, but I put a fair chunk of change into ELIMINATING my carbon footprint as much as possible. How many anti-global warming chumps can say the same? Because until they can they should keep their lower and upper jaws locked tight when it comes to discussing the subject. Like Al Gore flying around in a private jet scolding other people about their energy use and the resulting environmental impact.
