The essence of bigotry is treating people unequally -- giving rights, privileges, and respect to one group that are denied to another group. The people with the rights and privileges pretty quickly get used to having those advantages. After a while the inequality becomes tradition, the way things have always been. As long as things stay that way, the world seems familiar, predictable, and therefore safe. But as soon as there is any substantial step toward more equality -- whether it’s women getting the vote, blacks going to school with whites, undocumented immigrants getting a path to citizenship, same sex couples getting married, or whatever -- conservatives think, “Hey, if this can happen, who knows what can happen next?” As Justice Alito wrote, “No one ... can predict with any certainty what the long-term ramifications” will be. So the right-wing justices did get something right. As they made clear, resisting same-sex marriage is merely the most current example of what’s always the really crucial issue for conservatives: continuity versus change; the familiar, which is predictable, stable, and safe (or so they want to believe), versus the unfamiliar, which feels so unpredictable, unstable, and scary. The essence of their arguments, whatever the issue, always comes back to conserving the old so we can avoid the uncertainty of the new."

The court's action Thursday was a predictable result of its major ruling two days earlier that effectively ended the federal government's strict supervision of elections in Texas and other states with a history of discrimination in voting. The justices ordered lower courts to reconsider in light of Tuesday's ruling. In both the voter ID and redistricting cases, the court stopped the state from putting in place the laws under the advance approval requirement of the Voting Rights Act. The court has said that part of the law cannot be used unless Congress develops a new formula for determining which states and localities should be covered.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1372344690012</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 10:51:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372344800498-22</Id><Topic><Title>Paula Deen, Wingnut Racist Goes Down</Title><Username>methuserlaw</Username><Timestamp>1372220524923</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:22:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK now we're entering the realm of the weird . . . so what makes this element of her deposition even germane to whatever case the person might have against her, or are you telling me her career was destroyed during a fishing expedition (unsupported line of questioning) by a stupid lawyer?

Rick Perry is set to address a national convention of anti-abortion activists Thursday little more than a day after a special legislative session failed to approve sweeping restrictions to make abortion all but impossible for many women in the state. The Republican leader has called a second special legislative session beginning July 1, allowing the GOP-controlled Texas statehouse another crack at passing the restrictions that opponents say could close nearly all abortion clinics in the country's second-largest state. Perry's announcement came hours after the much-watched proposal failed in the face of a Democratic filibuster in the Senate that turned chaotic when Republicans used parliamentary rules to cut it short. The hubbub from jeering opponents of the proposal in the public gallery became so deafening that it halted all action on the floor. Perry, who has said he'd like to make abortion at any stage of pregnancy a thing of the past in Texas, called the special session after lawmakers finished the regular session May 27. He didn't add the abortion measure to the issues to be discussed until late in the session. The omnibus abortion measure passed the Texas House after nearly an entire night of heated debate Sunday, but the effort to get Senate approval before the session ended at 11:59 p.m. Tuesday failed. Democratic Sen. Wendy Davis of Fort Worth staged a filibuster for more than 11 hours. But when Republicans were able to silence her on a technicality minutes before midnight, hundreds of protesters raised such a ruckus that lawmakers were unable to hold a final vote until after the clock had run out. The spectacle put the spotlight on Perry as he prepared to open the 43rd annual National Right to Life Convention in Dallas on Thursday. His decision to call another special session gives lawmakers 30 more days to push the abortion restrictions - perhaps enough time to withstand Democratic stalling tactics.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1372345658510</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 11:07:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372346281457-25</Id><Topic><Title>Paula Deen, Wingnut Racist Goes Down</Title><Username>methuserlaw</Username><Timestamp>1372220524923</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:22:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the thing is that Deen demonstrated a deep down racism.....so deep that it just seems like the most natural thing in the world to dream of old Dixie plantation weddings and being served by slaves....Similar to how it never occurred to Perry in texas to remove the Camp N@@@@@head sign from the family retreat until some time recently...... or how many southerners think nothing of flying the stars and bars, the symbol of the south's rebellion and attempt preserve slavery.

This has been my long-standing position, and it is not being reviewed or reconsidered." DOMA passed 85 against 14 in the Senate and 342 against 67 in the House. Whole lot of "bigots" over there. Including US President who couldn't even say a word against pure 'bigotry" and opposed to gay marriage. Clinton - "bigot"! Obama - "bigot", but he "evolves'.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1372354820664</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:40:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372354964777-35</Id><Topic><Title>Paula Deen, Wingnut Racist Goes Down</Title><Username>methuserlaw</Username><Timestamp>1372220524923</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:22:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>True, but in someone from her background, and that generation, I'm not terribly surprised. My father's contemporaries thought nothing of race jokes, and used the n word routinely. It wasn't until the late baby boom generation (my crowd) that some awareness existed that these jokes were terribly offensive to some people, and even that didn't keep them from appearing on late night television until, oh, a few years ago. The point is OF COURSE someone from then and there grew up around and was constantly exposed to those sorts of views, so its NORMAL that in SOME time in her life she both used the N word, and potentially MEANT it. But then again at sometime in our lives we're about as functional, and useful, as tubeworms. We do outgrow it.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1372354964777</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:42:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372355154272-36</Id><Topic><Title>GOP won't get out of your bedrooms</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1372254757336</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:52:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're right about the second point, if totally off base on the first.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1372355154272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:45:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372358745863-37</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts Are Furiously</Title><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1372353727131</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 13:22:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you really think the idiots posting here are smart enough to even know how to take a short position?
