Screeners in Cincinnati, where all applications for tax-exemptions are processed, used the list to identify sensitive or complex cases that should be sent to specialists in Cincinnati and Washington. "And I was aware of, you know, other cases at that time that were working their way through the D.C. office that involved proposed denials of exemption to liberal organizations that supported the Democratic Party. So I had no indication that we were not being balanced in what we were doing," Paz said. "Since the first case that came up to Washington happened to have that name, it appeared to me that that's what they were calling it that as a shorthand, because the first case had been that," said Holly Paz, the Internal Revenue Service's director of rulings and agreements. She said "tea party" could mean any political group, just like "Coke" is used as a generic term for soda, or people refer to tissues as "Kleenex."</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1371476758029</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:45:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371476837094-6</Id><Topic><Title>NEARLY HALF OF ALL AMERICANS SAY SURVEILLANCE ARE ACCEPTABLE WITHIN LIMITS</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1371015094463</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 01:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lucky - I do "get the picture" . I get a lot of pictures. I am aware that the patriot act is not new and was in use during Bush era as much as it is in Obama's. Is this really how low we fell that BUSH is now our moral compass? I though Obama had bit higher standards. No? I am not saying anyone is abusing the system - I'm saying it CAN be abused. Historically - if the possibility exists - someone eventually does. Also, you are wrong on that warrant tidbit. If they flag ANYTHING as a potential terrorist act - they can do pretty much whatever they want under the Patriot Act. They can even put you in jail for a decade or more without ever charging you, or send a drone or team of Navy Seals to take you out. All without due process and all in the name of "greater good". If I recall correctly - Obama was going to "clean it up" ....... but it's hard to let go of THAT kind of power....</Msg><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1371476837094</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 09:47:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371488667833-7</Id><Topic><Title>Read what Cheney said on FauxNews</Title><Username>hunterspoint</Username><Timestamp>1371427513925</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 20:05:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hunterspoint, As much as I hate to admit it the old chicken hawk Cheney is absolutelty correct in regard to the surveillance programs and this guy Eward Snowden.

A majority of respondents to the CNN/ORC International poll, 52 percent, said they think Obama is a strong and decisive leader, but that figure is also down — 6 percentage points from May. Results of the poll — coming as Obama’s administration is reacting to reports of the NSA surveillance program, the IRS scrutinizing conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status, the deadly terror attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Libya and the Justice Department’s collection of journalists’ phone records as part of a government investigation into classified leaks — indicate nearly half of the U.S. public said they don’t believe the president is honest. His approval rating was down from 53 percent in mid-May. Fifty-four percent of respondents said they disapprove of how Obama’s handling his job, up 9 percentage points from last month, the first time since November 2011 that a majority of Americans have had a negative view of the president, CNN said. The number of Americans who said they think Obama is honest dropped 9 percentage points to 49 percent. Fifty-seven percent of those questioned disagreed with the president’s views on the size and power of the federal government and 53 percent said he cannot manage the government effectively. Results are based on nationwide phone interviews with 1,014 adults conducted Tuesday through Thursday. The margin of error is 3 percentage points.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1371498907330</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 15:55:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371499370038-18</Id><Topic><Title>etfc posts</Title><Username>grandpa_6</Username><Timestamp>1371491291407</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 13:48:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only an idiot would do that . . . I've corrected some misapprehensions, but there is no way political discussion on a stock board is going to change anyone's mind about anything. For the vast bulk of the population only bitter experience will make those kinds of changes. For the few that still read anything with an actual bound spine, wisdom can be distilled, but no matter how you fill yourself, until you actually take the time to digest the contents, even the classics are worthless. During the fall of the Roman Empire one Emperor tried to reform the system and almost succeeded, however not even two generations of relative prosperity and his repeated warnings kept the Romans from making future bad choices, and so almost two millennia later I'd have to have a serious case of hubris to think I could do any better, even if I wanted to try. Nothing I do in the world will matter except to me in the short term. In the long term nothing ANYONE does on this earth will matter unless and until we've learned to survive beyond it. If I have a political agenda, I'd have to say it would be the survival of the species, and the maintenance of individual freedoms, in that order, and that's about it.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1371499370038</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 16:02:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371499958489-19</Id><Topic><Title>NEARLY HALF OF ALL AMERICANS SAY SURVEILLANCE ARE ACCEPTABLE WITHIN LIMITS</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1371015094463</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 01:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Have not much to disagree here. Except Bush never been and isn't moral compass for anything this administration was and is doing. Moral compass is never the case for Obama. It is all pure politics. Note, when Obama was challenged by some in the media on something perceived by the public negatively, like: 1. Rescuing AIG and banks; 2. Fast and Furious; 3. Patriot Act; For all the above Obama referred to Bush like a kindergarten kid when caught doing something wrong. The media helped a lot too. Even IRS case not without attempt to blame it on Bush(his appointee). In case of Fast and Furious he even went as far as openly lying on Univision that it was initiated under Bush. “Well, first of all, I think it’s important to understand that the Fast and Furious program was a field-initiated program, begun under the previous administration”. Although, utterly dishonest, all those finger pointing did work for long time. And I would deeply suspect what’s bothering you more than anything, is that Obama continued much criticized, beaten up Bush’s program even on larger scale. Moral compass and US Constitution is least concern of yours.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1371499958489</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 16:12:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371502224032-20</Id><Topic><Title>etfc posts</Title><Username>grandpa_6</Username><Timestamp>1371491291407</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 13:48:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unfortunately that doesn't always work, there are still some glitches in the system (e.g. ignored users authoring topics).</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1371502224032</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 16:50:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371503077989-21</Id><Topic><Title>etfc posts</Title><Username>grandpa_6</Username><Timestamp>1371491291407</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 13:48:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Short answer, nothing will help.
