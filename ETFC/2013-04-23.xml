The senators cite their support for liberty and limited government and say same-sex couples deserve the same marriage rights as anyone. While the GOP caucus only holds five of the Senate's 38 seats, its support is another indication of the growing support for gay marriage in Rhode Island, now the only New England state that doesn't allow gay marriage.

Murder rates in most of the Muslim world are very low compared to the United States. As for political violence, people of Christian heritage in the twentieth century polished off tens of millions of people in the two world wars and colonial repression. This massive carnage did not occur because European Christians are worse than or different from other human beings, but because they were the first to industrialize war and pursue a national model. Sometimes it is argued that they did not act in the name of religion but of nationalism. But, really, how naive. Religion and nationalism are closely intertwined. The British monarch is the head of the Church of England, and that still meant something in the first half of the twentieth century, at least. The Swedish church is a national church. Spain? Was it really unconnected to Catholicism? Did the Church and Francisco Franco’s feelings toward it play no role in the Civil War? And what’s sauce for the goose: much Muslim violence is driven by forms of modern nationalism, too. I don’t figure that Muslims killed more than a 2 million people or so in political violence in the entire twentieth century, and that mainly in the Iran-Iraq War 1980-1988 and the Soviet and post-Soviet wars in Afghanistan, for which Europeans bear some blame. Compare that to the Christian European tally of, oh, lets say 100 million (16 million in WW I, 60 million in WW II– though some of those were attributable to Buddhists in Asia– and millions more in colonial wars.).......

Get used to it, Republicans finally will sling MUD - while Obimbocrats were already slinging SH%%! (Nice to see that more and more democrats go along with Republicans because they see where Obimborama is leading to) Yep, don't wonder - it will end with the Obimborama European Model - a riot per week, latest in France with their gay issues, preceeded by Greece, Italy, Spain..........! (A debt that can't be repaid, a $ which is worthless and unemployment of +20%!) Hope that answers your question!

Our record system SUCKS and the government is not about to go back to basics and straighten out/update records - instead we passing NEW laws, which tumble over each other and NOTHING gets done/enforced! If we could go back to common sense and leave the politics/photo-ops out - maybe we actually could get something done! Last on this Boston Terrorist - why doesn't he get charged with treason??? He had to take the same oath I did when becoming a citizen, which he violated! Strip him of his citizen ship and then try him as a combatent! Enough said!

Bush will return to the spotlight this week for the dedication of his presidential library, an event likely to trigger fresh public debate about his eight fateful years in office. But he reemerges with a better public image than when he left Washington more than four years ago. Since then, Bush has absented himself from both policy disputes and political battles. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll suggests that the passage of time and Bush’s relative invisibility have been beneficial to a chief executive who left office surrounded by controversy. Days before his second term ended in 2009, Bush’s approval rating among all adults was 33 percent positive and 66 percent negative. The new poll found 47 percent saying they approve and 50 percent saying they disapprove. Among registered voters, his approval rating today is equal to President Obama’s, at 47 percent, according to the latest Post-ABC surveys.
