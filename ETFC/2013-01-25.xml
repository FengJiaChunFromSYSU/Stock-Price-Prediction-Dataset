They're in the black in actuality, they pay their debts, and much of this "provisioning money" they'll likely end up keeping. On top of which with Obama re-elected we can expect many of the loan portfolio come back to life at reduced rates that will at least be paid. Add a slow but steady economic recovery and I don't see what this isn't a bigtime longterm hold. Ask me they're finding every single loss or provisioning statute they can find and are cramming in the tax credits and burying cash as fast as they can. That's the way I'd be playing this economy with those kind of assets to protect. With MY kind of assets to protect I can afford to take on higher risk with the expectation of higher reward, one reason this property is so incredibly attractive, because if we DO tumble into a depression, then this stock is belly button lint.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1359120501382</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 08:28:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359121398158-6</Id><Topic><Title>Earnings in line...bullish going forward</Title><Username>headtoo</Username><Timestamp>1359104090721</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 03:54:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think this is the bottom for this stock, writing off the trash and beefing up the balance sheet</Msg><Username>lawstuff22</Username><Timestamp>1359121398158</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 08:43:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359124751720-7</Id><Topic><Title>Earnings in line...bullish going forward</Title><Username>headtoo</Username><Timestamp>1359104090721</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 03:54:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>buyers are coming</Msg><Username>lawstuff22</Username><Timestamp>1359124751720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:39:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359125100787-8</Id><Topic><Title>Earnings in line...bullish going forward</Title><Username>headtoo</Username><Timestamp>1359104090721</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 03:54:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree that it is a good question and your point about deleveraging further is certainly valid but I would gladly give up the 2.5 cents a quarter so they can focus on becoming a better brokerage firm.

Obviously one always prefers to see executives buying and it indicates the shares aren't terribly cheap but what if they are just slightly below fair value? Would you tie up your net worth in your employer in that situation? I wouldn't as the risks are just too great and I know that the experts would say don't do it even if the shares were cheap. Also, the fact is that it is easy to get a distorted view when you are inside a company as you are just so focused on dealing with the problems of your own area due to time pressure as well as the fact that we are a society whose wealth is largely the result of combining the efforts of large numbers of people who have specialized in one little area, not broad high level review. So it ain't cheap but at least it isn't expensive. What I think anyway.</Msg><Username>cohsgrad</Username><Timestamp>1359129143652</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 10:52:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359130288253-15</Id><Topic><Title>Income From Ops - Doubled</Title><Username>cohsgrad</Username><Timestamp>1359065338732</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:08:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now, I will agree with the premise of not having all of your money tied up in your own company's stock. See Enron as an example. Having a small part of your portfolio invested in the company you work for would not be excessive. I would think it would be prudent, since you have better/more accurate information about the prospects. Besides, I am not talking about some guy/girl working the phones at Etrade. I am talking about guys/girls who make 1 plus mil per year. Would it kill them to buy 10k shares in the 7/8 range once in a while? You would have to think that would not be sticking your neck out in a huge way. This company is not that complicated. The most difficult part is the servicing of the mortgage portfolio and they farm that out entirely....at a huge cost.</Msg><Username>billwilliselkins</Username><Timestamp>1359130288253</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:11:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359139113478-16</Id><Title>Big strong volume</Title><Msg>Nice come back after the AH fall.

Under federal law, Medicare generally does not pay for services for either group of patients.

It was a pain to see quite a bit lost with closing the puts early since majority of the closed sold puts could be at the breakeven point by now. Maybe this quarter is different.

American Idol is at the centre of a racism row after nine black former contestants claimed that they were all forced off the show as part of a racist plan to boost ratings. The singers, from various seasons, are preparing to take legal action against the hit talent show which they say "permanently and severely impaired" their personal and professional lives. Corey Clark, Jaered Andrews, Donnie Williams, brothers Terrell Brittenum and Derrell Brittenum,Thomas Daniels, Akron Watson, Ju'Not Joyner and Chris Golightly insisted that they were targeted by producers of the Fox show who set out to humiliate them by making them audition and then disqualifying them due to their criminal records.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1359161195660</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 19:46:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359161917529-33</Id><Title>Gun control is already working!!!</Title><Msg>3 Asians backing up a pickup through the doors, emptying the gun shelfs and the getaway van is found in MPLS, suspects arrested but the guns however were not recovered because they went right down I-94 to Chicago, if they told the truth! Forget drugs - gun running for the gangs, criminals and demented! Forget the schools, there is nothing to be had - break inns, robberies and assaults are the "new games in town! For schools, theaters, gathering places, shopping malls etc. - bombing is the new weapon, you can take out more people if planed right then with a assault rifle - I think Obimbo should pass a law that bombing is illegal, if more then one bomb is used, way to go!!!
