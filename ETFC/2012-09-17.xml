Reporters are siccing tax experts on the few extant bits of documentary evidence about Romney's taxes to extrapolate what all the returns from before 2010 might contain. Theory: Mitt Romney paid no taxes in 2009. Theorist: Bloomberg Businessweek's Joshua Green Evidence: The financial crisis in 2008 cost the ultra-rich (wealth above $30 million) an average of 25 percent of their net worth, Green says. Romney fits in that category, and he probably felt major losses. "And it’s possible he suffered a large enough capital loss that, carried forward and coupled with his various offshore tax havens, he wound up paying no U.S. federal taxes at all in 2009," Green writes. Counter-evidence: Romney's campaign denied Wednesday that Romney has ever had a $0 tax bill, Politico's Alexander Burns reports. Theory: Romney had a secret Swiss bank account, and revealed it under the IRS's amnesty program in 2009. Theorist: Slate's Matt Yglesias, New York University's Daniel Shaviro (sort of) Evidence: Romney had a Swiss bank account, which the lawyer managing his blind trust closed in late 2010. In 2008, a whistleblower at UBS, the Swiss bank where Romney had his account, told the IRS about 4,000 American account holders. The IRS offered an amnesty deal for account-holders who came forward in 2009. Yglesias speculates: "Romney might well have thought in 2007 and 2008 that there was nothing to fear about a non-disclosed offshore account he'd set up years earlier precisely because it wasn't disclosed. But then came the settlement and the rush of non-disclosers to apply for the amnesty. Failing to apply for the amnesty and then getting charged by the IRS would have been both financially and politically disastrous. So amnesty it was." Why else would Romney want a Swiss bank account, Shaviro told the Huffington Post. "It's unclear why he would have valued the Swiss bank account secrecy, and it wouldn't have enabled him legally to avoid U.S. tax... This is why there's speculation that he was into the amnesty program." Counter-evidence: Bloomberg's Barro explains that Romney listed a "UBS Money Market Account" in a Federal Election Commission disclosure form in 2007. It wasn't "clearly flagged as Swiss, but it's there," Barro says. (Romney failed to report earned interest income on the $3 million account in a 2011 disclosure form, and had to amend it.) "It's possible that Romney told the FEC about the account while hiding it from the IRS, but that doesn't seem very smart." (Photo via T@H!R via Flickr.) Theory: Romney might have used his Swiss bank account to hide problematic transactions, like "any politically unpopular investments, clever and complex asset sales designed to lower Romney's tax bills." Theorist: The Huffington Post's Zach Carter and Ryan Grim Evidence: When Romney released his 2010 tax return, he did not release a separate document required by the IRS, called a Report on Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, or FBAR. Romney would have needed to file an FBAR in his foreign accounts, because not doing so would incur a big fine. Other foreign accounts that didn't generate income, but instead just executed transactions, would not show up on the tax return, but would show up on the FBAR. "Romney may not have engaged in any of those activities" listed above, the Huffington Post says, "but his as-yet-unreleased 2010 FBAR would make it easier to determine whether or not he did." Counter-evidence: Just as there is no real evidence for this speculation, there is no counter-evidence yet. Theory: Romney might have engaged in "aggressive tax planning strategies that are legally, but not politically, defensible." Theorist: Bloomberg's Josh Barro, New York University School of Law tax professor Daniel Shaviro, The New Yorker's John Cassidy, The Washington Post's Greg Sargent Evidence: Barro took a look at Green's theory, and found that though Romney's taxes show he had no taxable capital gains in 2009, he had other income. Even with a lot of deductions, "it's unlikely that these factors alone could have added up to a tax bill of $0. Of the 35,000 high income taxpayers with no tax due in 2009, by far the largest share achieved that feat by investing heavily in tax-exempt municipal bonds." Romney was not heavily invested in municipal bonds. So if Romney has something politically damaging in his tax returns, it's probably something else, like aggressive tax planning strategies. Likewise, Shaviro says: Still, willingness to do extremely aggressive tax sheltering (such as through loss generation from circular flows of cash) in 2009 would not come as a huge surprise, even though it seems like a dumb idea if you are preparing to run for president again. Cassidy notes that while Romney's tax preparers might have had politics in mind in 2010 and 2011, they might not have thought about that in earlier years. Counter-evidence: There is no counter-evidence so far, unless you count Tim Pawlenty telling CBS Wednesday that Romney's "paid a lot of taxes." (Photo via Images_of_Money via Flickr.) Theory: The taxes might just show Romney made a ton of money, had more offshore accounts, and made controversial investments. Theorist: The New Yorker's John Cassidy (sort of) Evidence: Cassidy seems to think the most likely reason Romney won't show us the tax returns is that he paid an even lower tax rate than the 14 percent shown on the 2010 taxes. But there are other possibilities. Romney's retirement agreement with Bain ended in 2009, and "quite probably it allowed Romney to keep pocketing a substantial portion of the firm’s profits." Or maybe before 2010, Romney's money managers "were even more aggressive in their use of overseas investment vehicles and tax shields." Or maybe Bain invested in controversial firms like the medical waste company that disposes of aborted fetuses, a potential problem because 'even after he left, kept much of his money in investment funds managed by the firm." Counter-evidence: Cassidy thinks these three theories are unlikely, because Romney's name is already tied to the first two -- being rich and having offshore accounts -- and the controversial investments wouldn't be worth all this tax return headache.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1347893603867</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 10:53:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347894492224-5</Id><Topic><Title>lunatic rightwingers pumping war</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347730043088</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 13:27:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jeez, sure..... all our WMD and all russia's and china's are turned off you say. and then you blather on and on. FYI even as per the SALT treaty both the USA and Russia have thousands of warheads deployed and ready. and ntm china having for sure hundreds of warheads... or thousands by some accounts. Nuclear arsenal of Russia The exact numbers of nuclear warheads remain a subject of estimations and ongoing constant discussion depending on their respective source. The Federation of American Scientists estimates that Russia possesses 4,650 active nuclear warheads, while the U.S. has 2,468.[1] Alexander Khramchikhin, an analyst at the Institute of Political and Military Analysis said Russia has 3,100 nuclear warheads while the U.S. has some 5,700.[6] According to 2011 data from the New START Treaty Aggregate Numbers of Strategic Offensive Arms facts sheet, the United States has the largest number of deployed nuclear weapons in the world, 300 more than Russia.[7] Mid-2007 Russia was estimated to have around 3,281 active strategic nuclear warheads in its arsenal.[8] Russia also has a large number of tactical nuclear weapons, although there are no treaty requirements for it to publish data on these weapons so the exact numbers are unknown.[9] An estimate by Hans Kristensen and Robert Norris estimate Russia has approximately 2,000 deployed tactical warheads.[10] Strategic nuclear forces of Russia include:[8] 1.Land based Strategic Rocket Forces: 489 missiles carrying up to 1,788 warheads; they employ immobile (silos), like SS-18 Satan, and mobile delivery systems, like SS-27 Topol M. 2.Sea based Strategic Fleet: 12 submarines carrying up to 609 warheads; they should be able to employ, in a near future, delivery systems like SS-N-30 Bulava. 3.Strategic Aviation: 79 bombers carrying up to 884 cruise missiles. As of July 2009, Russia's strategic arsenal reportedly shrunk to 2,723 warheads, including: 367 ICBMs with 1,248 warheads, 13 SSBNs with 591 warheads and 76 bombers with 884 warheads.[11] wiki</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347894492224</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 11:08:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347895140538-6</Id><Title>ETrade stealing customer funds</Title><Msg>Watch out.

So Stevens, bypassing the speechwriting staff at the campaign’s Boston headquarters, assigned the sensitive task of drafting it to Peter Wehner, a veteran of the last three Republican White Houses and one of the party’s smarter wordsmiths. Not a word Wehner wrote was ever spoken. (PHOTOS: 12 hits on Mitt Romney from the right) Stevens junked the entire thing, setting off a chaotic, eight-day scramble that would produce an hour of prime-time problems for Romney, including Clint Eastwood’s meandering monologue to an empty chair. Romney’s convention stumbles have provoked weeks of public griping and internal sniping about not only Romney but also his mercurial campaign muse, Stevens. Viewed warily by conservatives, known for his impulsiveness and described by a colleague as a “tortured artist,” Stevens has become the leading staff scapegoat for a campaign that suddenly is behind in a race that had been expected to stay neck and neck through Nov. 6. This article is based on accounts from Romney aides, advisers and friends, most of whom refused to speak on the record because they were recounting private discussions and offering direct criticism of the candidate and his staff, Stevens in particular. (Also on POLITICO: Romney abruptly shifts strategy) Stevens, in a lengthy interview Sunday afternoon, defended the campaign’s performance, refused to discuss internal conversations and insisted Romney is doing far better than the pundits portray. “Like all campaigns, we have good days and bad days. I’m happy to take responsibility for the bad days,” he said. “This is a tremendously talented team.” To pin recent stumbles on Stevens would be to overlook Romney’s role in all this. As the man atop the enterprise — in effect, the CEO of a $1 billion start-up — Romney ultimately bears responsibility for the decisions he personally oversaw, such as the muffling of running mate Paul Ryan’s strict budget message and his own convention performance. As the Tampa convention drew near, Wehner, now a “senior adviser” and blogger for the campaign, was laboring under an unusual constraint for the author of a high-stakes political speech. He was not invited to spend time with Romney, making it impossible to channel him fluently. Nevertheless, Wehner came up with a draft he found pleasing, including the memorable line: “The incumbent president is trying to lower the expectations of our nation to the sorry level of his own achievement. He only wins if you settle.” It also included a reference to Afghanistan, which was jettisoned with the rest of his work. (Also on POLITICO: 2012 election polling center) Instead, eight days before the convention, at a time when a campaign usually would be done drafting and focused instead on practicing such a high-stakes speech, Stevens frantically contacted John McConnell and Matthew Scully, a speechwriting duo that had worked in George W. Bush’s campaign and White House. Stevens told them they would have to start from scratch on a new acceptance speech. Not only would they have only a few days to write it, but Romney would have little time to practice it. McConnell and Scully, drawing on their experience writing for Vice President Dick Cheney, were racing to finish the convention speech for Romney’s running mate, Ryan (R-Wis.), the House Budget Committee chairman. It was the Wednesday before convention week. Ryan was to speak the following Wednesday, followed by Romney on Thursday. The two finished Ryan’s text the next day and started crashing on Romney’s. That weekend, Stevens accompanied Romney as he went to a school auditorium in New Hampshire with his wife, Ann, to practice yet another version of the speech. Only one paragraph from the McConnell-Scully draft wound up being used, about a rose that Romney’s father had put on his mother’s bedside table each day. The speech that was actually delivered, it turned out, had been cobbled together by Stevens and Romney himself. When asked about the various versions of the convention speech, Stevens said: “The governor writes his speeches.” Pressed on whether he does so with no help, Stevens added: “He reaches out to a lot of people. … We don’t discuss who works on what. It’s all just the Romney campaign. Everything is just the Romney campaign.” (Also on POLITICO: Mitt Romney RNC speech text, video) The hasty process resulted in a colossal oversight: Romney did not include a salute to troops serving in war zones, and did not mention Al Qaeda or Afghanistan, putting him on the defensive on national security just as the Middle East was about to erupt. It was also very light on policy specifics, much to the chagrin of conservatives who were certain the addition of Ryan and inclusion of Wehner meant a real battle of ideas was about to begin. The damage had been compounded when, in compressing the program from four days to three because of a hurricane delay, convention organizers had scrapped a planned remote appearance by Romney and veterans that was to be fed live into the Tampa hall from a speech he was giving to an American Legion convention in Indiana. With the salute-the-troops tribute out, the assumption was Romney would pay tribute to them in the speech. He didn’t. The convention finale was undermined even further by Eastwood’s rambling comedy routine, which became the only glimpse that many swing voters got of the Republican show. Eastwood had been added to the program after chatting with Romney at a fundraiser in Idaho just weeks before the convention. (PHOTOS: 5 'empty chair' incidents) Stevens and his team loved the idea of the tough-talking American icon greeting the millions of viewers tuning in to the main event. But Eastwood, unlike every other speaker at the tightly controlled convention, had free rein to say or do whatever he wanted without the campaign’s approval. Eastwood has said just minutes before going live, he was handed a chair to sit on, which he promptly decided should become a prop in his speech. Many in the Romney high command watched in fury. Later, a poll by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press found that for many voters — especially independents and casual viewers, exactly the ones convention organizers hoped to reach — the Eastwood skit, not Romney’s speech, was the highlight of the convention. (Also on POLITICO: Clint Eastwood RNC speech transcript, video) As mishaps have piled up, Stevens has taken the brunt of the blame for an unwieldy campaign structure that, as the joke goes among frustrated Republicans, badly needs a consultant from Bain &amp; Co. to straighten it out. “You design a campaign to reinforce the guy that you’ve got,” said a longtime Romney friend. “The campaign has utterly failed to switch from a primary mind-set to a general-election mind-set, and did not come up with a compelling, policy-backed argument for credible change.” In what many in the campaign now consider a fundamental design flaw, Stevens is doing three major jobs: chief strategist, chief ad maker and chief speechwriter. It would be as if George W. Bush had run for president in 2000 with one person playing the roles of Karl Rove, Mark McKinnon and Michael Gerson. Or if on the Obama campaign of 2008, David Axelrod had not been backed up by Jim Margolis, Robert Gibbs and Jon Favreau. Asked if he had assumed too many roles, Stevens said he had big teams to help him in each area. “Everybody wears a lot of hats,” he said. “We’re that kind of campaign — very un-compartmentalized.” He said that making the ads in-house has been a huge advantage. “You can walk down and stick your finger in the cookie batter.” (PHOTOS: Scenes from Republican National Convention 2012) Stevens enjoys little of the internal affection that surrounded the brain trusts of the Bush and Obama campaigns. “I always have the impression Stuart must save his best stuff for meetings I’m not important enough to attend,” said one Romney campaign insider. “The campaign is filled with people who spend a lot of their time either avoiding him or resisting him.” Stevens, who has won a string of U.S. Senate and governor’s races, worked on the Bush campaigns of 2000 and 2004, and was signed up with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in 2008, but then switched to Romney. POLITICO has learned when Romney was gearing up for his 2012 run, he made never-before-reported overtures to Ken Mehlman, the manager of Bush’s campaign, and Mike Murphy, a top strategist who remains close to Romney. Still, when Romney went for a leaner campaign with fewer consultants, Stevens was left standing. At Romney’s insistence, Stevens and his business partner, Russ Schriefer, went all in, closing the Stevens and Schriefer Group office in Washington and moving into a first-floor warren at Romney headquarters in Boston’s North End. Schriefer said Stevens “has done a very good job of keeping the campaign focused on a message of jobs and the economy, and focused on what it takes to win.” “He has a competitive spirit that translates to the rest of the team,” Schriefer said. “When there’s criticism, you’re always going to get people trying to blame someone. This is not something unusual. The important thing is that the campaign is staying very focused. We know what we want to do, and we think we’re in a very good position to win.” A mad-professor aura, combined with post-midnight calls to sleeping senior staffers, have led some colleagues to express increasing concern about what the campaign is doing to Stevens — and what Stevens is doing to the campaign. (PHOTOS: Celebrities at the Republican National Convention) The GOP convention failed to generate momentum or excitement for Romney — a potentially fatal setback for the struggling campaign. Before that, Romney’s criticism of Olympics organizers just after he landed in London set the tone for a snake-bitten foreign tour that some top campaign officials had argued against taking. Last week, Romney diluted his repeal-“Obamacare” message by saying on“Meet the Press” that he would keep part of the plan. Then Romney’s incendiary late-night statement after the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya led many conservative allies to say he had squandered credibility as a potential commander in chief. Stevens had vocal internal critics long before the recent blunders. One proposal by the strategist that drew ridicule behind his back envisioned a “Route 66” bus tour along the pre-Interstate, Dust Bowl migration highway. Other advisers argued that Romney hardly needs more retro or nostalgic connotations. That idea morphed into a blander “Every Town Counts” week, hitting smaller population centers of six target states in the Northeast and Midwest. Asked about the bus-tour ideas, Stevens said: “We bat around a lot of ideas. … The campaign has a very collegial — we have a good locker room. There’s a lot of support, a lot of collaboration, a lot of cross-pollination of idea from across the board.” But whatever Stevens’s shortcomings, presidential candidates get the campaigns they want. And Romney, who in an interview with POLITICO last month said his leadership style very much centers on having a variety of smart people offering advice and him being the decider, has taken a very active role running his own campaign. (PHOTOS: Mitt Romney through the years) In a way, that’s the problem. Romney associates are baffled that such a successful corporate leader has created a team with so few lines of authority or accountability. Romney has allowed seven distinct power centers to flourish inside his campaign, with the strategy pod, headed by Stevens and Schriefer, handling the most essential ingredient — the candidate’s public message and image. Then there is the conventional staff, led by campaign manager Matt Rhoades, who functions as an air-traffic controller. For months, Republicans inside and out of the campaign have said the structure is problematic. Rhoades, for instance, is as disciplined and methodical as Stevens is improvisational and disorganized. Add to those the old Boston hands — Beth Myers, Peter Flaherty and Eric Fehrnstrom; longtime friends and advisers — Mike Leavitt, Bob White and Ron Kaufman; newcomers with juice, especially Ed Gillespie; the family, with his sons and Ann Romney involved in many decisions; and the money folks, headed by a longtime Romney friend and helper, Spencer Zwick. Campaign officials said most parts of the Romney operation run in the rigid, metrics-driven style of Rhoades, a veteran of the buttoned-up Bush operation of 2004. These parts include finance, voter contact, legal and communications. This stands in contrast to the hazy controls over things in Stevens’s domain, the officials said. “It is organized the way enterprises are organized: There is a person in charge, and people underneath him with specific responsibilities,” a Romney official said. “There are clear goals and objectives, and constant measurement. Elsewhere in the enterprise, there are all kinds of people with influence and authority but only vague responsibilities.” Stevens, a 58-year-old son of the South, is easy for conservatives to dislike. His official bio does not exactly scream “Republican ad guy from Mississippi”: “Stuart was educated at Colorado College, Middlebury College, Oxford University and the UCLA Film School, [and] is also a former Fellow of the American Film Institute.” He is not particularly ideological, and has a big-city, Hollywood aura that grates on movement conservatives. “He’s a smart, capable guy but he sends bad signals” to the right, said a Republican operative who works closely with the campaign. “He has a lot of goofy quotes that cause everybody to shake their heads. … Stuart is one of the most insecure guys in the business. But he has become the top strategic adviser to the nominee, which is a huge accomplishment.” A Romney official explained: “Mitt is a sticker — he stays with you. He had a reputation at Bain for sticking with people. They made a bad investment, he hung with them. … None of this is going to be fixed. This is the organization, and this is who Mitt is betting on to win. There aren’t going to be further changes.” A person who recently was alone with Romney added: “Big changes would destabilize the thing.” (PHOTOS: Clint Eastwood gets political) Every profile of Stevens includes the descriptor “eclectic,” which seems fair, given he has skied to the North Pole, chronicled his use of steroids to compete in an extreme race, written novels and a campaign memoir, advised clients in Albania and Congo and consulted on Hollywood projects, including the political film “The Ides of March.” Stevens has a free-flowing way about his life and is excited by ideas he deems wonderful or weird. He enjoys a love-hate relationship with the media — firing off emails with his candid and often illuminating take on the political spat of the moment, while also stoking the media-is-so-damned-biased flames inside the campaign and among conservatives. Inside the Romney campaign, Stevens has preached a gospel of caution and consistency: Keep the candidate tightly focused on a bad economy and a worse president. In an interview last year with Robert Draper for The New York Times Magazine, Stevens explained his theory of the case this way: Philadelphia Eagles quarterback “Michael Vick’s not a real good pocket guy … So don’t tell him he can’t roll out. Try to make him the best rollout guy that’s ever played.” A growing number of conservatives are blaming Stevens for advocating a campaign of caution, one that puts all the emphasis not on how good Romney could be but how bad Obama is. “Credit for this fog goes to that inner circle of Romney advisers who never liked the Ryan pick and have reasserted their will over a candidate who is naturally cautious,” conservative columnist Kimberley Strassel wrote in Friday’s Wall Street Journal. “In the la-la land where adviser Stuart Stevens presides, Mr. Romney wins by never saying a single thing, ever, that might rock a single boat, ever.”’ Stevens was a big, early advocate of a bland vice presidential candidate, privately talking up former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and pushing the idea of an outsider, anti-Beltway ticket. But Stevens is hardly to blame for what many conservatives consider a campaign that is specifics-free and lame. That blame goes straight to the man running his own campaign: Romney himself, according to a number of people in and out of the campaign. Some Romney loyalists think Stevens never fully appreciated what a good and unique candidate they had in Romney, and pleaded early on to showcase what they saw as a generous, wise and gifted leader. Still, for reasons not fully understood by those around Romney, the candidate not only went with Stevens but gave him tremendous authority.

"How can you go out there and tell people things that just aren't true?" he asked rhetorically. He added, "This is a time for truths." In context, Romney was referring to Obama's claim that "we're adding jobs in the coal industry." In reality, the nation really is adding jobs in the coal industry -- Romney was looking for an example of the president saying something that "just isn't true," and he pointed to an Obama quote that happened to be accurate, though he told his audience the opposite. It's hard not to appreciate the ironic circle -- the president said something true, Romney lied when he said the accurate claim is false, and then he complained about falsehoods in the campaign. I don't know the Republican candidate personally, but from a distance, it appears there's a part of his brain that allows him to create some kind of deliberate blind-spot. It's actually a little scary to think of a leader -- a man who'd be given enormous power and influence, literally making life and death decisions on a regular basis -- who can convince himself that his falsehoods are true, and that others' truths are falsehoods. But here we are. If this is, as Romney claims, a "time for truths," I can only hope the Republican candidate will take a few moments to consider the 30th installment of my weekly series, chronicling Mitt's mendacity. (This is the biggest list I've ever done.) 1. At an impromptu event in South Carolina yesterday, Romney said on Medicare policy, "Our plan [has] no change for current seniors and those 55 and older." That's plainly false. Romney's plan eliminates all new benefits for seniors under the Affordable Care Act, which necessarily means higher prescription drug costs for seniors, and more expensive preventive care. 2. At the same event, Romney argued, "Under the president's plan, [Medicare] goes bankrupt... Under the plan I propose, it is solvent." That's the exact opposite of reality. Obama's policy strengthens Medicare's finances, and under Romney's plan, the system would be closer to insolvency faster. 3. In Chillicothe, Ohio, Romney said that under Obama, "We've got lower economic growth." Actually, we got higher economic growth. 4. In the same speech, Romney said that under Obama, "We've got higher unemployment." Actually, we got lower unemployment. 5. He went on to say the annual budget deficit has hit the $1 trillion mark under Obama for the "first time the history of our country." Not true. The first time in the history of our country that the deficit hit $1 trillion was George W. Bush's last year in office, when the annual shortfall was $1.3 trillion. 6. Romney added that Obama promised "he'd get the unemployment down to under 5.6 percent today if we pass that $1 trillion stimulus package." That's actually two falsehoods wrapped as one. For one thing, the stimulus wasn't $1 trillion (Romney's off by over $200 billion, and that's real money). For another, that's not what Obama promised. 7. Romney added, "You see unlike President Obama, I won't raise taxes on small business." Obama has repeatedly cut taxes on small businesses -- by some counts, 18 times -- and if given a second term, his tax plan would have no effect on 97% of small businesses. 8. In an interview with Fortune magazine, Romney said the president's stimulus measures "have not put Americans back to work." Yes they have. 9. In the same interview, Romney said he would create jobs by "taking advantage of America's energy resources, particularly natural gas, as well as coal, oil, nuclear, solar, and wind." Much of this is contradicted by Romney's own agenda. He opposes the wind production tax credit, no matter how many jobs it costs the nation, and has vowed to cut off investments in renewable energy programs (Romney has said wind and solar do not constitute "real energy.") 10. Romney went on to say, "A nation which is a highly productive nation as we are benefits by trade with others... The Obama administration has negotiated no new [trade] agreements." Did Romney not hear about the trade agreements with Panama, Colombia, and South Korea? 11. Romney added, "We have to cut the deficit and get America on track to a balanced budget in order to convince investors that America is a good place to invest long term.... The president has done virtually nothing other than to propose a series of tax increases." Actually, Obama proposed a massive, $4 trillion "grand bargain," most of which was made up of spending cuts. Congressional Republicans turned it down anyway. 12. Romney also said, "We're at a 30-year low in new business startups." Still not true. 13. Romney went on to say, "I indicated as I announced my tax plan that the key principles included the following. First, that high-income people would continue to pay the same share of the tax burden that they do today." At a minimum, this is ridiculously misleading. Under Romney's plan, high-income people would get an enormous tax break. 14. Romney added, "Obamacare is a tax. It's been so determined by the Supreme Court, and it falls predominantly on the middle class." He's referring to an individual mandate that would apply to 1% of the population. And if President Obama's health care policy "raised taxes on the middle class," then Mitt Romney raised taxes on the middle class. 15. Romney also said, "President Obama raises taxes on the middle class. I will under no circumstances raise taxes on the middle class." There's overwhelming evidence to the contrary. 16. Romney went on to say, "I will follow a model similar to Simpson-Bowles." No he won't. 17. Romney also said, "I believe infrastructure is going to see very substantial investments over the coming decade." He may believe that, but he's also endorsed a budget plan that drastically curtails infrastructure investments. 18. Romney argued, "I believe that you're going to see us having created 12 million new jobs." If we do nothing, we're on track to create 12 million new American jobs over the next four years anyway. 19. In a televised ad, Romney said Obama "cut $716 billion dollars from Medicare ... to pay for Obamacare." Oh, please. 20. The ad goes on to say, in reference to seniors, "So now the money you paid for your guaranteed healthcare is going to a massive new government program that's not for you." That's plainly false. Under the Affordable Care Act, seniors pay less for prescription medication and preventive care -- meaning the policy is "for" them, too. 21. At a campaign stop in Ohio, Romney said under Obama we're not "adding jobs in the coal industry" and not "producing more coal." Romney's lying. In reality, we're adding jobs in the coal industry and producing more coal. 22. Romney said this week that Paul Ryan reached out to Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to "co-lead a piece of legislation that makes sure we can save Medicare." According to Ron Wyden, that's ridiculously untrue. 23. In another attack ad this week, Romney once again accused Obama of "quietly ending work requirements" in the welfare law." He's still blatantly lying. 24. In Beallsville, Ohio, Romney argued, "President said he'd cut the deficit in half. He's doubled it." Maybe Romney doesn't know what "double" means. The deficit on Obama's first day was $1.3 trillion. Last year, it was also $1.3 trillion. This year, it's projected to be $1.1 trillion. When he says the president "more than doubled" the deficit, as he has many times, Romney's lying. 25. In the same speech, Romney added that Obama has "raided that [Medicare] trust fund." Obama has strengthened the Medicare trust fund. 26. Romney went on to call the Affordable Care Act an "unproven federal government takeover to health care." There is no universe in which this makes sense -- "Obamacare" relies on private insurers, not a government takeover. (Also, it's not "unproven" -- the policy works quite well in, ahem, Massachusetts.) 27. Romney also said, "My number four [goal] is to stop spending massively more than we take in to get America on track to have a balanced budget. And I'll do it." No you won't. Romney says his plan "can't be scored," but independent budget analysts have found his agenda would make the deficit bigger, not smaller, and add trillions to the national debt. 28. Romney went on to say, "Seventy-five percent of small businesses in this country surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce said that Obamacare makes it less likely for them to hire people." The "survey" is a joke. The Chamber, a pro-Republican lobbying institution heavily invested in helping Romney, put up an unscientific online survey. Treating this as a legitimate poll of businesses is fundamentally dishonest. 29. Romney also said, "I'm going to put work back into welfare." Work hasn't been taken out of welfare. 30. Romney went on to say, "[Obama] said if you have a business, you didn't build that. Someone else did that." That's not even close to what the president said. 31. At an event in St. Augustine, Florida, Romney said the president "won't want to remind people of Greece because that's where he's taking our country if we don't get off the road we're on." That's painfully untrue. 32. In the same speech Romney said of the president, "He said he'd measure progress also by whether people were able to have a good job that kept them in their home and paid their mortgage. Well, 8.5 million homes foreclosed, a record level, is not success, Mr. President." Putting aside how dishonest it is for Romney to blame the housing crash on the president, let's also not forget that Romney intends to deliberately avoid any efforts to curtail foreclosures. 33. Romney added, "I'm going to take every government program and apply this test: Is this program so critical it's worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if it's not, we'll get rid of it." This continues to be misleading. The implication here is that U.S. debt is financed by the Chinese, but this isn't true -- China only holds about 8% of the nation's debt.

In Houston, high school nurse Terry Collins got a letter informing her that after 34 years of voting she was off the Harris County rolls. Sorry. "Friday of last week, I got a letter saying that my voting registration would be revoked because I'm deceased, I'm dead. I was like, 'Oh, no I'm not!' " Collins says. In order to stay on the rolls, the 52-year-old nurse had to call and inform the registrar of her status among the living. She tried, but it didn't go so well. "When I tried to call I was on hold for an hour, never got anyone," she says. "I called three days in a row and was on hold for an hour or more." Collins, who is black, says she noticed that in Houston, quite a few of those who got the letters seemed to be older and black. "There's one lady here. She's 52. She's African-American. Her dad is 80. They both got a letter saying they're dead," she says. Like all states, Texas regularly purges its rolls of voters who've died. Normally, this is a low-key process where the state passes along to the counties a small list of dead voters as they become available. But this massive mailing two months before the election is new. ---------- In South Carolina, Pennsylvania and several other states, new voter ID laws are being challenged in court just eight weeks before the general election.

The person who uploaded a series of potentially inflammatory videos from the fundraiser has claimed authorship of them in an email exchange with The Huffington Post. The source said he or she wishes to remain anonymous for professional reasons and to avoid a lawsuit. The videos, which have created a buzz on the Internet, were blurred and at times blacked out to obscure the location of the filming, the source said. "I have obviously degraded the quality to attempt to camo the location," said the clandestine filmmaker. The original, which has not been posted in full, is very high quality, the source said. The source has given the full video to Mother Jones' David Corn, the source said. The videos capture Romney speaking loosely about Obama supporters, immigrants, privilege and a host of other controversial issues. The candidate seems unguarded and displays the sense of humor that is often mentioned by those close to him, but is so rarely on public display. The Romney campaign did not respond to a request for comment. It's Romney's remark about the president's backers that might have the most potential to undermine his candidacy, however, as Romney seeks to persuade people who voted for Obama in 2008 to switch this time. "There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what," Romney says in one clip. "All right -- there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that, that they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing." Romney's comments on the video go a step beyond his August claim, made in public, that the Obama administration's state-by-state welfare waivers were an effort to "shore up his base." In the behind-closed-doors speech to donors, Romney seems to be suggesting that nearly half of Americans expect to have all their needs supplied by the government. "[M]y job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives," Romney also said in the video, according to Mother Jones. As for the other 53 percent? Romney may have been referencing a meme started by conservative blogger Erick Erickson, who has noted that only 53 percent of Americans pay federal income taxes. Erickson argued that the rest of the country, and in particular the Occupy Wall Street movement, should "suck it up you whiners." The notion that Democrats hope to ride dependency to political power is one that has no shortage of adherents among conservatives. “We are reaching the tipping point where the majority of Americans are recipients of government programs,” columnist George Will said recently on Laura Ingraham's radio show. "Heavens, one in seven of Americans is on food stamps today. The gamble -- it's really not a gamble, the tactic -- of the Democratic Party is to run up the dependency ratio in this country until you get 50-60 percent of Americans dependent on the government in at least one or often in multiple ways, at which point they figure the party of government will always win." But there are a few problems with the idea of the overburdened "53 percent." Many Americans don't pay federal income taxes, in part, because of deductions like the child tax credit that have been championed by conservatives and progressives alike. Almost all of the "47 percent" do pay other federal taxes in the form of Social Security and Medicare payroll deductions and gas levies, as well as a variety of state and local sales and property taxes that aren't dependent on income. A separate video clip with Romney addressing deplorable conditions at a Chinese factory began making the rounds on the Internet last month. In that video, he contrasted the conditions he witnessed on a business trip to China with conditions in the United States, where he said, "Ninety-five percent of life is set up for you if you were born in this country." Commentators have seized on the assertion that people are mostly set if they're born in the U.S. In fact, tens of millions of Americans are jobless or living in poverty. The notion also cuts against one of Romney's campaign themes, which is that those who are successful have gotten to where they are on their own. In addition, the video is notable for Romney's recounting of conditions he saw at the factory. By his own telling, he seemed satisfied when the factory owner told him the barbed wire was to keep job-seekers out, not to keep workers in. Romney may have been referring to conditions at Global Tech Appliances Inc., a Chinese manufacturer, in which Bain Capital invested, that was fined $2.65 million for ripping off a deep-fat fryer design, according to Boston Globe reporter Matt Viser. There are at least 10 of these videos, each allegedly clipped from the same fundraiser. A YouTube link to the Chinese factory clip, it turns out, was initially posted in May in the comments section of The Huffington Post under the handle romneyexposed. The commenter posted a link to a YouTube account by the same name, which includes a version of the factory video and three others. Six more videos exist under another account. In one of the other videos, Romney lamented, in a joking way, that he would have a better chance of being elected if his father had been ethnically Mexican, rather than born to white parents then living in Mexico. "My dad, as you probably, know was the governor of Michigan and was the head of a car company. But he was born in Mexico ... and, uh, had he been born of, uh, Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot at winning this," Romney said. "But he was unfortunately born to Americans living in Mexico. ... I mean I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino." In a separate video, Romney talks about his success. "Both my dad and [wife] Ann's dad did quite well in their lives. But when they came to the end of their lives and passed along the inheritance to Ann and me, we both decided to give it all away. So I have inherited nothing. Everything that Ann and I have, we earned the old-fashioned way." Romney's parents did pay for his boarding school, his college, his graduate school and his first home. He got closer to the truth in another clip. "There's a perception that all of you were born with a silver spoon. You know, you never had to earn anything and so forth," Romney said to the donors. "Frankly, I was born with a silver spoon, which is the greatest gift you can have -- which is to get born in America."

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) would close if elected, on the same day the campaign vowed to "reinforce more specifics" regarding what a Romney presidency would look like. The Republican presidential nominee sought to refocus the debate on the economy with the release of two new ads on Monday, after his campaign spent much of last week trying to mitigate the criticism he incited when he condemned President Barack Obama's handling of attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions in Egypt and Libya. According to campaign aides, the new push will include a series of speeches aimed at laying out more detailed plans for a Romney-Ryan administration. Romney will focus on job creation, energy independence and reducing the deficit, while Ryan will highlight plans to deal with the debt and deficit. But the specifics stop short when it comes to answering the looming tax loophole question, based on a new interview with Ryan released late Sunday night and a Romney campaign conference call held Monday morning to discuss the state of the race. Romney and Ryan have repeatedly stated that they would offset tax cuts for the wealthy by closing tax loopholes, without identifying which particular loopholes they would close. The new interview with Ryan, conducted by David Brody of CBN News, offers little variation on their standard response. Asked whether there's a reason he and Romney aren't naming specific tax loopholes, Ryan responded, "Yes because we want to get it done." He went on to explain that his 12 years of experience on the House Ways and Means Committee has made him "very familiar with how to make successful tax reforms take place." "We want to say this is our vision, lower tax rates across the board for families and small businesses and work on the loopholes that are enjoyed by the higher income earners, take away their tax shelters so more of their income is subject to taxation," Ryan said. "That lowers everybody’s tax rates. And we have to be able to work with Congress on those details, on how to fill it in and more to the point we don’t want to cut some backroom deal that they did with Obamacare where we hatched some plan behind the scenes and they spring it on the country." "We want to do this in front, in the public, through congressional hearings with Congress so that we can get to the best conclusion with a public participation," he continued. "That’s the process that works the best to ultimate success gets this done. That’s why we’re doing it this way.” On the Monday conference call, intended to preview some of the newly promised "specifics," Romney adviser Ed Gillespie brushed off a question about tax loopholes from Jonathan Karl of ABC News, pivoting instead to energy independence. "As to the specifics, like I noted, for example, and there’s more specifics today relative to debt reduction," Gillespie said. "We'll talk about more specifics, for example, we talk about -- you know -- being energy independent by 2020, but what the governor’s going to do and Paul [Ryan] and others will reinforce the facts." Gillespie went on to say that the campaign has learned that Americans want to hear more details from Romney and Ryan on how they would accomplish their stated goals, but he did not include the words "tax loopholes" in his answer. The Obama campaign was quick to seize on the tax loophole issue, releasing a new ad and memo last week that offered its own explanation. HuffPost’s Jon Ward reports: Obama has delivered a simple message, saying Romney would give tax cuts to the rich and raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it. Obama wants to raise taxes on those with higher incomes. Romney's plan is to lower rates for all brackets, and pay for it in large part by closing corporate and individual loopholes. But he has refused to say which loopholes he would close, and so Obama has filled in these gaps for him, alleging that he would eliminate exemptions for middle-class households such as the mortgage interest deduction, or the exclusion for employer-provided health insurance. Romney has insisted that any increases that result from eliminating loopholes in the code would land on upper incomes.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1347916935765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 17:22:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347920229121-23</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot and Lyin' Ryan stumble on specifics</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1347916935765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 17:22:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Obama has delivered a simple message, saying Romney would give tax cuts to the rich and raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it."

Instead, tax cuts for the rich merely exacerbate income inequality, CRS found: Throughout the late-1940s and 1950s, the top marginal tax rate was typically above 90%; today it is 35%. Additionally, the top capital gains tax rate was 25% in the 1950s and 1960s, 35% in the 1970s; today it is 15%. The real GDP growth rate averaged 4.2% and real per capita GDP increased annually by 2.4% in the 1950s. In the 2000s, the average real GDP growth rate was 1.7% and real per capita GDP increased annually by less than 1%. There is not conclusive evidence, however, to substantiate a clear relationship between the 65-year steady reduction in the top tax rates and economic growth. Analysis of such data suggests the reduction in the top tax rates have had little association with saving, investment, or productivity growth. However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be associated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution. As this chart shows, per capita GDP growth rates and the top tax rate have essentially no relationship: This jibes with other recent studies that show little relationship between the top tax rate and economic growth. A new analysis by Owen M. Zidar, a former staff economist on President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers and a graduate student at California-Berkeley, found that “a one percent of GDP tax cut for the bottom 90% results in 2.7 percentage points of GDP growth over a two-year period. The corresponding estimate for the top 10% is 0.13 percentage points and is insignificant statistically.” GDP growth, business investment, and a host of other economic indicators were all stronger during the 1990s, after taxes were raised on the rich, than during the supply-side eras of Presidents George W. Bush and Reagan.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347928733900</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 20:38:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347930870602-25</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot caught on tape</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1347915563510</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 16:59:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This just gets juicier.

So I’ve only been half in touch with the news today. And I’m just getting up to speed on this purported tape of Mitt Romney saying he thinks the 47% of Americans who support Barack Obama are moochers who believe the government has to take care of them. It’s rare when the impact of some gaffe or embarrassment or revelation isn’t overstated on first blush. But this may just be that rare exception. This tape strikes me as absolutely devastating. First, provenance. Our news team is currently reporting the story out. I don’t know the provenance of the tape. It’s apparently been bouncing around on the interwebs before getting published by Mother Jones. But I know David Corn. And he wouldn’t have posted it under his name if he weren’t pretty certain he had the authenticity of the tape nailed. So I’m assuming the tape is legit for the purposes of what I say below. As for the tape itself, this is a fine distillation of the most rancid version of the libertarian conservative worldview. Democrats are moochers and losers who can’t get their act together and think the government owes them food, board, health care and basically whatever else they want. You don’t need to look long to find this version of reality on the web. But this isn’t some right-wing blogger. It’s the Republican candidate for President of the United States. Here’s the actual text … There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that’s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax. Shortly after this part Romney says this: “My job is is not to worry about those people. I’ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.” And here’s the video … Fringier folks in the GOP say things like this. Gary Bauer did just a couple days ago when he said Obama’s coalition was made up of welfare recipients and vote fraudsters. Bauer though was smart enough not to put a percentage to the charge. Doing so deprives Romney of a vital wiggle room. He’s not just talking about some few percentage points that make up the moocher vote. He’s talking about everybody who supports Obama. So if some Democrat says that if you support Barack Obama, Romney is talking about you, that Democrat would be on steel-reinforced ground. Are you one of those 47% of the electorate that the polls consistently tell us support Barack Obama? He’s talking about you. It’s not an exaggeration. So the country is divided in two: on one side, the self-sufficient and high-achieving Republicans and on the other side the losers who think government needs to take care of them. This is the caricature of Mitt Romney, who was born on 3rd base (in Ann Richards memorable phrase), thinks he hit a triple and thinks the broad middle class who’ve relied on government for student loans or social security or anything else are losers who can’t get their act together and take responsibility for themselves. Only this tape says that caricature Mitt Romney is the real Mitt Romney. Big problem.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1347933225886</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 21:53:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347938538383-27</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot caught on tape</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1347915563510</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 16:59:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney "47 Percent" Fundraiser Host: Hedge Fund Manager Who Likes Sex Parties Source: Mother Jones When Mitt Romney at a private fundraiser dismissed all Barack Obama voters as moochers and victims—showing disdain for nearly half of the American electorate—he was speaking at the home of controversial private equity manager Marc Leder in Boca Raton on May 17, 2012. This is evident from references made by Romney within the full video recording of the event that has been reviewed by Mother Jones. When Mother Jones first disclosed secret video of Romney's remarks, we were obliged to not reveal details regarding the time and place of the event. That restriction has been lifted, as the story has garnered attention throughout the media. -snip- But Leder does differ from Romney in one significant fashion: how he likes to have a certain sort of fun. In August 2011, the New York Post reported, It was as if the Playboy Mansion met the East EBond at a wild party at private-equity titan Marc Leder's Bridgehampton estate, where guests cavorted nude in the pool and performed sex acts, scantily dressed Russians danced on platforms and men twirled lit torches to a booming techno beat. The divorced Sun Capital Partners honcho rented a sprawling beachfront mansion on Surf Side Road for $500,000 for the month of July. Leder's weekly Friday and Saturday night parties have become the talk of the Hamptons—and he ended them in style last weekend with his wildest bash yet. Russell Simmons and ex-wife Kimora Lee attended a more subdued party thrown by Leder—who's an event chair for Simmons' Art For Life charity—on July 29 together. But the revelry hit a frenzied point the next day before midnight when a male guest described as a "chubby white meathead" and a "tanned" female guest stripped and hopped into the pool naked. Mother Jones also quotes the NY Times saying that Leder's company, Sun Capital, "represents everything that's wrong" with private equity, with roughly 1/5 of the companies it owns declaring bankruptcy since 2008, including the restaurant chain Friendly's, which a federal agency accused Sun Capital of pushing into bankruptcy to avoid paying employee pensions.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1347938538383</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 23:22:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
