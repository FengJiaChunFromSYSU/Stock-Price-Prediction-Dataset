Seems like the radio hosts are picking up where the priests left off..... we could debate which one has done a bigger number on you, but the combined result is not debatable. No facts, just frenzy-whipped anger that they cultivate and cherish. But since you are a religious man..... Remember that fairy tale about the snake in a tree talking sweetly and making perfect sense while convincing the guy to break gods rules???

In both cases, Boehner acknowledged that the conservative wing of the House is driving the agenda. “We’ve got 17 new members that have not had the opportunity to vote on the President’s health care law,” Boehner said, referring to next week’s ACA repeal vote. “Frankly they’ve been asking for an opportunity to vote on it, and we’re going to give it to them.”</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1368213185285</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 15:13:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368215055443-9</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi ??

This scheme will be known as RAPE (Retire Aged People Early). Persons selected to be RAPED can apply to the Government to be considered for the SHAFT program (Special Help After Forced Termination). Persons who have been RAPED and SHAFTED will be reviewed under the SCREW program (System Covering Retired-Early Workers). A person may be RAPED once, SHAFTED twice and SCREWED as many times as the Government deems appropriate. Persons who have been RAPED could get AIDS (Additional Income for Dependents &amp; Spouse) or HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel Early Severance). Obviously persons who have AIDS or HERPES will not be SHAFTED or SCREWED any further by the Government. Persons who are not RAPED and are staying on will receive as much #$%$ (Special High Intensity Training) as possible. The Government has always prided themselves on the amount of #$%$ they give our citizens. Should you feel that you do not receive enough #$%$, please bring this to the attention of your congressman, who has been trained to give you all the #$%$ you can handle. Sincerely, The Committee for Economic Value of Individual Lives (E.V.I.L.)
