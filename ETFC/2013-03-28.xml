Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said Thursday that his decision to publicly support same-sex marriage was driven by personal interactions with gay couples in his home state. "I just think it’s time. You know, I spent most of my life – and I’m 56 years of age – on a farm 12 miles west of Big Sandy," Tester said during an interview on HuffPost Live. "And over the last six years for sure, and some time before that, I’ve gotten to know a lot of different people, a lot of folks that I normally wouldn’t know, and found them all to be good and I respect [them]. So I guess it’s broadening the horizons that I had before that’s gotten me to this point. "I think it’s just the people you run into, the people you meet, the goodness in people and the example they set," Tester continued. "And it just kind of takes away a lot of the stereotypes that were in my head and I got to a point where, you know, I asked myself as a policymaker, as a U.S. senator, is it right that I should be denying somebody the right of happiness? And it wasn’t and that’s why we made a decision." This past week, Tester was one of several Democratic senators who announced that they had evolved on the issue of marriage equality. His show of support was one of the more unexpected, owing to his gruff public persona and the political leanings of his home state. But Tester, who said he made his decision just a few days ago, explained that his decision was driven in part by libertarian-type skepticism of federal government overreach. "I really think that people’s right to happiness shouldn’t be dictated by some policymaker in Washington, D.C.," he said. "I’ve come to know a lot of people that –- sexual orientation is such where they're in love with people from the same sex, and I just don’t think it’s our role in the government to say no you can’t be married. They love one another just as much as my wife and I love one another or more. And I think it’s important that we give them that ability to be happy."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1364489590953</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 12:53:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364490119566-16</Id><Topic><Title>Cash costs of NRA insanity</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1364479271208</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 10:01:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I noticed you carefully avoided the other side of the coin, the sky high TAX costs to the country in subsidized or free abortions on demand, and of course the total lack of studies by the left on who's committing the gun crimes, the law abiding citizen or the criminal?

Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said Wednesday that her views on gay marriage are "evolving," but stopped short of endorsing it. "The term 'evolving view' has been perhaps overused, but I think it is an appropriate term for me to use," she said, following an address at the Chugiak-Eagle River Chamber of Commerce, according to the Chugiak-Eagle River Star. Murkowski elaborated on her stance to Alaska Public Radio. "I think you are seeing a change in attitude, change in tolerance, I guess, and an acceptance that what marriage should truly be about is a lasting, loving, committed relationship with respect to the individual," she said. Her comments came on the same day as the Supreme Court heard arguments challenging the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act. Murkowski's openness toward same-sex marriage is unusual among members of her caucus, save for Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), who recently expressed his support after his son came out as gay. But most Senate Republicans remain opposed. When Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), for instance, was recently asked about his position, he responded by saying, "I'm not gay, so I'm not going to marry one." Nine Senate Democrats remain publicly opposed to same-sex marriage as well. Murkowski's statement is similar to one previously made by President Barack Obama, who repeatedly said his views on same-sex marriage were "evolving" before he came out in favor in May 2012.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1364490362693</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 13:06:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364491031601-18</Id><Topic><Title>Guns saves lives and property</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1364480388387</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 10:19:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"This data is from a peer-reviewed article published in the International Journal of Epidemiology in 1998 (Krug EG.

Total firearm deaths in the US were found to occur at a rate of 14.24 per 100,000 persons, the highest rate of all countries studied, and a rate that was eight-fold higher than the combined rate of firearm deaths in all economically similar countries, and 1.5 times higher than the combined rate for the “upper middle income” countries.

For all countries studied, the combined death rate due to firearms was 6.9 per 100,000 persons, less than half the death rate due to firearms found in the US.

Writing in the peer-reviewed journal Annals of Emergency Medicine, Dr. Wiebe reported on a case-controlled study in which household were matched on a number of demographic factors, and then incidences of gun violence were compared. They found that people who keep a gun in their home are almost twice as likely to die in a gun-related homicide, and that the risk was especially greater for women: women living in a home where there is a gun are almost three times more likely to die in a gun-related homicide than men similarly situated. The risk of killing oneself using a gun was almost 17 times greater for persons who live in a home where there is a gun, compared to those in homes without guns. (Wiebe D.

The study by Wiebe shows that having a gun at home is associated with an increased risk of dying by gunfire, so gun ownership does not appear to be protective of violent firearms-related killings. But the Wiebe study was also able to compute the likelihood of dying by violence other than gunfire. They found there was no relationship between owning a gun and homicide by means other than a gun. In other words, having a gun around is not associated with a decreased risk of homicide of any sort. The study could find no empiric evidence that owning a gun confers some protection on a household from homicide. To my knowledge, there is no peer-reviewed study published anywhere that provides evidence that guns or gun ownership protects individuals from death or injury. If anyone reading this knows of such a study, I hope they will tell me so I can go read that study.

Unless I go for the rifle by the bed, or the M1919A4 on a pintle near the foot of the bed (temporarily, for maintenance, though the ammo for it is elsewhere), my "immediate defense" handgun already HAS a round in the chamber, and a reflex sight (Burris FastFireII, if nothing else installing one for awhile in place of your rear sight will increase your latency in the point/shoot reflex so you're on target faster), and I don't do warning shots. You get ONE chance to identify yourself, and then absent me not knowing where someone in the house is then its either tail to the trail, hands to the sky, or leaving in a baggie. I follow police rules, don't fire until they drop to the ground. Given I use the obsolete SS192 round for personal defense, the result it chancy, either instant death, or almost instant death . . . Now when a criminal has to consider that without good data (like when those idiot newspapers in effect reported which houses in their area DIDN'T have licensed gun owners living there) there's a good chance on entering a dwelling he might get blown away for a PS/3, well, it sort of puts things in perspective. Maybe not so much for him, as for his surviving fellows, who at that point might decide to take up another line of "work". The Korean shop owners during the King riots (Rodney, the Thug, not Martin, the adulterer) certainly appreciate the use of their firearms, as it saved many their stores, and the police did little afterward save pick up the bodies of the dead rioters (urban "youth") and haul them away. I know that more people have been persecuted and killed by the government for owning firearms LEGALLY in ONE instance than were killed in both Sandy Hook and Newton, and I know that this sort of power, particularly in government hands where the right (hand) frequently doesn't know what the left (hand) is doing, must be shared by the people if we are to remain a free and independant nation.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1364496413393</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 14:46:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364498291567-30</Id><Title>Breaking!!!</Title><Msg>BO to be POTUS for another 200 weeks.

"Enrollment in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as the modern-day food-stamp benefit is known, has soared 70% since 2008 to a record 47.8 million as of December 2012. The biggest factor behind the upward march of food stamps is a sluggish job market and a rising poverty rate. At the same time, many states have pushed to get more people to apply for SNAP, a program where the federal government picks up the tab. But there is another driver, which has its origins in President Bill Clinton's 1996 welfare overhaul. In recent years, the law has enabled states to ease asset and income tests for would-be participants, with the encouragement of the Obama administration, allowing into the program people with relatively higher incomes as well as savings.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1364500051784</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 15:47:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364514813518-33</Id><Topic><Title>Guns saves lives and property</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1364480388387</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 10:19:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>To get to the rack of antique Japanese swords you'd have to cross my firelane.

Otherwise . . . OK, having people respond, even if they can't enter, would deter someone from trying to break in. Allowing the security company to enter when we're away for extended periods is a reasonable precaution as if someone got in it would take a significant amount of time to open my safe unless they had some REALLY expensive hardware. And if they blew the door the reaction that ensued would depend on WHICH safe they choose to blow. One choice would be REALLY bad as that's the ammo locker, and while its designed to funnel an INTERNAL explosion OUT, I'm not sure how well that would work if the explosion was initiated from the outside. At worst . . . hmm I gotta make me a note on that, redesign the door so it opens inwards for the ammo, outwards for the weapons. I'd hate to ACCIDENTALLY injure an intruder, even one trying to blow one of my safe doors. Thanks, alarm systems right now are fairly basic, but once I'm in the sticks and leave the ranch I'll need better security than what I have now. As far as when I'm home, that part doesn't worry me as much, but every time we go out of town for a significant amount of time I wonder if just telling the cops and using a passive alarm along with a couple titanium safe is good enough. If I'm that worried about it in the city I'll be even more worried about it in the country, though we're fairly far from any high crime concentrations (too much work to go that far). I SURE don't want to pay what they want for an active alarm system (passive ones call in if triggered usually by an open switch (door, window) or motion sensors (not a good idea with pets), active ones do continuous monitoring and look for anomalies, much much more pricey, but they CAN be programmed to accept pets Building my FOB this summer, starting the main house right after the "temporary" house is finished.

It turns out that suicide is the leading cause of death for Americans who have purchased a handgun within the previous year. (data published in the New England Journal of Medicine – Wintermute GJ. NEJM. 2008; 358:1421-4). Like cigarette smoke, owning a firearm has deleterious effects on everyone in the home, not just on the one who purchased the gun. Writing in the peer-reviewed journal Annals of Emergency Medicine, Dr. Wiebe reported on a case-controlled study in which household were matched on a number of demographic factors, and then incidences of gun violence were compared. They found that people who keep a gun in their home are almost twice as likely to die in a gun-related homicide, and that the risk was especially greater for women: women living in a home where there is a gun are almost three times more likely to die in a gun-related homicide than men similarly situated. The risk of killing oneself using a gun was almost 17 times greater for persons who live in a home where there is a gun, compared to those in homes without guns. (Wiebe D. Annals of Emergency Medicine. 2003; 41:771-82)."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1364522447407</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 22:00:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364526158887-38</Id><Topic><Title>Guns saves lives and property</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1364480388387</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 10:19:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>unlucky, Yes, you are indeed unlucky and do you know why?
