The first is that Ryan is a next-generation leader of supply-side economics, firmly understanding that liberating free-market forces and increasing the amount of money in the economy that private individuals and organizations can invest and direct maximizes growth and prosperity. He is the next generation of the fiscal philosophy of Ronald Reagan, Jack Kemp, and Steve Forbes—all of whom Ken Blackwell worked with, explaining why he’s chairing the effort to highlight Ryan’s credentials in this arena. The second is that Ryan is a constitutional conservative—who understands that the three legs of the Reagan coalition—economic, social, and national security conservatives, are interdependent, not rivals. Social issues are economic issues, as the data is overwhelming that intact families are engines of economic growth, prudent investment, and wealth creation, while fractured families too often result to government dependency and economic waste. Children raised in supportive households with a father and mother are more likely to graduate high school and college, and have a productive career and successful marriage. Ryan understands this reality, having worked hard to help his own family after his father died when Ryan was sixteen years old." http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2012/08/12/New-SuperPAC-Launched-to-Defend-Paul-Ryan-Against-Leftist-Distortions</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1344869900000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 10:58:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344869925000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt SAID he will pay zero income tax</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1344810471000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 18:27:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get rich.

Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has only seen two of his bills pass into law during that time. Ryan, who Mitt Romney has tapped as his running mate, passed a bill into law in July 2000 that renames a post office in his district. Thanks to Ryan, the post office on 1818 Milton Ave. in Janesville, Wis., is now known as "Les Aspin Post Office Building." The other time Ryan saw one of his bills become law was in December 2008, with legislation to change the way arrows (as in bows and arrows) are hit with an excise tax. Specifically, his bill amended the Internal Revenue Code to impose a 39-cent tax per arrow shaft, instead of a 12.4 percent tax on the sales price. The bill also "includes points suitable for use with arrows in the 11 percent excise tax on arrow parts and accessories." Kevin Seifert, Ryan's congressional spokesman, did not respond to a request for comment. UPDATE: 2:30 p.m. -- It appears Ryan had a personal interest in passing the arrow tax bill: He is an accomplished bowhunter. Jay McAninch, president of the Archery Trade Association, earlier this year praised Ryan on his blog for pushing that bill through. "Congressman Ryan has never asked for anything from the archery industry when he’s done things for bowhunting," McAninch said. "Nearly 10 years ago, he led an effort to change the tax on arrows and level the playing field for arrow manufacturers, especially those making arrows on American soil. For that, he took nothing from us except our thanks and gratitude."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344870614000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344870943000-22</Id><Title>Halloween candy &amp; stuff already 90 days early</Title><Msg>Walmart, Walgreens, Target and Dollar General all had Halloween merchadise out on the floor along with the back to school stuff.

Given disenfranchising polling place Photo ID restriction laws Republicans have enacted in nearly a dozen states over the past year, you'd think there was an epidemic of Democratic "voter fraud" in this nation.

Over the past year, very high profile Republicans --- including this year's presumed standard bearer, Mitt Romney; the Sec. of State of Indiana (the first state to institute polling place Photo ID restrictions) Charlie White; one time GOP front-runner Newt Gingrich; MO's new GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate Todd Akin; and the group hired the Sacramento, CA Republican Party to collect voter registrations this year for Rep.

So really, should we be surprised to learn that four aides to former long-shot GOP Presidential candidate and U.S. House Rep. Thaddeus McCotter --- Representative of the state's 11th and one of its most Republican districts --- were indicted yesterday on dozens of criminal felony and misdemeanor election fraud charges for having turned in over 1,500 forged and falsified signatures in a "blatant" and "disgraceful" attempt, as the state's Republican AG described it, to qualify the Congressman for this year's ballot?... The charges were filed yesterday by MI Attorney General Bill Schuette against McCotter staffers Don Yowchuang, Paul Seewald, Mary Melissa Turnbull and Lorianne O'Brady. According to the Detroit Free Press, "Most of the charges were filed against McCotter's Deputy District Director Don Yowchuang and District Director Paul Seewald. Yowchuang faces 17 charges — 11 felonies and six misdemeanors — and Seewald 10 — one felony and nine misdemeanors." In all, the four were indicted on 12 felony and 21 misdemeanor election fraud-related charges. The investigators' report [PDF], details each of the hundreds of fraudulent signatures and petitions submitted by the four aides and, as they described, "revealed that the petition collection efforts were carried out by a dysfunctional congressional staff that had completely lost its moral compass." The investigators found that the Republican "Staffers function in a culture completely indifferent to the requirements of law, and with the arrogant attitude that the rules simply did not apply to them."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344872399000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:39:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344872471000-25</Id><Topic><Title>Voter ID laws simply GOP voter suppression</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344745665000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 00:27:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Though "fraudulent nominating petitions were submitted for the 2012 elections cycle," the report concluded, "perhaps even more disturbing is the fact that evidence indicates similar fraudulent petitions schemes were used in prior elections." After the fraudulent signatures were discovered, there were not enough left for McCotter to qualify for this years ballot. Amazingly, just 1,000 valid signatures were needed. After the fraudulent ones were tossed, just 244 were left. McCotter himself was not indicted, though, according to The Detroit News, the state AG described him as "asleep at the switch," failing to oversee his own staff, and called his conduct "disgraceful". When the Republican election fraud was first revealed, McCotter suggested he would run as a write-in candidate. Instead, he resigned from the U.S. House suddenly last month and announced he would not be seeking re-election. At the same time, as The BRAD BLOG detailed yesterday, Michigan's extraordinary partisan Republican Sec. of State Ruth Johnson, has been continuing her witch hunt against "non-citizen" voter fraud criminals, even if the effort keeps legitimate citizen voters from voting and/or having their ballots counted. As Steven Rosenfeld noted at Alternet, in covering the felony indictments of McCotter's staffers, "A Republican congressman and his 'dysfunctional' staffers are now Exhibit A for election fraud in Michigan. There is not a single Democrat involved."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344872471000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 11:41:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344873192000-26</Id><Topic><Title>Romney/ Ryan ???

CHICAGO 10 Shot in 24 Hours Ten people were wounded by gunfire in a handful of robberies and other attacks across the South and West sides on Friday and Saturday, police said. An 18-year-old was shot in the chest during a driveby shooting in the Pilsen neighborhood on the West Side and is in critical condition atJohn H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County, police said. Police were called about 3:10 a.m. to the scene in the 1900 block of South Morgan Street after receiving a report of a person being shot and found a crowd surrounding the victim who was laying on the sidewalk. Witnesses on the scene told police they observed a red Ford Explorer driving southbound on Morgan with approximately 4-5 people inside. Witnesses heard gunshots coming from the vehicle, which fled westbound on Cullerton Street. Witnesses told police they heard someone inside the Explorer shouting gang slogans. The victim doesn't have any documented gang affiliations, police said. A 15-year-old boy was taken to a nearby hospital after being shot in the leg on the South Side early Saturday morning, police said. While walking east on at East 93rd Street and Anthony Street in the Calumet Heights neighborhood at 12:45 a.m., the boy was approached by a 19- to 25-year-old man with dreadlocks. The man flashed a blue steel semiautomatic gun and told the boy to "give me everything you have."</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344874975000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:22:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344875517000-28</Id><Topic><Title>New Superpac forms to defend Rumney's vp pick</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1344869900000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 10:58:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what have you been smoking? republcons are for screwing america into the ground. bush jr all over again!!IMHO</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1344875517000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:31:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344875917000-29</Id><Topic><Title>$3.00/$4.00 at most lil'sis of Lehman Bros</Title><Username>nurse26yrs</Username><Timestamp>1344868810000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 10:40:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Silly one, this is NOT like Lehman Bros in any significant way other than both have to due, ultimately, with dealing securities and moving money.

Here then, as a public service, is a quick round-up of many (but by no means all!) of the high profile cases, most of which --- ironically enough, and unlike imaginary cases of "Democratic voter fraud" --- you probably have not have even heard about... • MITT ROMNEY: Last Summer, long-shot GOP candidate Fred Karger filed a complaint with Massachusetts officials charging that the now presumptive GOP nominee for President of the United was illegally registered to vote in his son's unfinished basement in Belmont, MA, despite having moved out of the state several years earlier. The release of Romney's 2010 federal tax returns did little to dispel the concern. Romney failed to include his state returns in his release (or those from 2009) which would likely show, as Karger detailed, Romney was not a resident of Massachusetts at the time he voted for Scott Brown in the January 2010 U.S. Senate special election to fill the seat of the late Ted Kennedy. Romney, who had houses in CA and NH, did not, in fact, own a house in MA until July of 2010 (in anticipation of another Presidential run), despite the fact that state law defines residency as "where a person dwells and which is the center of his domestic, social, and civil life." Residents in Belmont, MA, told Karger that neither he nor his wife had been seen in the town since selling their mansion and moving out of state years earlier.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344877652000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:07:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344877722000-36</Id><Title>gop want a prince &amp; a queen</Title><Msg>gop hates the "little people" described by Leona helmsley. gop social darwinism results in an aristocracy, prince Mittens and queen ryan.... who like other royals are so special they don't have to pay income tax: The Queen and The Prince of Wales are not subject to tax, and of course in the good old days George the 3rd certainly did not pay any taxes.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1344877722000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:08:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344877914000-37</Id><Topic><Title>Pick a direction for America</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344876997000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:56:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>America will finally vote out the rule the rich and their social darwinism, and when Obama begins his 2nd term, i hope you will just shut up and stop your whining because you are right, the nation will have chosen the path and you should get in line and stop trying to wreck the USA.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1344877914000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:11:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>29</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344878046000-38</Id><Topic><Title>Corrective Pattern Around The Corner</Title><Username>lyndseynnm602</Username><Timestamp>1344859947000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 08:12:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice Post</Msg><Username>selineqwv841</Username><Timestamp>1344878046000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:14:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344878108000-39</Id><Topic><Title>Voter ID laws simply GOP voter suppression</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344745665000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 00:27:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>• INDIANA SEC.

(The same thing that Romney appears to have done, as noted above.) Prior to that, in a separate civil case, White was ordered immediately removed from office by a circuit court judge who found that his fraudulent registration made him ineligible to be on the ballot when he was elected in 2010 in the first place. Ironically enough, Indiana was the very first state in the nation, in 2008, to institute polling place Photo ID restrictions, despite being unable to cite a single instance of in-person voter fraud in state history. Those restrictions, however, failed to keep White himself, the state's top election official, from committing voter fraud.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344878108000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:15:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344878544000-40</Id><Topic><Title>Pick a direction for America</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344876997000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:56:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What part of this shared prosperity are you two dopes looking forward to, and who's pile of chips will you be helping yourself to gain this new utopia?</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344878544000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:22:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344878610000-41</Id><Topic><Title>My neighborhood odumbomites</Title><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1344457137000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 16:18:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're just sol then.

The fraud appears to have been identical to what McCotter's staffers have now been charged with in Michigan, as explained in the article above. Gingrich was video-taped late last year by CNN claiming to a supporter in Iowa, after failing to qualify for the ballot with 10,000 valid signatures: "We turned in 11,100 --- we needed 10,000 --- 1,500 of them were by one guy who, frankly, committed fraud." That, while Gingrich had joined with fellow Republicans over the years in falsely charging the community group ACORN with similar crimes. In fact, what Gingrich's campaign did in Virginia, if his own admission is accurate, appears far worse than anything ACORN has ever done. They had actually been the ones, in most cases, to have identified the fraud by a handful of their workers when verifying the validity of voter registrations before turning them all in --- as required by law --- to officials. Gingrich, on the other hand, appears to have either failed to validate signatures before turning them or, unlike ACORN, appears to have failed to turn in the guilty parties to law enforcement once the fraud was discovered. • SACRAMENTO, CA REPUBLICAN PARTY: In May of this year, it was discovered that Momentum Political Services, hired by the Sacramento GOP to carry out their voter registration campaign for Rep. Dan Lungren, had turned in thousands of fraudulent voter registrations. It was the same thing Republicans claim ACORN did, though in their case, it was ACORN who notified officials about the fraudulent signatures. In this case, it was the actual organization led by a "professional con artistic" and hired by the GOP, who carried out a $50,000 "bounty" scheme for Republican-only registrations. The scheme was very similar, if not identical, to the one carried out by Young Political Majors in 2008, when the state Republican Party hired the group for their registration campaign that year. In that case, the head of Young Political Majors ended up pleading guilty to voter registration fraud convictions, after being arrested just prior to the 2008 Presidential election, when the GOP and Fox "News" and John McCain were telling you, 24/7, that there was an ACORN "voter fraud" epidemic occuring. (There wasn't.) • SEN. RICHARD LUGAR: Last February, the long-serving Senator from Indiana was accused of doing exactly what his state's Sec. of State Charlie White was tossed out of office for --- not living at the address where he was registered to vote. In this case, the allegations came from Tea Party supporters of Richard Mourdock who defeated the popular Lugar to become this year's U.S. Senate nominee. They charged that Lugar had been registered at a house where he had not lived since 1977. As in White's case, Indiana's First-in-the-Nation polling place Photo ID law failed deter any fraudulent voting by the erstwhile Senator.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344879665000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:41:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344879922000-48</Id><Title>Just wondering?</Title><Msg>"Why does Mitt Romney always look like he is wearing "Wrangler Jeans Women's Collection?

TODD AKIN: Speaking of U.S. Senate candidates, the one nominated earlier this week by the Missouri Republican Party to face Claire McCaskill this November has, as reported by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch last year, been voting for years from a property outside of his own Congressional district where he does not live. The charges echoes those against Romney, Lugar and White. Akin's house, as the paper found at the time, was vacant and long-scheduled for suburban re-development. Still, the Congressman has continued to use it as his voting address for some seven elections, ever since the time that he and his family moved to their new house in a different town some 18 miles away. • JON HUNTSMAN: In March of 2011, the then GOP Presidential hopeful was also identified as possibly having committed voter fraud. In his case, the former Governor remained registered to vote at the Executive Mansion in Utah well over a year after he had become the U.S. ambassador to China. As the Salt Lake Tribune noted at the time: "Huntsman voted by absentee ballot for last year’s general election using the state-owned mansion on South Temple as his Utah residence — months after Gov. Gary Herbert settled into the historic building and Huntsman purchased a home in Washington, D.C."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344882467000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:27:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344882527000-61</Id><Title>Rochester, Rochester</Title><Msg>Yessa, yessa.

A Republican Mayor in the Granite State called for O'Keefe and his co-conspirators to be "arrested and prosecuted". A petition with more than 100,000 signatures was submitted earlier this year to the state Attorney General calling for an investigation of O'Keefe on charges of voter fraud. • CHARLIE WEBSTER: In what appears to have been an attempt at massive election fraud, the Chairman of the Maine Republican Party, publicly announced Mitt Romney as the winner of the 2012 GOP Caucuses there, by just 194 votes, long before hundreds of voters in two different counties had even met to vote. At the same time, dozens of towns which had already held caucuses were fraudulently reported by the party as having had no voters at all. Several months earlier, Webster had named hundreds of legal students voters as having committed voter fraud, when they hadn't. An investigation by the Republican Sec. of State in Maine found they were, in fact, legal voters, though he, nonetheless, sent them threatening letters in apparent hopes of intimidating them from casting their legal votes in Maine in the future.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344883412000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:43:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344883573000-67</Id><Topic><Title>My neighborhood odumbomites</Title><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1344457137000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 16:18:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Returnus complains about his neighbors because they all have better trailers.</Msg><Username>monsewer_america</Username><Timestamp>1344883573000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 14:46:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344884754000-68</Id><Title>Suddenly dysfunctional people have "bipolar disorder"</Title><Msg>100% of people with "bipolar disorder" are drug and/or alcohol addicts.</Msg><Username>union_dude255</Username><Timestamp>1344884754000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 15:05:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344885585000-69</Id><Topic><Title>Just wondering?</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344879922000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 13:45:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>q4dike, &lt;&lt;&lt;Why does Mitt Romney always look like he is wearing "Wrangler Jeans Women's Collection?"&gt;&gt;&gt; Because he was a cheerleader just like Dubja.</Msg><Username>returnuspompus</Username><Timestamp>1344885585000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 15:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344885821000-70</Id><Topic><Title>The Secret to Finding today’s Best Stock Picks</Title><Username>mccormickbrady917</Username><Timestamp>1344859002000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 07:56:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I checked out those reports and i see what ur talking about now!

It should probably come as no surprise to anyone that someone like Paul Ryan would trade on inside information gained through his position as a congressman to line his pockets, but this particular instance is especially egregious. Ryan attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, Bush's Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on September 18, 2008. The purpose of the meeting was to disclose the coming economic meltdown and beg Congress to pass legislation to help collapsing banks. Instead of doing anything to help, Ryan left the meeting and on that very same day Paul Ryan sold shares of stock he owned in several troubled banks and reinvested the proceeds in Goldman Sachs, a bank that the meeting had disclosed was not in trouble. This is the guy Republicans want one heartbeat away from the presidency? He seems more than a little shady to me. Have a look at Ryan's financial disclosure form for 2008--you can click on each page to enlarge them.

MIAMI (AP) — Mitt Romney held a campaign event Monday evening at a Miami juice shop owned by a convicted cocaine trafficker. Romney appeared at El Palacio de los Jugos, which is owned by Reinaldo Bermudez. Court records show that Bermudez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in 1999 and served three years in federal prison. Appearing with Romney was Sen. Marco Rubio. Both men handed out juices to an excited crowd after making brief remarks. Romney was filming a campaign ad at the juice shop, aides said. In media reports in November 1997, Bermudez was identified as one of 12 people accused in a Colombian drug smuggling operation. The arrests followed a seven-month investigation led by the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Agents seized about 2,850 pounds of cocaine at three South Florida ports over several months. Agents first seized 430 pounds of cocaine at the Port of Palm Beach in July 1997 and then 117 pounds in late September at the Port of Miami. Those shipments were concealed in containers filled with fish imported from Trinidad, an island in the south Caribbean. The largest and final seizure came in late October at Port Everglades, where officials found 2,304 pounds of cocaine in a container of soap imported from Venezuela. Authorities learned of all three cocaine shipments through court-authorized wiretaps on four of the suspects' home, office and cellular telephones, according to media reports. As a convicted felon, Bermudez wouldn't be eligible to vote in Florida unless the governor and the Cabinet restore his rights. A phone call placed to the restaurant wasn't answered. The Romney campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. ... . .. . . .. . . . . News for You ». . . Judge keeps key documents sealed in Colorado shooting case.

Paul Ryan’s (R-Wis.) addition to the presidential ticket will cost their party House and Senate seats this fall. Their concern: Democrats will successfully demonize Ryan’s budget plan, which contains controversial spending cuts and changes to Medicare. “There are a lot races that are close to the line we're not going to win now because they're going to battle out who's going to kill grandma first, ObamaCare or Paul Ryan's budget,” said one Republican strategist who works on congressional races. “It could put the Senate out of reach. In the House it puts a bunch of races in play that would have otherwise been safe. ... It remains to be seen how much damage this causes, but my first blush is this is not good.” Many Republicans in tough races this year, especially in the House, voted for Ryan’s proposal, which makes it hard for them to distance themselves from it. And while Republicans are expected to keep the House, the more seats they lose, the closer the Democrats will be to a potential takeover in 2014. The Senate is too close to call; the GOP only needs to gain four seats (if President Obama wins reelection) to take control. A number of senior Republican House and Senate strategists, speaking anonymously so they could be candid about their party’s vice presidential pick, acknowledged Ryan was good for presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney but expressed concern about his effect on congressional races.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344915404000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:36:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344916774000-137</Id><Topic><Title>Today's NRA report</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344889854000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 16:30:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"A Facebook page belonging to Caffall features several photos of assault rifles, including a Czech-made version of the AK-47. On the page, Caffall identified himself as divorced, with “Christian” religious beliefs. He lists a series of snipers, including Carlos Hathcock and Vasily Zaytsev, as "inspirational people." “I am pulling a cross between Forrest Gump and Jack Kerouac (without the drugs),” Caffall wrote on the site. “I'm on the road, permanently.” Caffall commented on Facebook about several recent gun purchases, including a vintage Russian rifle. “I just got a new toy,” he wrote in May 2011. “I’ll be at the gun range as much as I can.” Weaver, his mother, said she had been estranged from her son over the past several months. She said he had not visited her after she became seriously ill. "We are just devastated,” Weaver said. “He's been very deeply troubled." She added that she was horrified at the loss of life. "If you're going to commit suicide, why take all these other people with you?" she said. In an interview with KPRC, a local television station, Caffall’s stepfather, Richard Weaver, said Caffall was a “ticking time bomb” who quit his job nine months ago and vowed never to work again. "He was crazy as hell," Weaver said. "At one point, we were afraid that he was going to come up here and do something to his mother and me."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344916774000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:59:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
