You seem to forget that, as Rowdy states, "we are entitled to our opinions without name calling or profanity. I've talked to many young and old veterans who experienced com- bat and all of them have seen so much misery that weapons and explosives can create on both sides. Combat vets want less weapons in private hands, especially assault weapons. I don't know of anyone who doesn't approve of a handgun in your home to protect your family and your property, but walking around with a gun strapped to your side is so cowboyish. Also, people who experienced or were victims of WW2 and all of the wars thereafter want nothing to do with any weapons. It is by far too easy to buy weapons of any type or category. Did George Zimmerman need to carry a gun in a gated community? A stungun would have been a better option. I think Zimmerman wanted to be a big cowboy. Far too many gun permits have been issued to persons who don't need them. Ciefs of Police and Sheriffs issue permits to politicians and "good" friends. Background checks also leave something to be dsired and this why unstable persons are able to obtain gun permits. I totally disagree with those who post 'if I would have been there when Gaby Gifford was shot, or in the case of Aurrora, I would have shot and killed the guy with my handgun. Not so fast, buddy - you could have missed and killed someone else.</Msg><Username>oldtimer60</Username><Timestamp>1342988276000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 16:17:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342989646000-25</Id><Topic><Title>Weary of assault gun massacres</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1342845053000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-21 00:30:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>coulda woulda shoulda.....bottom line is....regulation will never stop the criminal intent...it gives them the upper hand instead.........</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1342989646000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 16:40:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342990392000-26</Id><Topic><Title>Does the 2nd Amend Allow for Nukes ???</Title><Username>chuckiedamanson</Username><Timestamp>1342971265000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 11:34:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>slayer, &lt;&lt;&lt;I know you want to see only criminals and your friendly government carry weapons.

"If you say to your tax people, as he seems to have done, 'I want every trick in the book. I want to push this to the edge,'" Rattner said during an appearance on "Fareed Zakaria GPS" on CNN. "I will tell you that as a private equity guy, I'm familiar with many of the things that he did. And I know many people who have done many of the things that he did. I do not know anyone who did everything that he did." "Some of what he did, like the IRA, I have asked fellow private equity guys," Rattner said, referencing the account in which Romney has stored up to $100 million tax-free. "None of us had even known this was a possible trick, if you will. He has pushed the envelope all the way to the edge, to his benefit, and I think that Americans would find that pretty distasteful." Romney has declined to release multiple years' worth of tax returns, disclosing only those from 2010 and estimates from 2011. Rattner called Romney overly secretive Sunday, speculating that he was attempting to hide more instances of using innovative and questionable accounting tricks. Rattner, who hails from the world of private equity, has occasionally served as a voice of sympathy for Romney as his business career has come under heavy attack. His comments, then, carry a bit more weight than the average criticism from an Obama ally."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343002386000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:13:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343002895000-50</Id><Topic><Title>THEE place for pup tents</Title><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1298756806000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-02-26 16:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the spring of 1996 at least 30 separate expeditions were attempting to climb Everest.</Msg><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1343002895000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:21:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343002985000-51</Id><Topic><Title>THEE place for pup tents</Title><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1298756806000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-02-26 16:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the last week I talked with people from India, China, the U.S., Albania, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Ukraine, Mexico and probably more.</Msg><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1343002985000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:23:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343003015000-52</Id><Topic><Title>THEE place for pup tents</Title><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1298756806000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-02-26 16:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A fine word: Sword</Msg><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1343003015000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:23:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343003042000-53</Id><Topic><Title>THEE place for pup tents</Title><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1298756806000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-02-26 16:46:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I did an about an hour flat out today.</Msg><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1343003042000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:24:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343003059000-54</Id><Topic><Title>Willard's " magic IRA"</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343002386000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what the fk do you expect...be a ricky retardo and not play the loopholes the geniuses alowed in the first place...romney would be a fool as would others not to take advantage of it.....gd jb...tax reform is what it's all about...what is it asshats like you cannot grasp about it</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1343003059000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:24:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343003491000-55</Id><Title>Does Obama Kasasa?</Title><Msg>I heard the Obama savings account used to have $100.

More than a dozen studies have been done comparing economic growth, unemployment, average length of unemployment, stock market performance, inflation, federal debt, and other economic indicators, during Democratic and Republican presidencies and congresses, and they all show stunningly better performance when Democrats are in power, than when Republicans are. These studies are all available online, and they are all summarized and discussed in this path-breaking book, which settles, once and for all, the question of whether there’s any significant economic difference between the two Parties. Not only is there a difference, but – shockingly – it always runs in favor of Democrats in power. There might be other types of reasons for voting Republican, but all of the economic reasons favor voting for Democrats. Regarding economic performance, the two Parties aren’t even close.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1343006385000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 21:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343006502000-58</Id><Topic><Title>Willard's " magic IRA"</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343002386000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 20:13:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yip, just like homercrats weren't gonna take a shellacking in 2010 and just like Walker's recall was gonna be 'too close to call.'

Or maybe he'd just use a pistol instead of an AR-15 and only killed a couple of people instead of 12, whose lives as you pointed out, can't be replaced.</Msg><Username>briguy260</Username><Timestamp>1343009321000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 22:08:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343010298000-63</Id><Topic><Title>Does the 2nd Amend Allow for Nukes ???</Title><Username>chuckiedamanson</Username><Timestamp>1342971265000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 11:34:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe he'd be even more detered if he knew some of the theater crowd were packing....since big brother makes it hard for a law abiding citizen to do the nut knew the odds were in his favor he'd be king of the day...</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1343010298000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 22:24:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343010983000-64</Id><Topic><Title>Does the 2nd Amend Allow for Nukes ???</Title><Username>chuckiedamanson</Username><Timestamp>1342971265000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 11:34:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The shooter was completely outfitted in body armor and armed with an assault rifle and shotgun, doubt if some redneck with a pistol would scare him.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343010983000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 22:36:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343011144000-65</Id><Topic><Title>Does the 2nd Amend Allow for Nukes ???</Title><Username>chuckiedamanson</Username><Timestamp>1342971265000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 11:34:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/explosives-removed-from-james-holmess-apartment-and-destroyed-officials-say/2012/07/22/gJQAL9XN2W_story.html</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343011144000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 22:39:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343011399000-66</Id><Topic><Title>McCain's research on Willard</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343008788000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 21:59:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gay Rights  Romney endorsed Rep.

Now, with the growing imbroglio over his secret tax returns, labyrinthine overseas accounts and "I win even when they lose" Bain business model, Mitt Romney increasingly reminds Americans of the guys who destroyed their economy. Which is why Romney and his compliant right-wing water carriers have launched an all-out counterattack. "This idea of criticizing and attacking success, of demonizing those in all walks of life who have been successful," Romney charged in his new favorite double sound bite, "is so foreign to us we simply can't understand it." Washington Post columnist Robert Samuelson accused President Obama of "character assassination" and of being a "distributionalist" who takes economic growth for granted to pursue his policy of "redistributing the bounty of a wealthy society." And in the New York Times, David Brooks lamented that the "big government" Obama "challenges the entire logic of capitalism as it has existed over several decades." But theirs is a grave--and willful--misreading of President Obama's critique. Obama isn't demonizing anyone's success, but instead condemning the Republican Party's proven record of economic failure for the American people. And simply put, Obama is right. As the historical record shows, from economic growth and job creation to stock market performance and just about every other indicator of the health of American capitalism, the modern U.S. economy has almost always done better under Democratic presidents. Despite GOP mythology to the contrary, America generally gained more jobs and grew faster when taxes were higher (even much higher) and income inequality lower. While the U.S. recovery from the crippling Bush recession has been painfully slow, most economists - including the nonpartisan CBO and some of John McCain's own 2008 advisers - believe President Obama saved the American free-enterprise system from the abyss. And many economists are increasingly worried that businessman-turned-President Romney would lead the United States back into recession."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1343014704000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 23:38:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343014829000-72</Id><Title>Capital One</Title><Msg>I have this vision of COF buying etrade bank or the whole company at some point.
