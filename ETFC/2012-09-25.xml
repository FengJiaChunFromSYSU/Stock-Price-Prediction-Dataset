If the government wants to use that money to boost employment then just contract out the infrastructure jobs to regular construction companies, who'll then have to hire new workers, a large number of whom you'll find are veterans. That alone will have an effect. Instead the bill was going to restrict bidders to veteran owned (often a scam with the veteran owning the business only on paper) companies, or companies that employ large numbers of veterans in proportion to non-veterans; also including reporting and verification requirements, etc etc etc . . . . The costs of administering the program reduce the effectiveness of the government dollars spent on any given project by almost 50%. On the other hand reducing the VA's coverage to Priority 4 or less and eliminating the areas of coverage that are determined by income (making them not a veterans program but a wealth transfer program) rather than service status. That alone will undo most of the damage President Clinton did when he briefly opened up the VA system to everyone regardless of length or service or discharge status, and tripled the case load in less than 2 years. AFTER promising there would be a concomitant bill to transfer the balancing funds from Medicare, which of course never happened, since any bill touching Medicare funding wasn't EVER going to get any political support, something of which he was well aware when he gave the VA the order to start taking people based on income. Democratic Presidents tend to use their authority as Federal Executives to abuse agency law for the purpose of pursuing political agendas. Then again, Republicans aren't entirely immune from this either, they just usually wait and get Congress to do as they wish instead of signing an executive fiat that has a HUGE impact on an agencies ability to do its job. It would be like a Republican President signing an order requiring HUD housing to be changed from rental assistance and public housing to work houses and barracks.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1348587439710</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 11:37:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348587751841-11</Id><Topic><Title>gop killed a veterans jobs bill</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1348407494130</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-23 09:38:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i guess you missed that gop senators coauthored the bill and a few voted for it , and of course the veterans thought it was a good idea, but you and the gop first crowd only think about the 1%........... typical of your type , you are all for TRILLIONS UNFUNDED to send the troops to war but when it comes to $5 billion over 5 years for a vets jobs bill that is FUNDED, you screww the vets to kiss gop party line rear end.</Msg><Username>hardwaregurufromtheheartland</Username><Timestamp>1348587751841</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 11:42:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348588329879-12</Id><Title>Mitt's miracle medicare remedy &amp; all purpose snake oil</Title><Msg>elect Mitt and medicare goes from near broke to GOOD to GO , AS IS, NO CHANGE, for most of the boomers who will be on it out into the 2040s......... and we all get tax cuts ! and defense spending will be increased! and the deficit will be reduced! don't ask how all THAT works, you just have to "trust Mitt".</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1348588329879</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 11:52:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348589032517-13</Id><Title>Obamaâ€™s policies are actually bad for the underdogs and minorities.</Title><Msg>" The notion that big government helps the poor is a false one.

Another is failing to vote FOR a veterans appropriations bill no matter HOW inefficient it might be. Thanks, as much as that program might have helped me as the new straw owner of a number of local construction companies, I would rather the government spent the money more efficiently all around rather than inefficiently to my benefit. There are already plenty of other veterans preferences in government contracts. As well as tax breaks for businesses hiring recently discharged veterans, the modern educational assistance program is MUCH more generous than when I was active duty, and now they actually recognize PTSD rather than writing it off as a failure to adjust to civilian life . . . so we've got a few advantages already. An unemployed veterans is either, like me, too disabled to be employed in anything but a high executive position where mostly what he does is think, scheme, and plot; or he simply doesn't want to work, or he is so messed up no employers will have him. Now, if he's so messed up others won't have him but shows an exemplary service record followed by, in particular, multiple traumatic combat experiences, or simply one horrifying one, followed by a period of dysfunction in military life, that's a clear cut case for PTSD that if documented would result in 100% disability due to being unemployable, and that's on top of any other PTSD related disability levels (disability levels are semi logarithmically calculated using a table and rounding system rather than an equation most people wouldn't understand, me probably included). That means a minimum of around $2500 a month tax free. Don't think that if we get screwed up, mentally or physically, the government fails to see to our economic needs. Writing a check is, after all, fairly easy. Where the VA falls short is in the quality and availability of health services, and that's LARGELY because almost two thirds of the health budget is wasted on veterans who before Clinton wouldn't have even been eligible for VA care in most circumstances, as well as non-veterans who have become covered under some of the lower categories (5-8) rather than the higher ones (1-4) which were, when I entered the VA system, the ONLY categories of veterans the VA would treat. Clinton signed his order (since rescinded but veterans already admitted to the program were allowed to continue on it) because he felt the declining World War II population would ease the demand on resources, and to an extent he was right. However that overcapacity was designed into the system as a matter of prior policy in case we become involved in another war (wars often happen unexpectedly, certainly without enough warning to build a network of hospital and rehab facilities it will require), which we did . . . and now that used up overcapacity has a demand on it that requires a GREAT expansion of the VA healthcare system. If you want to stimulate the economy via government spending, do that, and they WILL hire veterans, most VA regional centers far prefer them to civilians. In addition there would be construction of new facilities, new PERMANENT employees in the VA. And; Bonus, a need currently unaddressed will be met, without having to kick the category 1-8 servicemen and women out of the system.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1348593132107</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 13:12:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348593274331-18</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt's miracle medicare remedy &amp; all purpose snake oil</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1348588329879</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 11:52:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes - trust Mitt - he has nothing to hide.......... - well..... maybe few tax shenanigans, few foreign tax-heaven accounts.... few uncool business transactions..... a couple of misstated fillings..... his family history..... his magic underwear..... but other than that - honestly - you can trust Mitt ................... to have several opinions (two completely opposing) on every topic ever raised....</Msg><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1348593274331</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 13:14:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348593920763-19</Id><Title>$9.30+++ is coming tomorrow...

Sub $8 isn't likely. Current valuations of the company are WAY too low. Particularly if you're looking at the Treflis (?) reports. Their so called model changed ETFC so much during one quarter they made a significant chop in their reported price without any change in the forecast numbers from eTrade, just off their own guesses. So, I guess it comes down to whose guesses I trust, some guy who may, or may not, have a nose for businesses and how they work who has, at least, a slightly above average IQ, but who has to cover multiple companies churning out reports on each so often he doesn't have time to examine the nuances, or me, who, in reverse order spends more time researching, has been intimately involved in two start ups, created an accounting system for the largest lab at MIT, and was offered assistance-ships by my matriculating University by three different graduate programs, and has an IQ high enough that in one sample of about 1000 people only ONE out scored me on a general aptitude test, and that only by a small margin. (I had access briefly to the TO&amp;E records for my Cavalry Squadron). I've held two primary combat MOS's, one secondary combat MOS, and one secondary non-combat MOS in my short military career because I train incredibly quickly and could be slotted into ANY role within the squadron where a body was needed. As an E3 I held positions usually calling for anything from an E4, a rank I eventually attained after graduating from advanced demo school, to E6 as commander of a main battle tank. Of course I was bench warming so when a qualified NCO become available I gave my tank up, but they trusted me with it (they moved me to an E5 slot at HQ as an attaboy), which was rather flattering (I did so much better in the job than the E5 who was actually army trained for it that I won one of the first Army Achievement Awards, downgraded from an Army Commendation Medal because the Army wanted some of the new awards out there quickly so people would get used to seeing them). The point is I learn bloody fast and I've been trading since before the turn of the century. I don't see much downside in this company absent conditions that would be disastrous for the economy as a whole. The ONE thing that the market is reacting too , and eTrade and other financials along with it, is the election cycle and the possibility of the re-election of President Obama. If he stays in office then the market will tank for awhile. If he manages to improve the economy then we'll have a gradual recovery of our market cap. If he over-regulates the industry, then $8 may be overpriced, but I'm hoping he won't be that dumb. If Romney is elected we'll see an IMMEDIATE pump in the stock market, but, as he WILL fail to produce instant results, it will be a temporary boost followed by a trail-off selling period until the real recovery starts. Admittedly it may start sooner under Romney and not be in as much danger of being snuffed out by government insanities, but no matter who gets elected we will either have a recovery, or chaos, and if its chaos I have an entirely different portfolio.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1348598874754</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 14:47:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348599163082-24</Id><Topic><Title>$8.86 is coming tomorrow...

That spending cannot continue, so those jobs WILL go away, hence they really don't count. Romney OTOH attracted business to MA by lowering businesses tax burden, which in turn increased local tax bases, which increased net revenues which allowed the state to keep its head above water despite recent overspending. It's called "trickle down" economics, and it really DOES work, but only if what you're producing with your economic activity generates wealth. Government spending dissipates wealth rather than creating it, which is why Obama's world is flawed by one of his most basic assumptions, that more government is better government.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1348600148858</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 15:09:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348600478599-30</Id><Topic><Title>$8.86 is coming tomorrow...

Are we sure someone who is essentially defrauding we taxpayers should be given credibility. In fact, aren't we honor bound to rat him out ? A citizenry that just shrugs off abuse of well intentioned Gv't programs is complicit in the fraud. And it leads to a bigger concept, Gv't can't succeed if the citizenry insists on treating it as the enemy. Look no farther than Italy,Greece, Spain and Portugal whose populations for generations treated "dodge the taxman ' as the national sport.

John McCain has said President Bush's tax cuts have increased federal revenues. But revenues would have been even higher without them. Summary Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain has said that the major tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003 have "increased revenues." He also said that tax cuts in general increase revenues. Thatâ€™s highly misleading. In fact, the last half-dozen years have shown us that we can't have both lower taxes and fatter government coffers. The Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation, the White Houseâ€™s Council of Economic Advisers and a former Bush administration economist all say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been â€“ even if they spur some economic growth. And federal revenues actually declined at the beginning of this decade before rebounding. The growth in the past three years that McCain refers to brings revenues back in line with the 40-year historical average as a percentage of gross domestic product. fact check</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1348613246237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 18:47:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348614602017-50</Id><Title>Fire some more dead weight</Title><Msg>Get rid of more of the dead weight management!

Hey, Wisconsin, What Do You Think of Union-Busting Now? Last edited Tue Sep 25, 2012, 03:37 PM USA/ET - Edit history (4) Scott Walker is a union buster. So are the owners in the NFL. Let's just review what this job action is about. The NFL Refs are not on strike, they are locked out. That's a big difference. They don't want anything more than they have, they just don't want to lose what they already have and have been promised through the years. The NFL makes billions and their brand hinges on the integrity of the game. The Refs safe guard that integrity, and a pension is a small item in securing that integrity. Now you can see how important experience and competence is at such a high level, pressure job. Last night's game was just an example of what football fans from all over America are going through. Sunday night, we here in Boston went through a similar evening. Our owner, Bob Kraft, is one of the biggest culprits in all of this. He's been an anti-union maggot in everything he does (he built "Patriot Place" with non-union labor). His son, Jonathan, is worse than he is. Now, I know that 35% of my union brothers and sisters voted for Scott Walker in his recall. I know that was more than the margin of victory. I also know that if Scott Walker was removed from office, it would have had no baring on last night's game. However, the dispute between the NFL owners and the NFL Refs is a perfect example of a very rich corporation that makes billions doesn't want to share a small portion of that profit with some of those that are responsible for helping to create that profit. Last night, that point was brought home, vividly, to the people of Wisconsin, and the irony should not be lost on anyone.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1348626568188</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 22:29:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348627574869-58</Id><Title>There is no evidence that Obama stimulates economic growth</Title><Msg>The people grow tired of empty promises.</Msg><Username>redistribute_this</Username><Timestamp>1348627574869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 22:46:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348629160685-59</Id><Topic><Title>There is no evidence that Obama stimulates economic growth</Title><Username>redistribute_this</Username><Timestamp>1348627574869</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 22:46:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But his poll ratings are getting better and better.
