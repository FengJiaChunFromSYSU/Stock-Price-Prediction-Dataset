Meanwhile those billionaires are pumping more than enough into the system to support those individuals plus a few million more.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1362301912395</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 04:11:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362339918146-2</Id><Topic><Title>GOP does it again</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1362281852825</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 22:37:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Heck, you're so edumacated!!! Ronald Reagan was speaking about CRA decades ago when it used to have a real voice. CA GOP is virtually invisible today. Current Republican representation of California state assembly has 1/3rd of the one of Republican representation of little state of Wisconsin. But, that's not the point. You tell me you knew who Celeste Greig was before this big news pulled out by left wing apparatchiks, I will trell you, you lie through your teeth. I live in the state for decades. Never even heard her name. So, how does she represents GOP as a whole with such "large" name recognition? The women is most likely correct, she knows what she is talking about. But GOP is mute on this issue, as it should be until all the facts are widely available and delivered in a proper form to uneducated public. What your party is doing today is a bunch of filthy tricks and misinformation to scare the hack of under informed voter away from GOP. Does Harry Reid have a voice? Yes, the doofus has a big voice in your party. When he told us that MItt didn't pay taxes for 10 years, did you try to correct him? Did you tell him it is a lie, it is impossible for someone who served as Governor in this decade and was vetted from head to toe? NOOOOO! You cheered! Dirty little #$%$, ruining a great country of ours. Cockroaches.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1362339918146</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 14:45:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362351050697-3</Id><Topic><Title>top 400 rich fat cats make more than all 4 million people on min wage</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1362252174981</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 14:22:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I’ve been there. Minimum wage. Making all kinds of dirty work: washing, cleaning, digging, painting.You name it. Happened at different times of my life, "between jobs". Some relatively recent. What’s important, after just few months of minimal wage I got 10% raise as reward for consistency and work ethic. I tried a lot. This is why I rarely go to car shops for maintenance. I do it myself, not because I am poor, because I can. I’ve made it all possible to move to higher income and succeeded every time. My son, currently in college, was working for min wage rate since he was 16. Really think he is stuck in there forever? So, how often when you enter “Starbucks”, “Subway”, “McDonalds” or “Domino Pizza” you are greeted with 35 years old adult? I can’t recall a single instance. Why? It is rare. What BLS doesn’t tell me is how long those over 20 are staying on min wage regardless of their degree of education. A year? 2 years? Did they find a better salary after? None of that is there. So, go back, read my previous post. I don’t believe anyone in this country spends most time of their lives on minimum wage. They either move up the scale or go back laying on the couch. I am saying that from my personal experience, doofus. I don’t care about statistics. People are not statistics, they want to live better, and in this country more than anywhere else in the world they can accomplish their dreams, you just need to have them.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1362351050697</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 17:50:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362353111806-4</Id><Topic><Title>Top GOP donor admits to bribery</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1362337831502</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 14:10:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And what in the world it has to do with Sheldon Adelson?
