In 1982 we had a new version of the TOW missile to equip our troops, but we didn't have the budget to replace the ENTIRE stock of TOW for Improved TOW, so we SOLD about a quarter of our stock at HORRIBLY inflated prices to Iran because the Iraqi''s had been making significant gains, and while we didn't want the Iranians to win we didn't want Iraq to win either. Essentially we wanted a standoff where they threw their troops to the wire again and again to make no ground (Think WWI) and instead we had the Iraqi's threatening an armor breakout. So, we sold our enemies weapons to kill our enemies at a massive profit, then we took that principle, used it to replace the original TOW missiles with ITOW systems, and then took the profit and diverted to certain friends in Central America, thus accomplishing several goals with ONE action. If THAT is all you have to criticize about the Reagan Presidency you're off base, as a foreign policy initiative the sale of TOW missiles to Iran was brilliant.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1367052413890</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 04:46:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367067106261-3</Id><Topic><Title>We named the airport in our national capital for a man who sold weapons stolen from Pentagon warehouses to Ayatollah Khomeini</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1366982802422</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 09:26:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice how you rationalize our murder and meddling in the Mideast. And yes Reagan aided saddam and the Ayatolloh, and both were on the terrorist list. And neither were a threat to the USA. but then you think the mid east and its oil resources are part of the USA I guess, and hence your pathehetic justification of murder and meddling for oil companies. Why are you surprised that decades of murder and meddling in the Mideast result in blow back? Why do you whine about the costs of homeland security and shampoo searches at the airport? The French learned the lesson in Vietnam and Algeria and we still plod on with our murder and meddling and now we get most of our oil from Canada.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1367067106261</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 08:51:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367068437810-4</Id><Topic><Title>Blast in West, Texas</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1366739468541</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:51:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Excellent reporting, Pacifican.</Msg><Username>sailorbum_94536</Username><Timestamp>1367068437810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 09:13:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367070739370-5</Id><Title>Our corporate leaders have made their employees better off?</Title><Msg>( the middleclass is making more now than then, right?

Communists are socialists who believe, like Islamists, that the entire world is going to "come around" to their way of thinking even if they must use force to make it so. Because I don't think ANYONE telling me what to believe much less forcing me to, I must therefore object to both groups. Because I VIOLENTLY object to both groups as I violently object to anyone without cause telling me what to do, I simply kill self avowed communists and Islamists if they come up to me and say something like "You must do 'X' because I said so and I'll kill ya if you don't. Some with any other group claiming to have a monopoly on the truth and threatening to impose their version of reality on me at the cost of my freedom. Obama's promises have NOTHING to do with it. He is, as far as I can tell, a socialist and NOT a communist, further NO ONE with any sense expects a Presidential Candidate to keep all his promises. His promises involve what he intends to do that's within his power, but in truth he must work through a SYSTEM to attempt to accomplish anything. Since many of Obama's promises involved the cooperation of Congress, and since he lost that cooperation in short order, it's not surprising they've gone unfulfilled. He can only unilaterally do things in his power like close Gitmo, withdraw from the Middle East, etc, etc, etc. Further he CAN'T unilaterally change who can and can't stay in this country. e.g. HE HIMSELF has to follow the rules that Congress has set, where they've set any, for the operation of INS. NOT change their mission with a simple executive order. So yes, we have Obama doing what is illegal for him to do what in order to deliver on a promise, and not doing what he said he would despite his ability to do it legally on his own because he realizes finally that all he'd be doing is giving the IslamoWacks a national platform for their agenda.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1367080033324</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 12:27:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367080365981-10</Id><Topic><Title>I have communists under by bed, and probably in the closet too</Title><Username>investorpelvis</Username><Timestamp>1367079886739</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 12:24:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>did I mention that I also can't use my garage as I am pretty sure it is full of Muslims who are about to impose sharia law.

I'm concerned with actual material results, not appearances of impropriety. Do you hear me crowing for Obama's impeachment over what some might regard as an overly aggressive drone campaign? Oops, guess not . . . Unlike someone who have to have their opinions issued from a central office, I tend to form my own. So not only am I not calling for Obama's impeachment for allowing our national defense establish to drone suspected terrorists, I'd probably be more upset if he didn't. Further I think his not closing Gitmo was the only wise move he could have made once someone actually explained the implications of a US civilian trial to a man with a law degree who's never really practiced law in his life. Also I agreed with Obama on another controversial decision, but that one is still classified, so I'll leave it unstated, but, have you noticed how the Russians have shut up about our missile defense plans despite our NOT canceling the central European missile sites? So far President Obama has done NOTHING worthy of impeachment. Not even close.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1367082970707</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 13:16:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367083732940-13</Id><Topic><Title>Shooting every six hours</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1367001941904</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 14:45:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maroons like bidder are fact challenged.

Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead is asking the White House to disregard pressure from the governors of Washington and Oregon and refuse to evaluate the effects of greenhouse gases that would be emitted by exporting U.S. coal to Asia from ports in the Northwest. Mead announced Friday he has written to the White House's Council on Environmental Quality stating it would be inappropriate to analyze under the National Environmental Policy Act the effects of burning U.S. coal overseas. The NEPA law requires detailed analysis of the environmental effects of federal agency actions. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is reviewing three proposed port projects that would accommodate coal exports, one in Oregon and two in Washington. Wyoming is the nation's leading coal-producing state, and state officials are concerned about falling domestic demand for coal as a result of global warming concerns. State officials are pushing to secure ports in the Northwest to allow coal exports to Asia.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1367088380259</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 14:46:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367088442593-18</Id><Topic><Title>GOP promotes ignorance</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1367088380259</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-27 14:46:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"What the Wyoming Governor doesn't want people to know are the facts. At one point in time the Earth's atmosphere was toxic to most living things. It took hundreds of millions of years for the plants to filter the toxic carbon dioxide and monoxide out of the atmosphere allowing plants and animals to flourish. Hundreds of millions of years. This process sequestered the harmful elements into deposits within the earth. Once the atmosphere was breathable a process began that has culminated in this planet and its magnificent variety of life in all its aspects, another very long period of time from our prespective. The Big Blue Ball! What is happening now is we are taking the sequestered carbon out of the earth and spewing it back into the atmosphere. What took hundreds of millions of years will be undone, destroyed, in a relatively short period of time from whenever coal was massively mined for the "industrial revolution" to the end of our use of carbon fuels in the future. And maybe the end of our existence as well. We have a very narrow window of opportunity to alleviate this and at the risk of sounding defeatist, without the American People waking up to their responsibility in the Stewardship of this planet, we will probably fail.
