If you graduated in the top quarter of your class, we gave you a John and Abigail Adams scholarship—four years tuition-free to the college of your choice in Massachusetts that's a public institution. Four years tuition-free. You'd think that would be game, set, match—now these kids can afford college. But that's not the way it works in Massachusetts, and Romney knows this. At Massachusetts public colleges and universities, fees are much higher than tuition. Under Romney, those fees went up dramatically just as so many other fees did. He was planning to run for president, for Pete's sake, he couldn't admit he was raising tuition and taxes. Here's the reality (PDF): At the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, when the John and Abigail Adams scholarship was established in 2004, tuition was $1,714. That's how much it was in 1999, and that's how much it is this year. Fees, on the other hand, were $7,294 in 2004-2005 (up from $6,518 in 2003-2004, the year Romney took office, and a sharp increase from the $4,768 the year before he took office). The year Romney left office, fees were $7,881. That means that the scholarship program Romney is so proud of, the one he mentioned in the very first minutes of the debate, covered 19 percent of college costs the year it was established, and 17.8 percent the year he left office. And that's not even talking about room and board. It's not just UMass-Amherst, the flagship of the state system, either. Berkshire Community College? Tuition was and is frozen at $780. Fees went from $2,610 to $2,896. So the Adams scholarship went from covering 23 percent of costs to covering 21.2 percent of costs during Romney's tenure. Bridgewater State University? Tuition stayed at $910, while fees went from $4,416 to $4,956. The Adams scholarship dropped from 17 percent of costs to 15.5 percent. Again, not counting room and board. That's not the only way the program fails students: But research into the Adams Scholarship and the 12 others like it across the country suggests that these programs do little to improve college access because they typically go to students who already plan to attend college. If anything, these researchers say, the scholarships can widen existing income and racial gaps in college attendance. A study released this summer by Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government found that Massachusetts students were likely to use the scholarship to attend a state school with fewer resources than private schools they might have gone to otherwise. The result? Students who use the scholarship actually take longer to graduate—and they are less likely to graduate at all. This scholarship program is the crux of Mitt Romney's argument for himself on college costs. It's the only concrete thing he said about his own record in his discussion of helping young people afford college and get jobs. And it is so much less than advertised—maybe not quite a total sham, but damn close.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1350580109469</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 13:08:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350580686248-15</Id><Topic><Title>Who has the bigger public pension, Obama or Romney</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1350510016757</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 17:40:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As usual off point.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1350580686248</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 13:18:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350580739161-16</Id><Topic><Title>Another Dipshidiot deception</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1350580109469</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 13:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gee, and to think that all I had to do get get my tuition (only) paid was join the Ohio National Guard.

Obama sure can pickum. **Satcon is the second DOE-backed green energy company to declare bankruptcy this week** . Another DOE-Backed Solar Company Goes Bankrupt A solar company that got a multi-million-dollar grant from the Department of Energy earlier this year announced Wednesday that it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, making it the second taxpayer-backed green energy company to file for bankruptcy this week. Satcon Technology Corp. announced the decision in a Wednesday news release. “This has been a difficult time for Satcon,” president and CEO Steve Rhoades said. “After careful consideration of available alternatives, the Company’s Board of Directors determined that the Chapter 11 filings were a necessary and prudent step, allowing the Company to continue to operate while giving us the opportunity to reorganize with a stronger balance sheet and capital structure.” Satcon received a $3 million DOE grant in January to develop “a compact, lightweight power conversion device that is capable of taking utility-scale solar power and outputting it directly into the electric utility grid at distribution voltage levels—eliminating the need for large transformers.” Satcon has also received smaller federal payments for various solar initiatives at DOE. The company manufactures power conversion devices for solar energy, though it does not manufacture the solar panels themselves. Satcon is the second DOE-backed green energy company to declare bankruptcy this week. As Scribe’s Michael Sandoval reported on Tuesday, electric vehicle battery manufacturer A123 Systems filed for Chapter 11 despite receiving a $249 million DOE grant.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1350587513884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350587655275-26</Id><Topic><Title>Whoops, there goes another solar company</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1350587513884</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:11:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is really, really tough to keep up Dumbo's drunken spending (of OUR money) on Loser crapola 'New Coke' Green/Solar sheetholes!!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350587655275</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:14:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350588395280-27</Id><Topic><Title>GM -Goverment Motors moves jobs to CHINA!!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350586954527</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:02:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo's crapola company.</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350588395280</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:26:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350588433093-28</Id><Title>sold my long position after five</Title><Msg>long pain filled years.....lost 15 grand.......just sick of etfc on my screen...of course now that i sold etfc will go up....so good luck all longs.........hard to admit a loss but comes with the territory.......</Msg><Username>pgpgo</Username><Timestamp>1350588433093</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:27:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350588511660-29</Id><Topic><Title>GM -Goverment Motors moves jobs to CHINA!!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350586954527</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:02:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And that crapola Italian owned car company..Chrystler</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350588511660</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:28:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350589142219-30</Id><Title>Got some PDS at 8.32...</Title><Msg>but I haven't got a clue where it's going... tdc</Msg><Username>tradedotcom</Username><Timestamp>1350589142219</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:39:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350589166469-31</Id><Topic><Title>Stupid Dumbo Green: A123 Demcrat Super Donations</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350587332370</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:08:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bet they outsourced their jobs to China like Solyndra did, all the while wasting our TAX $$$.

This compares with net income of $40 million, or $0.14 per share in the prior quarter, and net income of $71 million, or $0.24 per share in the third quarter of 2011. The Company reported total net revenue of $490 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared with $452 million in the prior quarter and $507 million in the third quarter of 2011. "While this quarter's results were marked by some unique items, we made good progress on our deleveraging and cost reduction initiatives, and continued to improve our risk profile," said E*TRADE's Chairman and Interim CEO, Frank Petrilli. "We delivered on our strategic initiatives during the third quarter and executed well in our brokerage business, while continuing to manage down the loan portfolio. We have identified or completed over $4 billion of balance sheet reductions, which are critical to achieving our goal of distributing capital from the Bank to the Parent. Importantly, our core brokerage franchise continues to grow assets and accounts at healthy rates, despite lackluster investor engagement across the industry. During the first three quarters of the year, we have surpassed the full year 2011 in terms of net new accounts, aided by record account retention. We are making headway in the retirement and investing customer segment, ending the quarter with over $1 billion in managed accounts, less than three years after introducing the products. In addition, our management team is delivering against cost reduction initiatives, with a new target of $100 million in run-rate reductions to be completed by the end of 2013." E*TRADE reported DARTs of 129,000 during the quarter, a decrease of seven percent from the prior quarter and a decrease of 22 percent versus the same quarter a year ago. At quarter end, the Company reported 4.4 million customer accounts, which included 2.9 million brokerage accounts. Net new brokerage accounts were 18,000 during the quarter compared with 46,000 in the prior quarter and 13,000 in the third quarter of 2011. The Company ended the quarter with $204 billion in total customer assets, compared with $193 billion at the end of the second quarter and $160 billion from the year-ago period. During the quarter, customers added $1.9 billion in net new brokerage assets. Brokerage related cash increased by $3.4 billion to $32.6 billion during the period, as customers were net sellers of approximately $2.2 billion of securities. Margin receivables averaged $5.6 billion in the quarter, flat sequentially and up four percent year over year. Net operating interest income for the third quarter was $261 million, down from $279 million in the prior quarter and $306 million a year ago. Third quarter results reflected a net interest spread of 2.28 percent on average interest-earning assets of $44.9 billion, compared with a net interest spread of 2.44 percent on average interest-earning assets of $44.8 billion in the prior quarter. Commissions, fees and service charges, principal transactions, and other revenue in the third quarter were $153 million, compared with $154 million in the prior quarter and $181 million in the third quarter of 2011. Average commission per trade for the quarter was $11.24, compared to $10.68 in the prior quarter, and $10.76 in the third quarter of 2011. Total operating expenses for the quarter increased $8 million sequentially to $289 million. Compensation and benefits included the impact of $13 million in severance associated with the August departure of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer. Total assets ended the quarter at $50.4 billion, growing $1.2 billion from the prior quarter, as customer net selling and net inflows increased cash and deposits by $3.2 billion, which was partially offset by deleveraging actions of $1.3 billion. Deleveraging included approximately $0.8 billion in brokerage-related customer cash directed to third party institutions, as well as $0.5 billion in terminated wholesale funding obligations, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $51 million on early extinguishment of debt. The corresponding reduction to assets resulted in a gain on sale of securities, included in the $79 million of total net gains recorded during the quarter. The Company's loan portfolio ended the quarter at $11.1 billion, contracting $616 million from the prior quarter, primarily related to $458 million of paydowns. Provision for loan losses of $141 million included approximately $50 million related to loan charge-offs associated with newly identified bankruptcy filings. The Company utilizes third party servicers to obtain bankruptcy data specific to its loan portfolio. During the third quarter the Company identified an increase in bankruptcies reported to them by one specific servicer. In researching this increase the Company discovered that the servicer had not been reporting all prior bankruptcy data on a timely basis. As a result the Company implemented an enhanced procedure around all servicer reporting to corroborate bankruptcy reporting with independent third party data. Through this additional process, approximately $90 million of loans were identified in which the servicers failed to report the bankruptcy filing to the Company. Of those loans, approximately 90 percent are current. In accordance with the Company's long-standing policy to write down loans to their collateral value when notified of a borrower bankruptcy, these loans were written down during the third quarter, resulting in an increase to provision for loan losses of approximately $50 million. The Company also noted these additional charge-offs were not a result of the recently-issued regulatory guidance on the treatment of discharged bankruptcies. Excluding the effect of these additional charge-offs, provision for loan losses increased $24 million from the prior quarter to $91 million(2). This sequential increase was due primarily to a decline of $16 million in put-back settlements. Including the $50 million in charge-offs related to the aforementioned adjustments, net charge-offs in the quarter were $158 million, an increase of $38 million from the prior quarter. The allowance for loan losses at quarter-end was $508 million, down $17 million from the previous quarter. Despite the decline in the reserve balance, coverage ratios improved slightly across the portfolio. For the Company's entire loan portfolio, special mention delinquencies decreased six percent sequentially, and total at-risk delinquencies declined seven percent versus the second quarter. As compared to the year-ago period, both special mention delinquencies and total at-risk delinquencies declined 29 percent. As of September 30, 2012, the Company reported a consolidated Tier 1 common ratio of 10.9 percent(3), up from 10.2 percent in the prior period and 9.3 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2011. E*TRADE Bank ended the quarter with Tier 1 leverage(4) and total risk-based capital ratios of 7.9 percent and 19.3 percent, compared with 7.9 percent and 18.0 percent, respectively, at the end of the prior period and 8.1 percent and 17.2 percent, respectively, in the year-ago period. etrade</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1350604080293</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 19:48:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350605484382-90</Id><Title>Tomorrow: ETFC will further tank to $8.70s~8.80s</Title><Msg>Expecting it go under $8.50 next week.

Factoring the total cost associated with that debt, including the original issue discount and the unfavorable tax treatment, we estimate that a refinance at 6% would benefit earnings by approximately $0.20 per share annually. Consequently, our focus continues to be addressing this debt once it's callable in December. There is also an opportunity to further reduce our debt cost by refinancing the $243 million of 7 7/8% notes due in 2015. If we were to refinance this full issuance alongside the 12.5% notes at the same illustrative rate of 6%, we estimate the benefit to earnings would be an additional $0.01 of annual EPS. Beyond improving earnings, refinancing either or both of these notes in whole or in part would also reduce a use of corporate cash while lengthening our maturity profile. That said, one of our key objectives with any new debt issuance would be to create a structure that allows for prepayment within a reasonable period of time without costly penalties in anticipation of ultimately receiving bank capital distributions...."</Msg><Username>gar4one</Username><Timestamp>1350616821209</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 23:20:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350618265446-102</Id><Topic><Title>After reading minutes, I had this feeling that maybe I knew why the BOD wanted new leadersip</Title><Username>gar4one</Username><Timestamp>1350616445090</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 23:14:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We will have a minimum of -.60 tomorrow and my guess is that ETFC will be down under $8.60.</Msg><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1350618265446</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 23:44:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350618649756-103</Id><Title>Tomorrow: Huge Down-Day with -.10 per share loss!!!!</Title><Msg>Expecting ETFC to be traded under $8.70!!

In general, I am starting to believe that the normalized earnings power for this company is no more than 50 pennies annually. Put an 12x multiple on that and you get a fair pps of around $6 bucks.
