This is the same template Billy Clinton used, ignore all the problems so the folks would like him and saddle the next President with another 9/11. IRAN'S AHMADINEJAD ON HISTORIC VISIT TO CAIRO CAIRO (AP) -- President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrived in Egypt on Tuesday for the first visit by an Iranian leader in more than three decades, marking a historic departure from years of frigid ties between the two regional heavyweights. Egypt's Islamist President Mohammed Morsi gave Ahmadinejad a red-carpet welcome on the tarmac at Cairo airport, shaking the Iranian's hand and exchanging a kiss on each cheek as a military honor guard stood at attention. Ahmadinejad's three-day visit, which is centered around an Islamic summit, is the latest sign of improved relations between the countries since the 2011 uprising ousted Egypt's longtime ruler President Hosni Mubarak and brought an Islamist government to power in Cairo. Such a visit would have been unthinkable under Mubarak, who was a close ally of the U.S. and shared Washington's deep suspicions of Tehran.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360084837630</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 12:20:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360085071968-7</Id><Topic><Title>Post off topic political junk here if you are a MORON</Title><Username>mr_brightside_xy</Username><Timestamp>1360084250051</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 12:10:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>**We don't care about Obama, guns, immigration, NRA, Tea Parties** Who's we?

As seen NATIONWIDE yesterday on TV when Obimbo was in MPLS (Photo-Op) and spoke about the insane who got a legal permit to buy a gun and when he got fired he shot 2 co-workers and a UPS delivery man dead who was at the wrong place at the wrong time! The family of the shooter knew he had mental problems and that he was admitted to psychopathic care twice that year - nothing was revealed or entered into the data base to deny access to a permit to purchase a gun! And if so, nothing would happen because he wasn't a felon, so he couldn't be held accountable for lying on the form, because he was mentally ill! Then of course, he could have gone on Lawrey and Penn Ave. and buy a "special" for about $75+! I am for back ground checks, did mine for concealed carry - we need back ground checks with medical records but till they work nation wide - that will take 10 years!!!

Flash Mob Mayhem: Violent Groups Of Teens Leave NYC Businesses In Ruins NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Violent, thieving mobs have been making headlines across the country for the past few years, and now they have hit New York City. And Maurice Dubois reported in this CBS 2 investigation, the teen mobs have left neighborhoods worried as businesses take matters into their own hands. Judson Bennett, 78, recently ran into a violent group of teens – often described with the once-benign term “flash mob” – as he made his daily trip to buy a newspaper at his favorite news team. “I’m approaching the newsstand, and then suddenly there is a tremendous force behind me,” Bennett said. Bennett ended up with a broken arm. “I was taken completely by surprise,” he said. In New York and across the country, the mobs of kids – 20, 30, 40 or more — appear out of nowhere and suddenly charge a newsstand or convenience store. They ransack, steal and wreak havoc with no consideration for customers, such as Bennett, who get in their way. “They assemble, they do whatever it is that they’re going to do, and then they disassemble in a matter of minutes,”</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360096882000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:41:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360097201928-23</Id><Topic><Title>Flash Mobs code word for</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360096882000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 15:41:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Won't be long before somebody with a CCW considers their life in danger and starts laying some people out!

I reinvested in 2009 after he'd done the worst of the damage he was likely to do, but I did so slowly accelerating gradually. Not until recently (2011) have I began to invest more aggressively, and that only because nothing BUT aggressive investing will keep you above water when living on a fixed income. Like the guy in the article said, inflation is a real serious #$%$, and you really really have to try to keep it beat. Some in land, some in improving the land, some in metals (that you have, not bits of paper), some in weapons (and ammunition, or arrows, whatever), some in tools, mostly tools that you would need to make the tools needed to survive in a subsistence culture, and of course the rest in a mishmash of financial instruments, cash, and most importantly, holding NO high interest debt. That's the sort of thing I'm going for. Though I think I still have one item of high interest debt yet, as one of my godsons conned me into co-signing on his truck for him . . . . (not gonna do THAT again). And I got hosed in 2012, something like $5,500 in realized losses (Thanks Radio Shack!). Absent that bum trade I'd have made about 4k.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1360103653310</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 17:34:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360104713056-33</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$- IN DEPTH ETFC Analyst Report #$%$-</Title><Username>paulward735</Username><Timestamp>1360008343521</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 15:05:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great report.</Msg><Username>johnreed295</Username><Timestamp>1360104713056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 17:51:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360107425717-34</Id><Topic><Title>job creators?
