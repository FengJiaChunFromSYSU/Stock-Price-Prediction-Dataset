The measure was approved by a 28-10 vote and was expected to pass easily in the House of Representatives, which backed the 70-page bill in largely similar form earlier this week. Republicans have large majorities in both chambers. Republican Governor Sam Brownback, who opposes abortion, is expected to sign it. Opponents of the measure say it contains 40 provisions that affect a woman's health and intrude on her right to an abortion. Advocates said it mainly codifies existing practices, while helping women make more informed choices. "This fulfills the legislative intent to create a pro-life state," said Kathy Ostrowski, legislative director of Kansans for Life.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1365221076625</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 00:04:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365254126514-2</Id><Topic><Title>FDR and Crew spent Trillions getting rid of imaginary German problems</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1365188275136</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 14:57:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>talk about stupid! that is you, comparing #$%$ Germany which had conquered most of Europe to broken down Iraq torn by civil war and defeated, a threat to no country in 2003, even its neighbor saudi arabia was against W's moronic invasion of which the fmr commandant of the US marine corps and mid east expert Gen Zinni called a "brain fart", it had no connection to 911, and no wmd.

Since the arrival of the first inspectors in Iraq on 27 November 2002, UNMOVIC has conducted more than 550 inspections covering approximately 350 sites. Of these 44 sites were new sites. All inspections were performed without hinderance here is a good assessment: On Feb. 13, 2003, the chief UN inspector, Hans Blix, reported to the UN Security Council that there was no evidence of either active chemical or biological weapons programs or stockpiles. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei reported that there was no evidence of a reconstituted nuclear weapons program. On the basis of leads provided by U.S. and other intelligence agencies and information gained from earlier inspections, the UN inspectors conducted more than 760 inspections covering about 500 sites from November 2002 through February 2003.

For solar screens in my part of Texas, the trees are in the way, unless I want to clearcut my land or something (NOT!). A windmill on the property might work, it would only take one and I could sell power back to the power company. Unfortunately power is SO cheap in the country (particularly paying agricultural rates) that I don't know if that would even be a break even proposition. The only thing it WOULD do is eliminate total reliance on the power grid. The BEST idea I've had for getting energy is a natural gas turbine fed from a small capacity natural gas well on my property (which would double as a fuel source for the forge/kiln), but that would be a rather pricey method as far as initial cost. Don't need a snowblower, don't know if I WANT a boat (yet), and I rarely go anywhere since I'm mostly bedbound, add in my 40 odd acres of highly forested land and I'm not only WAY more "carbon neutral" than Vice-Paranoiac Gore but probably generate a huge net DECREASE in atmospheric carbon as for now none of the trees are harvested as fuel. So, Here I am the capitalist pig former military #$%$ from a southern state and I'm more "green" than most of the folks in Greenpeace.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1365267474468</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 12:57:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365267921111-6</Id><Title>About 90% of Afghans..............</Title><Msg>.............are already planing to leave the country and follow the coalition forces!

Our Congress with it's clueless leader better make some preperations and the training of their police/forces seems to be a lost cause as soon as we are withdrawing.

There are some truly outrageous stories this week, some laughable, some just downright disturbing. But statistically speaking, it hasn't been significantly different from any other week. We have the same approximately 50 incidents we always do. And by the way, if you ever find yourself overwhelmed by the volume, consider that CDC statistics on unintentional firearms injuries (which of course don't count near misses, forgotten guns, etc. the way we count them) for 2011 counted 14,675 incidents, which comes out to just over 282 such injuries each week. Which means the 35 or so accidental gunshot injuries I listed as having happened during the past week represent only about 12.5% of those we can statistically expect to have actually occurred. In other words, if these GunFAIL posts were truly comprehensive, we could expect there to be well over 300 entries weekly rather than just 50. Among the listings in this entry, three accidental shootings of girlfriends by macho men either showing off their guns, or drawing them during fights and missing their intended targets; one brand new entry in the growing collection of bathroom gun accidents; five accidents while cleaning loaded guns; three toddlers shot by found weapons; nine incidents involving the "highly trained" class of cops, ex-cops, security guards and National Guardsmen; and; three discharges through the walls of neighboring homes and buildings.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1365268544222</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 13:15:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365268655534-8</Id><Topic><Title>Gunfail 12</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1365268544222</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 13:15:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MESA, AZ, 3/13/13: A man prohibited from possessing a gun was arrested by Mesa police and accused of manslaughter after he accidentally shot and killed his 18-year-old girlfriend.

Kenny, a 49-year-old licensed National Rifle Association instructor who leads training classes in pistol and rifle use, delivered his arguments in the front foyer of the two-family Edgewood Avenue house where he rents an upstairs apartment in the Edgewood neighborhood. Wearing an NRA hooded sweatshirt, he had his left foot in a cast because he accidentally shot a bullet last week while cleaning his Glock handgun.

I grew up in Ohio and every year for vacation we'd trailer our speedboats (2 of them or 3, one ours and one my uncles, and later another that my younger uncle brought), and we'd rent a houseboat and spend two weeks tooling around Dale Hollow Lake bouncing between the dam, where we'd tie up to fish for trout, and the cove we'd park in while not there were we spent every OTHER night. We must have burned close to 20 gallons a day just in the speedboats. Moving the houseboat was pricey too, but it was slow despite two outboard engines, and fortunately the distance was short. What killed the fuel budget was waterskiing. A hybrid car would have been no use to us where we were, the closest town was 15 miles away (aside from our own, which had nothing worth driving to), and the salt laid down on the roads during the winter would have done HORRIBLE things to the "sealed" circuitry in a car with that number of batteries. So either they've put in corrosion PROOF materials all around any such parts such that if the batteries go they'd have to be factory replaced (probably just give you a whole new car to save money) and if its NOT totally sealed such that the thing is proof against road salt, then it''s gonna short out somewhere in the snow and ice within three years. I haven't seen one yet that can stand a lakeside winter.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1365290151314</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 19:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365295814874-15</Id><Topic><Title>A message for biddermon_ca</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1365096215615</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 13:23:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Try Texas on that list . . . you'll find it somewhere on the floor, with the other states that have no state income tax at all.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1365295814874</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 20:50:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365305134989-16</Id><Topic><Title>Tesla to Report Profit</Title><Username>biddermoron_ca</Username><Timestamp>1365280589874</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 16:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's right, as usual.
