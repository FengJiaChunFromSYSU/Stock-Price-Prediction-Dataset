Vincent Fox was a genius. He closed the southern boarder of Mexico to prevent immigration of poor people from South America, and at the same time promoted open boarder policies to the US. Thus relieving Mexico of millions of poor and ignorant low skilled workers by sending them north. And to add insult to injury for the US he asked these dopes to send money back to Mexico by the billions which they did, and are still doing(of course untaxed). He new that his country could not afford to have these folks around for two reasons, they couldn't afford them, and that they would eventually try and over throw the government for lack of "fairness" like most banana republics did further south. And who is stupid enough to take in the Trojan Horse...the Democrat party. Amnesty for 11 million illegals Hispanic amnesty activists are expanding their goals beyond the so-called “DREAM Act” youth amnesty, towards a national amnesty for roughly 11 million Hispanic illegals. President Barack Obama and Congress “need to come together to deliver change on immigration policy, and by that we mean … a roadmap to citizenship for our parents and communities,” said Cristina Jimenez, director of an advocacy group, United We Dream. Jimenez was born in Ecuador and arrived in this country as an illegal immigrant. “Deporting members of our community is irresponsible and unacceptable,” added Lorella Praeli, the group’s policy director. Their demand is an opening salvo in a post-election campaign to persuade the House GOP to provide “a path to citizenship” for roughly 11 million illegal immigrants, most of whom are low-skill laborers who compete for jobs against low-skill Americans. The amnesty goal is supported by many progressive groups, in part, because most Hispanics prefer generous welfare policies, and so usually vote for Democratic candidates. In contrast, many Republican advocates and legislators favor high-skill immigration, partly because high-skilled workers spur the economy and lower unemployment.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1352493990405</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 15:46:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352495031420-4</Id><Title>Petraeus</Title><Msg>Forced out for not playing ball on Benghazi?

Large loss on the refi, and I suspect another significant loss on wholesale pay down, as well as a generous provision for the bank. The uncertainty in the qrtly provisions is not good for the stock. If I was etrade I would put everything I could into the qrt and end 2012 with a bang. 2013 should begin better times for the company. EPS comps will be easy and look nice as provisions come down, and take over speculation will resurface as the balance sheet improves. But it will be an ugly qrt and tax loss selling is here. I'm selling short term calls and buying long term calls.The wildcard is the continued under performance of the loan book. Its been 5 years since the crap hit the fan, and there still writing down 1.5mill a day in bad paper. Putting the bank in runnoff has really hurt earnings but what choice do they have.
