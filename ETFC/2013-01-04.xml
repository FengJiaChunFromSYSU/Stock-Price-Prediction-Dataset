What Bibi held up there was when they get to the point where they can enrich uranium enough to put into a weapon, they don’t have a weapon to put it into." First sentence - we won't allow nuclear weapon. Next sentence - when they can put uranium into a weapon. So deep! Can anyone make sense of that? Would be perfect material for John Stewart. We have a demagogue as Commander in Chief and intellectual lightweight as his VP. What a winning combination! Security of the country is in great hands!</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1357282382495</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 01:53:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357309181605-2</Id><Topic><Title>Mccain and the piltdown princess, a former "mare" from alaska</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1357307666041</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 08:54:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wars were lost only because of liberals and those losses could be setting us up for a bigger war someday.

Letter From US Marine To Dianne Feinstein The following letter, written by U.S. Marine Joshua Boston and headlined “No ma’am.,” was posted in the CNN iReport on Dec. 27 with the included note from the producer and photo. It has struck a nerve with many and is being circulated around social media venues like Twitter and Facebook. Senator Dianne Feinstein, I will not register my weapons should this bill be passed, as I do not believe it is the government’s right to know what I own. Nor do I think it prudent to tell you what I own so that it may be taken from me by a group of people who enjoy armed protection yet decry me having the same a crime. You ma’am have overstepped a line that is not your domain. I am a Marine Corps Veteran of 8 years, and I will not have some woman who proclaims the evil of an inanimate object, yet carries one, tell me I may not have one. I am not your subject. I am the man who keeps you free. I am not your servant. I am the person whom you serve. I am not your peasant. I am the flesh and blood of America. I am the man who fought for my country. I am the man who learned. I am an American. You will not tell me that I must register my semi-automatic AR-15 because of the actions of some evil man. I will not be disarmed to suit the fear that has been established by the media and your misinformation campaign against the American public. We, the people, deserve better than you.

It was started by Democrat, preempted by Democrat, and Democrat House cut funds for the war in its late stage. Democrat "heroes" like John F Kerry protested, maligned and openly lied about the war. Lied to self promote, lied to get in power. Nixon didn't have much of a choice with regard to Vietnam. US didn't start Vietnam war to "prevent the vietamese from running their own country". Soviets did that, just as they did times and times again in Europe and Asia. South Vietnam asked for US help to confront imminent Communist occupation. John F Kerry and alike put a lot of effort to leave Vietnamese in massacre.

So they did have plenty to do with the war. While I am at this your hero JFK was so weak the Russians tried to put nukes in Cuba under him. Kruschev lied right to Kennedy's face and Kennedy let him. A week later Kruschev figured lets put nukes in Cuba and thanks to Kennedy's weakness we came close to war. Kennedy only did a blockade cause Goldwater, Reagan, Nixon would have eaten him for breakfast as would have a then more conservative America. Eisenhower also trained Cuban exiles to overthrow Cuba and JFK was so weak and spineless he would not provide one aircraft carrier of air support. No instead he made it the "Bay Of Pigs" Let them get slaughtered. JFK the biggest womanizing #$%$ ever in office. His whole klan is corrupt. His bro Ted killed his affair.
