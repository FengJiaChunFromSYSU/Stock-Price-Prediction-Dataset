There is no reason for them to have special, tax subsidized golf courses here or abroad either. and also perhaps the gop can look into some deficit cutting in the tax dollar appropriations for the so-called Army Morale, Welfare, and Recreation Fund MWR.... which is 60% funded by tax dollars. " Virginia’s Fort Belvoir Golf Club, for instance, charges as little as $37 for a round of golf with a cart, despite the fact that the course’s general manager admits that the local market dictates a fee of at least $60. With below-market revenue coming in, and outlays for maintenance equipment, personnel, and supplies coming at full market cost, it is difficult to imagine the courses turning much of a profit, if any, leaving USGA’s wishy-washy claim that the military’s golf courses receive “little to no federal funding,” in serious doubt." . Many of the courses sit on acres of valuable land that the government could sell or lease for a profit rather than maintain to charge below-market greens fees. Fort Belvoir’s two 18 hole courses and Andrews Air Force Base’s three 18 hole courses are both located in highly-populated Washington, D.C. suburbs, an area that’s home to some of the highest land values in the country. The military’s valuable golf course properties even extend overseas — the army has three courses in Germany worth a combined total of $36.4 million, and another in South Korea worth $26 million. Moreover, by being located on military bases, there are security costs to consider, as well as the cost of maintaining the electrical lines, water service, and roads, all of which former Arizona Senator Dennis DeConcini expressed concern about in the mid-1990s when Andrews spent $5.1 million to build its third course."</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1364304884028</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 09:34:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364308035388-4</Id><Title>Dumbo's Spring Breakers Spend Wildly!!</Title><Msg>Yep!

Much of this can be traced to Washington’s long, brutal, and destructive occupation, beginning with the installation of former CIA asset Ayad Allawi as interim prime minister. His hold on power quickly faltered, however, after he was used by the Americans to launch their second siege of Fallujah in November 2004, which resulted in the deaths of thousands more Iraqis, and set the stage for an ongoing health crisis in the city due to the types of weapons used by the U.S. military. In 2006, after Allawi lost political clout, then-U.S. ambassador to Iraq neoconservative Zalmay Khalilzad tapped Maliki as Washington’s new prime minister. It was then widely believed that he was the only politician whom both the U.S. and Iran could find acceptable. As one Iraqi official sarcastically put it, Maliki was the product of an agreement between “the Great Satan and the Axis of Evil.” In the years since, Maliki has become a de facto dictator. In Anbar Province and parts of Baghdad, he is now bitterly referred to as a “Shia Saddam.” Pictures of his less-than-photogenic face in front of an Iraqi flag hang above many of the countless checkpoints around the capital. When I see his visage looming over us yet again as we sit in traffic, I comment to my fixer, Ali, that his image is now everywhere, just as Saddam’s used to be. “Yes, they’ve simply changed the view for us,” Ali replies, and we laugh.

The U.S. forces that ousted Saddam Hussein’s regime immediately moved into his military bases and palaces. Now that the U.S. has left Iraq, those same bases and palaces are manned and controlled by the Maliki government. Saddam Hussein’s country was notoriously corrupt. Yet last year, Iraq ranked 169th out of 174 countries surveyed, according to Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index. It is effectively a failed state, with the Maliki regime incapable of controlling vast swaths of the country, including the Kurdish north, despite his willingness to use the same tactics once employed by Saddam Hussein and after him the Americans: widespread violence, secret prisons, threats, detentions, and torture"</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1364323813469</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:50:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364329850203-17</Id><Topic><Title>Feds Spend $2.7M to Study Drunk Lesbians</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363811176110</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 16:26:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It look as our vagabond with no place to call home has extended his cache of yahoo ID's.

There are many cases to be made against marriage discrimination — not least of which is the fact that it’s unconstitutional. On top of that, however, mounting scientific evidence also suggests that eliminating discriminatory practices against LGBT individuals will have significant health benefits for a community that has traditionally been vulnerable to health disparities. Here are three ways that promoting policies that ensure LGBT equality will improve our nation’s health: 1. The children of LGBT parents will grow up healthier. Just last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics formally endorsed marriage equality, citing the significant benefits in store for the children who grow up with same-sex parents. According to the group, those children will be able to take advantage of the “social and legal status social and legal status that civil marriage conveys to their parents.” Ultimately, it’s in the best interests of children for them to grow up in families that are acknowledged to be just as equal as any other family — rather than imparting harmful messages to kids that their parents somehow aren’t good enough. During this morning’s oral argument over California’s ban on same-sex marriage, Justice Anthony Kennedy spoke to this issue, noting that children of same-sex parents “want their parents to have full recognition and status” and the “voice of those children” is important.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1364341897456</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 19:51:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364342546977-25</Id><Topic><Title>Big Sis, why all the bullets?</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363895151699</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 15:45:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Big dummy, it's just another wingnut lie: "DHS responded to lawmakers’ questions about the purchase on Friday and Fox News contributor Charles Krauthammer dismissed the story as a conspiracy theory that night on Special Report. Watch the two side-by-side: In its letter to lawmakers, the agency explained that it regularly purchases ammunition in bulk to save money and noted that “the 1.6 billion number was misleading because the language of DHS’s purchase said it would need ‘up to’ a certain amount.” That letter came a month after DHS offered a detailed justification of its purchase to Coburn in February, who later claimed that he was satisfied with the reply. As Krauthammer explained to Fox News viewers on March 22, “Senator Coburn who isn’t exactly a liberal said number one the amount of ammunition is less than in previous years. Number two, it’s about a tenth of the ceiling that the DHS has allowed,” he said, adding, that the ammunition is “being used for the training of agents like the border security agents who have to go to the range a lot and stay sharp.” “I hate to disappoint the conspiracy theorists, they’re gonna have to come up with something new and they will,” he concluded.

Ten years later, nearly 5,000 American troops dead, thousands more with wounds, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead or wounded. When you think about this, was it worth it? PERLE: I’ve got to say I think that is not a reasonable question. What we did at the time was done in the belief that it was necessary to protect this nation. You can’t, a decade later, go back and say, “Well we shouldn’t have done that.”</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1364345640704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 20:54:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364345739427-28</Id><Topic><Title>Dare not ask if Iraq worth it!!</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1364345640704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 20:54:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perle has tried hard over the years to either justify the war or even wipe his fingerprints from it altogether. He once even tried to say he, and the neoconservatives in the Bush administration, had “no influence” on the decision and just yesterday, he said it didn’t matter whether Saddam Hussein had WMD, the U.S. should have invaded anyway (he actually had previously said the U.S. wouldn’t have invaded if the U.S. knew he had no WMD). But as far as whether the war was worth it, Matt Duss has a pretty good take: “The end of former Iraq President Saddam Hussein’s brutal regime represents a consider- able global good, and a nascent democratic Iraqi republic partnered with the United States could potentially yield benefits in the future,” he writes in the Iraq War Ledger, A Look at the War’s Human, Financial, and Strategic Costs, “But when weighing those possible benefits against the costs of the Iraq intervention, there is simply no conceivable calculus by which Operation Iraqi Freedom can be judged to have been a successful or worthwhile policy. The war was intended to show the extent of America’s power. It succeeded only in showing its limits.”</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1364345739427</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 20:55:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364353440787-29</Id><Title>Uptrend will resume this week</Title><Msg>Well in to earnings.

Steve Beshear's veto of controversial legislation referred to as the "religious freedom" bill. The state Senate is expected to override the veto later tonight. The bill will allow someone with "sincerely held" religious beliefs to disregard state laws and regulations.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1364355810816</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 23:43:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
