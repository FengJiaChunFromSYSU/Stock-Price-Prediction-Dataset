Each page of concept is multiple pages of statutory law with mentions throughout much of the rest of the body of the legislation, and like computer programs, if the design isn't functional then handling all the exceptional cases is going to get 90% of the work while 90% of the cases can be handled by 10%. I imagine the Democrats might have done that first 10%, and then considering themselves well served, went on to punt with the 90% of the legislation to catch the other 10% of the situations.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1370502614128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 03:10:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370521995072-3</Id><Title>DARTS up 15% in April !</Title><Msg>very good numbers...+11% compared to May 2012</Msg><Username>headtoo</Username><Timestamp>1370521995072</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 08:33:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370531069887-4</Id><Title>Scott Walker/Koch bros.

"Wisconsin clearly is not leading the recovery," said William Delwiche, an economist in Milwaukee at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. The Philadelphia Fed data is from its monthly state-by-state index of leading economic growth indicators, and is meant to predict how the state's economy will grow in the next six months. The 50-state Leading Index report for April showed only five states with contraction, assigning Wisconsin an index rank of -0.74%. Wyoming, with a rank of -1.29%, is the only state with a lower index.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1370531069887</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 11:04:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370533771539-5</Id><Title>Why would he spend so much?</Title><Msg>Sheldon Adelson's Woes Mount With Grand Jury In Las Vegas Sands Money-Laundering Probe Posted: 06/05/2013 10:22 am EDT The legal headaches besetting billionaire Sheldon Adelson’s Las Vegas Sands Corp. now include a grand jury in Los Angeles, part of a federal money-laundering probe of his Nevada-based casinos, The Huffington Post has learned. The involvement of a federal grand jury, not previously reported, suggests an escalation of the money-laundering investigation into Sands and one of its executives, being led by the U.S. attorney for Los Angeles, according to a person with direct knowledge of the inquiry.

Report: Gov't scooping up Verizon phone records WASHINGTON (AP) - The National Security Agency has been collecting the telephone records of millions of U.S. customers of Verizon under a top secret court order, according to a report in Britain's Guardian newspaper. The order was granted by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court on April 25 and is good until July 19, the newspaper reported Wednesday. The order requires Verizon, one of the nation's largest telecommunications companies, on an "ongoing, daily basis" to give the NSA information on all telephone calls in its systems, both within the U.S. and between the U.S. and other countries. The newspaper said the document, a copy of which it had obtained, shows for the first time that under the Obama administration the communication records of millions of U.S. citizens were being collected indiscriminately and in bulk, regardless of whether they were suspected of any wrongdoing.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1370546509395</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 15:21:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370548337449-13</Id><Topic><Title>Turn off your Verizon phone if you are having an affair</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1370546509395</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 15:21:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What if I've been playing hide the salami with Michelle?

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) proposed an amendment to the DHS spending bill for 2014 that would require the report to Congress before it can pursue plans to buy 1.1 billion rounds of ammunition. Meadows said the speed bump is a necessary reaction to news of the huge purchase, which alarmed many Americans and prompted conservative groups to suspect that the government was stocking up on the rounds.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1370558451504</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:40:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370562848676-22</Id><Topic><Title>Trainwreck!</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1370475735404</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 19:42:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>America should follow the Texas model of health care...
