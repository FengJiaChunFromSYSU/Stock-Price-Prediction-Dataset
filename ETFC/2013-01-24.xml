Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) will introduce a bill banning assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips on Thursday.

Her new measure will ban the sale of about 150 types of firearms, including some rifles and handguns, as well as the sale of high-capacity magazines, according to USA Today.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1359059391484</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:29:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359060521649-14</Id><Title>Obama's economy</Title><Msg>The entitlement society at it best...give me my MF'en Obama free food or I will pummel your face. Brawl Erupts At East St. Louis Food Stamp Office A dispute over a spot in line at a food stamp office downstate escalated into a full-fledged brawl. The fight on Tuesday was captured on video and shows at least four women wrestling and punching each other. At one point, the video shows two women grabbing each other while a third punches one of them on the back of the head. At another point, a woman walks across the office and punches another person in the face. Security officers struggled to end the chaos. It took them several minutes to separate the group and restore order. Some of the people involved in the fight initially refused to leave. The incident happened at the Illinois Department of Human Services office in East St. Louis, reportedly only a few blocks from the police station there.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1359060521649</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 15:48:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359061617499-15</Id><Title>(.65)...</Title><Msg>Same old ...Same old...</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1359061617499</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 16:06:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359061696876-16</Id><Topic><Title>(.65)...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1359061617499</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 16:06:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dog turds every single quarter.

She is a hypocrite. When it happen to her in he past that she needs to protect her own life, she decided to own a weapon. Now, when her life is protected by guards she can afford to hire, she feels like she can dictate to others what kind of weapons if any they should be allowed to pocess. But Feinstein represents CA where lots of idiots with right to vote live. She has her seat safe no matter what she does. Lets see if she has that much support among the members of her own party. Regardless. She apeared to be moderate in the past, but that's just a mask.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1359068196371</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:56:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359069604368-40</Id><Topic><Title>Income From Ops - Doubled</Title><Username>cohsgrad</Username><Timestamp>1359065338732</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:08:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Granted they missed. That said, look at the big picture. New CEO. Obviously clearing the decks with asset writedowns (that should have occurred long ago). Basically a kitchen sink quarter for the new CEO. Look at the major holders: Citadel, Omega, TPG Axon... not guys you take lightly. They eat their young for a dime. TPG Axon, led by an ex Goldman principal genius, has almost 4% of it's fund in ETFC. Don't think he's looking to sink his fund. Tomorrow may well be rocky, but look at the facts, the past garbage is being recognized and written off, the continuing business is improving, and a new CEO has come in no doubt with great incentives. Two years from now, this thing will be gold.</Msg><Username>sir_stock_sage</Username><Timestamp>1359069604368</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 18:20:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359070707456-41</Id><Topic><Title>Income From Ops - Doubled</Title><Username>cohsgrad</Username><Timestamp>1359065338732</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:08:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This company isn't terribly hard to understand but it is important to look at closely because if you don't it is easy to develop a misunderstanding of the situation. 1) Have a core on-line brokerage business that is very profitable and worth substantially more than what its carrying value. Long future stream of income. 2) Have the home loans that are worth significantly less than what they are carried at. There is still risk here and losses to be booked. 3) The parent company, the owner of each of these two separate businesses faced a liquidity crisis during the bubble and had to borrow money at an extremely high interest rate and carried pre-payment penalties. They indicated the effective interest rate was 17% in the call. In effect, #2 and #3 were large losses incurred during the housing bubble explosion that weren't booked under the accounting rules and have been dribbling out for years. Number 3 is now completely booked and it was huge; there is nothing left to come. They are going to begin reporting substantial profits beginning next quarter. That is a fact and headlines talking about "wider than expected losses" are just a way of grabbing reader's attention. Kind of the equivalent of saying "E-Trade expected to become wildly profitable in future" as I was hoping for.</Msg><Username>cohsgrad</Username><Timestamp>1359070707456</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 18:38:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359070929379-42</Id><Topic><Title>Income From Ops - Doubled</Title><Username>cohsgrad</Username><Timestamp>1359065338732</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:08:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>On the loans I should have said that they were prohibited from pre-paying prior to the time they paid it off.

The Royal Society, Britain's premier scientific institution -- whose previous president declared that "the debate on climate change is over" -- "is being forced to review its statements on climate change after a rebellion by members who question mankind's contribution to rising temperatures. ... The society has been accused by 43 of its Fellows of refusing to accept dissenting views on climate change and exaggerating the degree of certainty that man-made emissions are the main cause." Most of the rebels were retired, as one of them explained, "One of the reasons people like myself are willing to put our heads above the parapet is that our careers are not at risk from being labeled a denier or flat-Earther because we say the science is not settled. The bullying of people into silence has unfortunately been effective." In America, Dr. Ivar Giaever, a Nobel Prize-winner in physics, resigned in protest from the American Physical Society this fall because of the Society's policy statement: "The evidence is incontrovertible: global warming is occurring." Dr. Giaver: Incontrovertible is not a scientific word. Nothing is incontrovertible in science. In the APS it is ok to discuss whether the mass of the proton changes over time and how a multi-universe behaves, but the evidence of global warming is incontrovertible? The claim (how can you measure the average temperature of the whole earth for a whole year?) is that the temperature has changed from ~288.0 to ~288.8 degree Kelvin in about 150 years, which (if true) means to me is that the temperature has been amazingly stable, and both human health and happiness have definitely improved in this "warming" period. In 2008, Prof. Giaever endorsed Barack Obama's candidacy, but he has since joined 100 scientists who wrote an open letter to Obama, declaring: "We maintain that the case for alarm regarding climate change is grossly overstated."</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1359078104385</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 20:41:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359078175408-47</Id><Title>Any Reason To Hold This Stock</Title><Msg>Bought E-trade pre-split and held for several years is it worth holding for another year or two will it ever bounce back</Msg><Username>option291</Username><Timestamp>1359078175408</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 20:42:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359079298080-48</Id><Title>5 CEOs in 4 years!!!</Title><Msg>Bad bad bad sign</Msg><Username>muyjk1</Username><Timestamp>1359079298080</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 21:01:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359080592207-49</Id><Topic><Title>E*Trade earnings, or lack of... and you wonder why</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1359066833333</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 17:33:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>disaster /////now they want to give advice to others. is there anything good in the report??</Msg><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1359080592207</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 21:23:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359080778968-50</Id><Topic><Title>Any Reason To Hold This Stock</Title><Username>option291</Username><Timestamp>1359078175408</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 20:42:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They issued too much stock after the bubble burst to ever hope to get back to the pre-split levels.
