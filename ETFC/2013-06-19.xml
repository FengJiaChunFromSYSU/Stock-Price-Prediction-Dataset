The long-awaited report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office marked a major victory for the bipartisan “Gang of Eight” senators who have spent months negotiating the details of the measure. Although some conservatives say the bill would cost the nation billions of dollars, CBO analysts concluded the opposite, undercutting a potentially powerful argument against the legislation. “This report is a huge momentum boost for immigration reform,” said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), the lead Democratic negotiator. “This debunks the idea that immigration reform is anything other than a boon to our economy and robs the bill’s opponents of one of their last remaining arguments.” The White House welcomed the report, saying in a statement, “Today, we have more proof that bipartisan commonsense immigration reform will be good for economic growth and deficit reduction: this time, in the form of a nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimate.”</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1371622515455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 02:15:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371645523274-3</Id><Title>SELL on the news!!</Title><Msg>How in the world ETFC stay at 4 millions accounts which same as 10 years ago???

" the CBO routinely succeeds in frustrating Republicans and Democrats alike. The agency also has a strong track record. A study in the journal Polity examined the accuracy of economic forecasts made by the White House, the Federal Reserve, and the CBO between 1979 and 1997. During that time, the administration's forecasts were the least accurate and the CBO's were the most accurate. (The Fed forecasted inflation as accurately as the CBO but wasn't as good on gross-national-product growth and unemployment.) The study also found partisan bias in the White House forecasts: Republican administrations tend to exaggerate inflation while Democratic ones exaggerate unemployment. Neither of these tendencies shows up in the CBO's projections."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1371653422772</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 10:50:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371653583373-18</Id><Title>I've Always Thought These Political Posters</Title><Msg>are in cahoots somehow.

The newspaper, citing spending records it obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, also said the McDonnells used state employees to run personal errands for their adult children and billed the state for deodorant, shoe repairs and a digestive system "detox cleanse." The Washington Post has previously reported that McDonnell, who has been mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2016, was under investigation by the FBI and a grand jury over a $15,000 catering bill from his daughter's wedding in 2011 that was paid for by a campaign donor. A McDonnell spokesman, Tucker Martin, told the newspaper that the couple had sought to distinguish personal expenses from state ones while living in the governor's mansion. McDonnell was elected governor in 2009 and state law bars him from reelection. "The McDonnell Administration has adhered to precedent in reimbursing the state for items meant for personal use," Martin told the Post in an email. Administration officials could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Monday for comment on the report. The governor has acknowledged that he stayed at the Roanoke, Virginia, home of the campaign donor, Jonnie Williams, and drove Williams' Ferrari sports car back to Richmond. Williams is the chief executive of Star Scientific Inc , a nutritional supplements maker in the Richmond area. According to the Washington Post, the FBI is looking into whether the governor's office helped advance the business interests of Williams in exchange for the gifts.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1371655723500</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 11:28:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371660397415-22</Id><Topic><Title>If the GOP racists really cared about deficits.....</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1371622515455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 02:15:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow!

I DO trust the CBO, WHEN I know where they come up with their numbers. What I DON'T trust is off the cuff numbers without a spreadsheet to back them up. Besides, here in Texas we mostly ignore the border south of El Paso Del Norte. I have NO idea why people wanted to cross in Arizona save that it's closer to California with its no questions asked public assistance whereas Texas DOES tend to ask questions. The immigrant population here doesn't bother us half so much as almost all of them are working class and usually don't cross unless they already have employment. I suspect that poverty in Northern Mexico along with associated drug violence is possibly more severe than in the rest of the country, contributing to the higher number of northern border crossings. And here we thought NAFTA would result in increased wages in Mexico when in fact its resulted in lower wages in the United States.

Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) has released the full transcript of a key interview with an IRS employee at the heart of the agency's scandal. The 200-page transcript sheds additional light on the decision by the IRS to screen out tea party groups applying for tax-exempt status during the months and years leading up to the 2012 elections. Republican and Democratic committee staffers interviewed IRS official John Shafer on June 6 about the agency's decision to scrutinize a tea party group's application for tax-exempt 501(c)(4) status.

Opponents of immigration reform had assumed that new citizens becoming eligible for Obamacare and other benefits would add to the deficit during the second ten-year period, so much so that Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) specifically asked the CBO to analyze that period. Much to their surprise, the CBO findings underscore that the tremendous economic benefits of reform, including millions of new taxpayers, significantly outweigh any additional costs."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1371671069786</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 15:44:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371671173378-41</Id><Topic><Title>If the GOP racists really cared about deficits.....</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1371622515455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 02:15:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>racism smacism - who cares? your posts are foolish</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1371671173378</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 15:46:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371671297227-42</Id><Topic><Title>If the GOP racists really cared about deficits.....</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1371622515455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 02:15:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Just to put these deficit reduction numbers in context, here’s the impact of some of the deficit reduction policies Republicans favor: Raising the Medicare age to 67 would save $125 BILLION over the next decade — $72 BILLION less than immigration reform. Switching to a different measure of inflation (so-called chained-CPI) that will reduce Social Security and other benefits would save $130 BILLION over the next decade – $67 BILLION less than immigration reform. Cutting off SNAP (food stamps) benefits for nearly 2 MILLION people, as the Farm Bill that House Republicans are currently debating does, would save $21 BILLION over the next decade – $176 BILLION less than immigration reform. Denying the child tax credit to the immigrant parents of American citizen children, as Republicans have repeatedly proposed, would save $24 BILLION over the next decade — $172 BILLION less than immigration reform. Fortunately, we don’t have do any of these things and we can still enjoy dramatic deficit reduction, boost our economy, and make millions of peoples’ lives better."
