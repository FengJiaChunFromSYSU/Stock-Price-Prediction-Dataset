One day after The White House released 100 pages of Benghazi emails, a report has surfaced alleging that Republicans released a set with altered text. CBS News reported Thursday that leaked versions sent out by the GOP last Friday had visible differences than Wednesday's official batch. Two correspondences that were singled out in the report came from National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and State Department Spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. The GOP version of Rhodes' comment, according to CBS News: "We must make sure that the talking points reflect all agency equities, including those of the State Department, and we don't want to undermine the FBI investigation." The White House email: "We need to resolve this in a way that respects all of the relevant equities, particularly the investigation." The GOP version of Nuland's comment, according to CBS News: The penultimate point is a paragraph talking about all the previous warnings provided by the Agency (CIA) about al-Qaeda's presence and activities of al-Qaeda." The White House email: "The penultimate point could be abused by members to beat the State Department for not paying attention to Agency warnings."</Msg><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1368804786318</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 11:33:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368805359587-17</Id><Topic><Title>GOP Altered Benghazi Emails</Title><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1368804786318</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 11:33:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1- 4 dead Americans. 2- Who pushed the 'Video'? 3- Where was Hillary-Dumbo and what were they doing the entire day of 9/11/2013. 4- Why won't Hillary-Dumbo get back to the 4 dead American's families like they promised?
