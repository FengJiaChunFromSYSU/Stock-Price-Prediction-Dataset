Republicans are a mess right now; coming face to face with the cuts they’ve championed in rhetoric for years is causing an utter collapse. Republican staffers are complaining that GOP leadership is giving them no clues about how they can prepare for the upcoming cuts, while leadership is complaining that without being able to pay their staff (public sector workers) a decent wage, including a raise, they can’t attract the best workers. The Hill reported Monday: One veteran chief of staff lamented that his office hasn’t given raises to its employees for several years — worrying that without a reward for their hard work, it will be difficult to attract bright individuals to Capitol Hill. “What’s the incentive for smart talented people to come work for Congress?” the source said. Head banging on desk. Yes, Republicans… Come to the water. Come slowly to the water. Now drink. Guess what, Republicans? Most Americans aren’t getting raises right now, and it’s not because they suck at their jobs. Also, thanks for making the exact same argument that public sector unions have been making regarding cuts to teachers’ pay, etc. snip// Can you still eat? I’m not sure we’re on the same playing field yet. See, these cuts are going to take food from babies and seniors. Forgive me if I find that a little more troubling than Republican retention. snip// Meanwhile, lost Republican staffers wander aimlessly looking for a few pencils they can cross off the budget as panic sets in. This is but the beginning of the sequester squeals, and it’s coming from within the Republican Party. Getting what they wanted isn’t working out quite as they imagined.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1361911186819</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 15:39:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361916731228-8</Id><Topic><Title>gop doesn't have half a brain among them</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1361903028522</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 13:23:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2008 - $2,982 2009 - $3,517 2010 - $3,456 2011 - $3,603 2012 - $3,795 Since 2008 it is 27% increase! 2009 huge 18% increase wasn't Bush's fault, he submitted only $3.1T. So, you are cooking books, dear. And of course, you conveniently ignore the fact that deficit jumped almost 3x since 2008. Keep telling us we don't have spending problem. Anyone with half a brain knows it is a lie. Lots of people would just ignore the reality even recognizing the fact that this can't last long. Those have only half a brain. But for you though, accumulating over $1T of debt every year is not a problem. That means your love for Obama ate the other thinking half.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1361916731228</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-26 17:12:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361918472230-9</Id><Title>The GOPiggies Great Recession</Title><Msg>It was job losses that created the deficits, pretty obvious who to blame: United States Percent of US civilian working age population employed, 1995–2012 September 2008 – 432,000 jobs lost October 2008 – 489,000 jobs lost November 2008 – 803,000 jobs lost December 2008 – 661,000 jobs lost[2] January 2009 – 818,000 jobs lost February 2009 – 724,000 jobs lost March 2009 – 799,000 jobs lost April 2009 – 692,000 jobs lost May 2009 – 361,000 jobs lost June 2009 – 482,000 jobs lost July 2009 – 339,000 jobs lost August 2009 – 231,000 jobs lost September 2009 – 199,000 jobs lost October 2009 – 202,000 jobs lost[3] November 2009 - 64,000 jobs created[4] December 2009 - 109,000 jobs lost[4] January 2010 - 40,000 jobs lost[4] February 2010 - 35,000 jobs lost March 2010 - 189,000 jobs created April 2010 - 239,000 jobs created May 2010 - 516,000 jobs created June 2010 - 167,000 jobs lost July 2010 - 58,000 jobs lost (143,000 Federal Census jobs lost) [5] August 2010 - 51,000 jobs lost September 2010 - 27,000 jobs lost (According to U.S. Labor Department, 64,000 private sector jobs are added but a net loss of 95,000 jobs are due to government layoffs) [6][7] October 2010 - 220,000 jobs created (Private sector jobs net increase) November 2010 - 121,000 jobs created December 2010 - 120,000 jobs created January 2011 - 110,000 jobs created February 2011 - 220,000 jobs created March 2011 - 246,000 jobs created April 2011 - 251,000 jobs created May 2011 - 54,000 jobs created June 2011 - 84,000 jobs created July 2011 - 96,000 jobs created August 2011 - 85,000 jobs created September 2011 - 202,000 jobs created October 2011 - 112,000 jobs created November 2011 - 157,000 jobs created December 2011 - 223,000 jobs created January 2012 - 275,000 jobs created February 2012 - 259,000 jobs created March 2012 - 143,000 jobs created April 2012 - 68,000 jobs created May 2012 - 87,000 jobs created June 2012 - 45,000 jobs created July 2012 - 181,000 jobs created August 2012 - 142,000 jobs created September 2012 - 114,000 jobs created 2008 (September 2008 – December 2008) – 2.6 million jobs lost 2009 (January 2009 – December 2009) – 4.2 million jobs lost[8] 2010 (January 2010-December 2010) - 863,000 jobs created Note: Job losses in June and July 2010 are largely attributed to US census worker jobs lost.

It is administration currently in power which was spending money. See, Bush was a spender, yes, but for Obama Bush's budget was too small. So Obama managed to overspend Bush's overblown budget by $400B. We went through that so many times. But again, with your ADD it is vitually impossible to focus on the root of the problem, which is deficit. Obama beat all records here. And the deficit is what will eventually bring US to its knees all while you talking about Bush when the guy is not in power for more than 4 years. Sequestration will cut so little out of US budget, that no one would even notice the difference. With sequestration In 2013 we will still spend more than 2012.
