It is I again, Mitt Romney, your better. I am currently preparing for tomorrow night's debate. As I understand it, the premise of this debate is that the commoners themselves will ask questions of me. This seems highly irregular (typically, the proper response to commoners asking questions is to summon security), but seems to be an expected part of the process. No matter; I still have a great many zinged statements that I did not get to use during the previous debate, most of which can be repurposed towards commoners if need be. I have found commoners to be no brighter than press units, in general: As experiment, I have been alternately promising to cut all taxes and promising that taxes will not be cut, depending on who is asking, and as far as I can discern there is not one person in the nation who has noticed the contradiction. Speaking of commoners, Mini-Mitt told me that he had recently volunteered at a kitchen for soups. He said it was very arduous work, and that even the clean dishes there were very dirty, forcing him to wash them again because, he said, commoners are well known for not being very good at washing things. This is curious, as I have generally found cleaning things (dishes, cars, houses and the like) to be one of the few things commoners are successful at. (Commoners excel at yard work—I cannot stress enough how very much they seem to enjoy such tasks.) Perhaps there is opportunity here to bring up my tax plan again? If we reduce taxes on wealthy Americans, wealthy Americans will be able to acquire more things; they will then be obliged to hire commoners to come clean those additional things, which will create more commoner jobs in the field of cleaning things. Yes, I will definitely have to remember that for tomorrow night. I do not have much else to report, Mr. Diary. I have been feeling better about the campaign of late, primarily because I have had to do very little actual campaigning. Most of my time is spent now in fundraisers, which are far more enjoyable than giving speeches to commoners. The enjoyable part about fundraisers is that individuals are assigned seats strictly in accordance with their wealth, with more financially successful individuals nearer the front and lesser wealth units towards the back, in table-by-table gradations. This immediately makes clear who ought to be paid attention to, and in what proportions. It is simple, straightforward and effective. If only the rest of this silly process could be as efficient!</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1350360480931</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 00:08:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350362984847-2</Id><Title>Bush was warned about attacks on 9/11 and did nothing.</Title><Msg>And 3000 people perished!!!</Msg><Username>dems_win</Username><Timestamp>1350362984847</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 00:49:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350374146345-3</Id><Topic><Title>ATTN GOP SENATORS: Walmart Is The Largest Food Stamp Recipient In The Country—Fine Them!</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1350356759270</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:05:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can't force common sense to people who are deaf and dumb..</Msg><Username>greekislandtaverna</Username><Timestamp>1350374146345</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 03:55:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350374342023-4</Id><Topic><Title>Bush was warned about attacks on 9/11 and did nothing.</Title><Username>dems_win</Username><Timestamp>1350362984847</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 00:49:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes he did...

A former Republican tells it like it is: voter ID laws unfairly burden minorities. By Jeremiah Goulka | Mon Oct. 15, 2012 11:41 AM PDT Democrats are frustrated: Why can't Republican voters see that Republicans pass voter ID laws to suppress voting, not fraud? Democrats know who tends to lack ID. They know that the threat of in-person voter fraud is wildly exaggerated [3]. Besides, Republican officials could hardly have been clearer about the real purpose behind these laws and courts keep striking them down as unconstitutional. Still, Republican support remains sky high [4], with only one third [5] of Republicans recognizing that they are primarily intended to boost the GOP's prospects. How can Republican voters go on believing that the latest wave of voter ID laws is about fraud and that it's the opposition [6] to the laws that's being partisan? To help frustrated non-Republicans, I offer up my own experience as a case study. I was [7] a Republican for most of my life, and during those years I had no doubt that such laws were indeed truly about fraud. Please join me on a tour of my old outlook on voter ID laws and what caused it to change. Fraud on the Brain I grew up in a wealthy Republican suburb of Chicago, where we worried about election fraud all the time. Showing our IDs at the polls seemed like a minor act of political rebellion against the legendary Democratic political machine that ran the city and county. "Vote early and often!" was the catchphrase we used for how that machine worked. Those were its instructions to its minions, we semi-jokingly believed, and it called up an image of mass in-person voter fraud. We hated the "Democrat" machine, seeing it as inherently corrupt, and its power, we had no doubt, derived from fraud. When it wasn't bribing voters or destroying ballots, it was manipulating election laws—creating, for instance, a signature-collecting requirement so onerous that only a massive organization like itself could easily gather enough John Hancocks to put its candidates on the ballot. Republicans with long memories still wonder if Richard Nixon lost Illinois—and the 1960 election—thanks to Chicago Mayor Richard Daley's ability to make dead Republicans vote for John F. Kennedy. For us, any new report of voter fraud, wrapped in rumor and historical memory, just hammered home what we already knew: it was rampant in our county thanks to the machine. And it wasn't just Chicago. We assumed that all cities were run by similarly corrupt Democratic organizations. As for stories of rural corruption and vote tampering? You can guess which party we blamed. Corruption, election fraud, and Democrats: they went hand-in-hand-in-hand. Sure, we were aware of the occasional accusation of corruption against one or another Republican official. Normally, we assumed that such accusations were politically motivated. If they turned out to be true, then you were obviously talking about a "bad apple." I must admit that I did occasionally wonder whether there were any Republican machines out there, and the more I heard about the dominating one in neighboring DuPage County, the less I wanted to know. (Ditto Florida in 2000.) Still, I knew—I knew—that the Dems would use any crooked tool in the box to steal elections. Therefore America needed cleaner elections, and cleaner elections meant voter ID laws. Doesn't Everyone Have an ID? Every once in a while I'd hear the complaint—usually from a Democrat—that such laws were "racist." Racist? How could they be when they were so commonsensical? The complainers, I figured, were talking nonsense, just another instance of the tiresome PC brigade slapping the race card on the table for partisan advantage. If only they would scrap their tedious, tendentious identity and victim politics and come join the rest of us in the business of America. All this held until one night in 2006. At the time, my roommate worked at a local bank branch, and that evening when we got into a conversation, he mentioned to me that the bank required two forms of identification to open an account. Of course, who wouldn't? But then he told me this crazy thing: customers would show up with only one ID or none at all—and it wasn't like they had left them at home. "Really?" I said, blown away by the thought of it. "Yeah, really." And here was the kicker: every single one of them was black and poor. As I've written elsewhere [7], this was one of the moments that opened my eyes to a broader reality which, in the end, caused me to quit the Republican Party. I had no idea. I had naturally assumed—to the extent that I even gave it a thought—that every adult had to have at least one ID. Like most everyone in my world, I've had two or three at any given time since the day I turned 16 and begged my parents to take me to the DMV. Until then, I couldn't imagine how voter ID laws might be about anything but fraud. That no longer held up for the simple reason that, in the minds of Republican operators and voters alike, there is a pretty simple equation: Black + Poor = Democrat. And if that was the case, and the poor and black were more likely to lack IDs, then how could those laws not be aimed at them? Whenever I tell people this story, most Republicans and some Democrats are shocked. Like me, they had no idea that there are significant numbers of adults out there who don't have IDs. [8]Of course, had I bothered to look, the information about this was hiding in plain sight. According to [9] the respected Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law, 7% of the general voting public doesn't have an adequate photo ID, but those figures rise precipitously when you hit certain groups: 15% of voting age citizens making less than $35,000 a year, 18% of Americans over 65, and a full quarter of African Americans. A recent study [10] by other researchers focusing on the swing-state of Pennsylvania found that one in seven voters there lack an ID—one in three in Philadelphia—with minorities far more likely than whites to fall into this category. In fact, every study around notes this disparate demographic trend, even the low-number outlier study preferred by [11] Hans van Spakovsky, the conservative Heritage Foundation's voter "integrity [12]" activist: its authors still found [13] that "registered voters without photo IDs tended to be female, African-American, and Democrat." The "R" Bomb The more I thought about it, the more I understood why Democrats claim that these laws are racist. By definition, a law that intentionally imposes more burdens on minorities than on whites is racist, even if that imposition is indirect. Seeing these laws as distant relatives of literacy tests and poll taxes no longer seemed so outrageous to me. After I became a Democrat, I tried explaining this to some of the Republicans in my life, but I quickly saw that I had crossed an invisible tripwire. You see, if you ever want to get a Republican to stop listening to you, just say the "R" word: racism. In my Republican days, any time a Democrat started talking about how some Republican policy or act was racist, I rolled my eyes and thought Reagan-esquely, there they go again… We loathed identity politics, which we viewed as invidious—as well as harmful to minorities. And the "race card" was so simplistic, so partisan, so boring. Besides, what about all that reverse discrimination? Now that was racist. We also hated any accusation that made it sound like we were personally racist. It's a big insult to call someone a racist or a bigot, and we loathed it when Democrats associated the rest of us Republicans with the bigots in the party. At least in my world, we rejected racism, which we defined (in what I now see as a conveniently narrow way) as intentional and mean-spirited acts or attitudes—like the laws passed by segregationist Democrats. This will undoubtedly amaze non-Republicans, but given all of the above, Republican voters continue to hear the many remarkably blunt statements by those leading the Republican drive to pass voter ID laws not as racist but at the very worst Democratist. That includes comments like that of Pennsylvania House majority leader Mike Turzai [14] who spoke of "voter ID, which is going to allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania: done." Or state Representative Alan Clemmons, the principal sponsor of South Carolina's voter ID law, who handed out bags of peanuts with this note [15] attached: "Stop Obama's nutty agenda and support voter ID." Besides, some would point out that these laws also affect other people like the elderly (who often vote Republican) or out-of-state college students (often white)—and the latter would make sense as a target, because in the words [16] of New Hampshire House leader Bill O'Brien, that's the age when you tend to "foolishly... do what kids do": "vote as a liberal." And yes, this might technically violate the general principle that clean elections should include everyone, but partisans won't mind the results. This makes me wonder how bothered I would have been had I known how committed Republican strategists are to winning elections by shrinking [17] the electorate rather than appealing to more of it. I did certainly harbor a quiet suspicion that, to the extent we were the party of the managerial class, we were inherently fated to be a minority party. The Safety Valve Another key reason why Republican voters see no problem with these laws is their big safety valve: if you don't have an ID, well, then, be responsible and go get one! If, however, Republican voters are generally unaware of the high frequency of minorities, the poor, and the elderly lacking IDs, they are blissfully ignorant of the real costs of getting an ID. Yes, the ID itself is free for the indigent (to comport with the 24th Amendment's ban on poll taxes), but the documents one needs to get a photo ID aren't [18], and the prices haven't been reduced. Lost your naturalization certificate? That'll be $345. Don't have a birth certificate because you're black and were born in the segregated south? You have to go to court [19]. Similarly, Republican voters—and perhaps most others—tend not to be aware of how hard it can be to get an ID if you live in a state where DMV offices are far away or where they simply aren't open very often. One can only hope that would-be voters have access to a car or adequate public transportation, and a boss who won't mind if they take several hours off work to go get their ID, particularly if they live in, say, the third [20] of Texas counties that have no ID-issuing offices at all. I doubt that most Republican voters know that some Republican officials are taking steps to make it even harder to get that ID. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, to take an example, signed a strict voter ID law and then made a move to start closing [21] DMV offices in areas full of Democrats, while increasing office hours in areas full of Republicans—this in a state in which half of blacks and Hispanics are estimated to lack a driver's license and a quarter of its DMV offices are open less than one day per month [22]. (Sauk City's is open a whopping four [18] times a year.) Somehow I doubt that this is primarily about saving money. What To Do? One reason why voter ID laws are so politically successful is that they put Democrats in a weak position, forcing them to deny that in-person voter fraud exists or that it's a big deal. Republican voters and media [23] simply won't buy that. It doesn't matter how many times the evidence of the so-called threat has been shown [24] to be trumped up. It's a bad position to be in. Providing examples of Republicans committing fraud themselves—whether in-person [25] or, as in Massachusetts [26] and Florida [27], with absentee ballots [28] (a category curiously exempted from several of the Republican-inspired voter ID statutes)—won't provide a wake-up call either. Most Republican voters will shrug it off by saying, essentially, "everybody's doing it." If we can't talk about race, and Republican voters insist that these laws really are about fraud, then maybe Democrats should consider a different tack and embrace them to the full—so long as they are redesigned to do no harm. IDs would have to be truly free and easy to obtain. The poor should not be charged for the required documentation. More DMVs should be opened, particularly in poor neighborhoods and rural areas, and all DMVs should have evening and weekend hours so that no one has to miss work to get an ID. To be sure that the laws do no harm, how about mobile DMV units that could go straight to any area where people need IDs? Nursing homes, churches, senior centers, you name it. They could even register people to vote at the same time. Now that would be efficient—and democratic. No, wait, I've got it: How about a mandatory ID card? Every American would receive a photo ID as soon as he or she turns 18. That's it! A national ID card! Then voter ID laws would be the perfect thing, because we all want clean elections with high voter turnout, don't we? Something tells me, though, that Republicans won't go for it.</Msg><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1350396965750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:16:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350397371832-20</Id><Title>Inherent Racism in Democrats!</Title><Msg>Another day, another dirt-ball Democrat slings Racism!!

Earlier this week voting rights advocates–including the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights under Law and AFL-CIO–have called for the removal of the billboards. “These billboards are placed in predominately African American or Latino neighborhoods only,” said Eric Marshall of the Lawyers’ Committee. “They send a pretty strong message, and a very dissuasive message that is not good for our democracy.” On October 10, Clear Channel spokesperson Jim Cullinan said the company “understands the sensitivity of the signage and would start a dialogue with political leaders and community activists who have expressed their feelings about the billboards,” according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Today, however, the company said it has no plans to remove the ads, despite acknowledging that it was a mistake to sell the advertising space to an anonymous foundation, according to Washington Post‘s Election 2012 Blog. “Honestly it was a mistake of the specific sales person who agreed to that,” said Clear Channel spokesperson Jim Cullinan. “But once we put them up and signed a contract, we had to live with the anonymity. We understand there’s people upset. We’re working with the community.” “Voter intimidation is always wrong and it is outrageous in 2012 that an anonymous group is trying to scare Black voters away from the polls in a competitive election,”</Msg><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1350397472631</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:24:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350398795191-22</Id><Title>Voter ID is voter suppression</Title><Msg>By definition it is anti-democratic and it is fully embraced by the GOP.

Ronald Reagan’s budget director, David Stockman, takes a scalpel to the claims. Bain Capital is a product of the Great Deformation. It has garnered fabulous winnings through leveraged speculation in financial markets that have been perverted and deformed by decades of money printing and Wall Street coddling by the Fed. So Bain’s billions of profits were not rewards for capitalist creation; they were mainly windfalls collected from gambling in markets that were rigged to rise. Romney Mitt Romney was not a businessman; He was a master financial speculator who bought, sold, flipped, and stripped businesses. (Charles Ommanney / Getty Images) Nevertheless, Mitt Romney claims that his essential qualification to be president is grounded in his 15 years as head of Bain Capital, from 1984 through early 1999. According to the campaign’s narrative, it was then that he became immersed in the toils of business enterprise, learning along the way the true secrets of how to grow the economy and create jobs. The fact that Bain’s returns reputedly averaged more than 50 percent annually during this period is purportedly proof of the case—real-world validation that Romney not only was a striking business success but also has been uniquely trained and seasoned for the task of restarting the nation’s sputtering engines of capitalism. Except Mitt Romney was not a businessman; he was a master financial speculator who bought, sold, flipped, and stripped businesses. He did not build enterprises the old-fashioned way—out of inspiration, perspiration, and a long slog in the free market fostering a new product, service, or process of production. Instead, he spent his 15 years raising debt in prodigious amounts on Wall Street so that Bain could purchase the pots and pans and castoffs of corporate America, leverage them to the hilt, gussy them up as reborn “roll-ups,” and then deliver them back to Wall Street for resale—the faster the better. That is the modus operandi of the leveraged-buyout business, and in an honest free-market economy, there wouldn’t be much scope for it because it creates little of economic value. But we have a rigged system—a regime of crony capitalism—where the tax code heavily favors debt and capital gains, and the central bank purposefully enables rampant speculation by propping up the price of financial assets and battering down the cost of leveraged finance. So the vast outpouring of LBOs in recent decades has been the consequence of bad policy, not the product of capitalist enterprise. I know this from 17 years of experience doing leveraged buyouts at one of the pioneering private-equity houses, Blackstone, and then my own firm. I know the pitfalls of private equity. The whole business was about maximizing debt, extracting cash, cutting head counts, skimping on capital spending, outsourcing production, and dressing up the deal for the earliest, highest-profit exit possible. Occasionally, we did invest in genuine growth companies, but without cheap debt and deep tax subsidies, most deals would not make economic sense. the-great-deformation-book ‘The Great Deformation: How Crony Capitalism Corrupts Free Markets and Democracy’ by David A. Stockman. 400 pp. PublicAffairs. $29.99. In truth, LBOs are capitalism’s natural undertakers—vulture investors who feed on failing businesses. Due to bad policy, however, they have now become monsters of the financial midway that strip-mine cash from healthy businesses and recycle it mostly to the top 1 percent. The waxing and waning of the artificially swollen LBO business has been perfectly correlated with the bubbles and busts emanating from the Fed—so timing is the heart of the business. In that respect, Romney’s tenure says it all: it was almost exactly coterminous with the first great Greenspan bubble, which crested at the turn of the century and ended in the thundering stock-market crash of 2000-02. The credentials that Romney proffers as evidence of his business acumen, in fact, mainly show that he hung around the basket during the greatest bull market in recorded history. Needless to say, having a trader’s facility for knowing when to hold ’em and when to fold ’em has virtually nothing to do with rectifying the massive fiscal hemorrhage and debt-burdened private economy that are the real issues before the American electorate. Indeed, the next president’s overriding task is restoring national solvency—an undertaking that will involve immense societywide pain, sacrifice, and denial and that will therefore require “fairness” as a defining principle. And that’s why heralding Romney’s record at Bain is so completely perverse. The record is actually all about the utter unfairness of windfall riches obtained under our anti-free market regime of bubble finance. RIP VAN ROMNEY When Romney opened the doors to Bain Capital in 1984, the S&amp;P 500 stood at 160. By the time he answered the call to duty in Salt Lake City in early 1999, it had gone parabolic and reached 1270. This meant that had a modern Rip Van Winkle bought the S&amp;P 500 index and held it through the 15 years in question, the annual return (with dividends) would have been a spectacular 17 percent. Bain did considerably better, of course, but the reason wasn’t business acumen. The secret was leverage, luck, inside baseball, and the peculiar asymmetrical dynamics of the leveraged gambling carried on by private-equity shops. LBO funds are invested as equity at the bottom of a company’s capital structure, which means that the lenders who provide 80 to 90 percent of the capital have no recourse to the private-equity sponsor if deals go bust. Accordingly, LBO funds can lose 1X (one times) their money on failed deals, but make 10X or even 50X on the occasional “home run.” During a period of rising markets, expanding valuation multiples, and abundant credit, the opportunity to “average up” the home runs with the 1X losses is considerable; it can generate a spectacular portfolio outcome. In a nutshell, that’s the story of Bain Capital during Mitt Romney’s tenure. The Wall Street Journal examined 77 significant deals completed during that period based on fundraising documents from Bain, and the results are a perfect illustration of bull-market asymmetry. Overall, Bain generated an impressive $2.5 billion in investor gains on $1.1 billion in investments. But 10 of Bain’s deals accounted for 75 percent of the investor profits. Accordingly, Bain’s returns on the overwhelming bulk of the deals—67 out of 77—were actually lower than what a passive S&amp;P 500 indexer would have earned even without the risk of leverage or paying all the private-equity fees. Investor profits amounted to a prosaic 0.7X the original investment on these deals and, based on its average five-year holding period, the annual return would have computed to about 12 percent—well below the 17 percent average return on the S&amp;P in this period. By contrast, the 10 home runs generated profits of $1.8 billion on investments of only $250 million, yielding a spectacular return of 7X investment. Yet it is this handful of home runs that both make the Romney investment legend and also seal the indictment: they show that Bain Capital was a vehicle for leveraged speculation that was gifted immeasurably by the Greenspan bubble. It was a fortunate place where leverage got lucky, not a higher form of capitalist endeavor or training school for presidential aspirants. VICTORY FROM THE JAWS OF DEFEAT The startling fact is that four of the 10 Bain Capital home runs ended up in bankruptcy, and for an obvious reason: Bain got its money out at the top of the Greenspan boom in the late 1990s and then these companies hit the wall during the 2000-02 downturn, weighed down by the massive load of debt Bain had bequeathed them. In fact, nearly $600 million, or one third of the profits earned by the home-run companies, had been extracted from the hide of these four eventual debt zombies. The most emblematic among them was a roll-up deal focused on down-in-the-mouth department stores and apparel chains that were falling by the wayside in small-town America due to the arrival of Wal-Mart and the big-box retailers. Bain invested $10 million in 1988 and nine years later took out 18X its money—that is, a $175 million profit. Fittingly, Stage Stores Inc. was the last deal underwritten by the Drexel-Milken junk-bond machine before its demise. And the $300 million raised for this incipient LBO was exactly the kind of slush fund that Milken’s stable of takeover artists had used to acquire corporate castoffs and other bedraggled pots and pans that got rechristened as “growth” companies. During the next eight years, Bain slogged it out, accumulating about 300 small Main Street storefronts under such forgettable banners as Royal Palais, Bealls, and Fashion Bar. Yet the company wasn’t making much headway. By 1996, it had paid back none of the Milken debt and was only earning $14 million—exactly what it had generated back in 1992 on half the number of stores. In the spring of 1997, when Chairman Greenspan decided that “irrational exuberance” was not such a worrisome thing, Bain Capital decided to indulge, too. It caused Stage Stores Inc.—which was already publicly traded—to raise $300 million of new junk bonds and used the proceeds to buy a faltering 250-store chain of family clothing stores called C.R. Anthony. These 12,000-square-foot cracker-box stores sold mid-market shoes, shirts, and dresses right in Wal-Mart’s wheelhouse. In hot pursuit of “synergies,” Bain promptly rebranded these Anthony stores to the purportedly more compelling Stage and Bealls banners. While the name change did nothing to ward off the grim reaper from Bentonville, it suddenly gave Stage Stores Inc. the “growth” story that Greenspan’s bull market craved. Within five months of this ostensibly “transformative” deal and long before the results of the ritual “synergies” and “rebranding” could be determined, the company’s stock price had doubled. Bain Capital and its partner, Goldman Sachs, quickly unloaded their shares at the aforementioned 18X gain. As a matter of plain fact, the “transformative” C.R. Anthony deal was a bull-market scam. Almost immediately, results headed south. After growing 4 percent during the year of Bain’s quick 1997 exit, same-store sales turned to a negative 3 percent in 1998 and negative 7 percent in 1999, and were still falling when Stage Stores Inc. filed for bankruptcy shortly thereafter. The company hemorrhaged $150 million of negative cash flow during 1998-99—that is, during the two years after Bain and Goldman got out of Dodge City. Bain Capital subsequently claimed the company was “a growing, successful and consistently profitable company during the nine years we owned it” but then immediately ran into “operating problems.” That was a doozy by any other name but typical of the standard private-equity narrative that confuses speculators’ timing with real value creation on the free market. The fact is, the bad inventory and vastly overstated assets that took the company down did not suddenly materialize out of the blue during the 24 months after Bain’s exit: they were actually the result of financial-engineering games from the very beginning. Worse still, the Stage Stores deal embodied all of the hidden leverage that had become par for the course in the era of bubble finance. When the crunch came, the company had no assets to fall back on because Bain had hocked virtually everything; it sold all the company’s credit-card receivables to a third party, and among its 650 stores it owned exactly three! By my calculation, the capitalized debt embedded in its store leases was nearly $750 million and when added to its disclosed balance-sheet debt, the company’s true debt of was $1.3 billion or a devastating 25X its peak-year free cash flow. The bankruptcy forced the closure of about 250—or 40 percent—of the company’s stores and the loss of about 5,000 jobs. Yet the moral of the Stage Stores saga is not simply that in this instance Bain Capital was a jobs destroyer, not a jobs creator. The larger point is that it is actually a tale of Wall Street speculators toying with Main Street properties in defiance of sound finance—an anti-Schumpeterian project that used state-subsidized debt to milk cash from stores that would not have otherwise survived on the free market. Bain’s acclaimed success with another retailer—Staples—is also not what it is touted to be. Tom Stemberg was a visionary entrepreneur who got $5 million of seed money from Bain in 1986 when it was still in the venture-capital business; the Milken-style LBO schemes came later. As it happened, Bain exited the Staples deal after only a few years with a $15 million profit, a rounding error in the scheme of things. Stemberg made Staples a free-market success, a relentless generator of efficiency in the retail distribution of office supplies. Yet this honest capitalist efficiency, which benefited millions of customers, was achieved by a rampage of job destruction among tens of thousands of Main Street stationery and office-supplies stores and other traditional distributors. These now-defunct operations could not compete with Staples due to their high labor costs per dollar of sales—including upstream labor expense in the traditional, inefficient wholesale and distribution layers that stood behind Main Street retailers. Ironically, the businesses and jobs that Staples eliminated were the office-supply counterparts of the cracker-box stores selling shoes, shirts, and dresses that Bain kept on artificial life-support at Stage Stores Inc. At length, Wal-Mart eliminated these jobs and replaced them with back-of–the-store automation and front-end part-timers, as did Staples, which now has 40,000 part-time employees out of its approximate 90,000 total head count. The pointless exercise of counting jobs won and lost owing to these epochal shifts on the free market is obviously irrelevant to the job of being president, but the fact that Bain made $15 million from the winner and $175 million from the loser is evidence that it did not make a fortune all on its own. It had considerable help from the Easy Button at the Fed. THE $100 MILLION YELLOW PAD American Pad and Paper was a 20-bagger—that is, $5 million was invested in 1992 for a $100 million profit, a miraculous outcome for Bain, but hardly so for the Ampad workers and shareholders left holding the bag when the company went bankrupt in 1999 with massive debt. Ampad has been the focus of competing narratives in the election, but what it truly represents is neither jobs destroyed or saved—just an exercise in LBO cash-stripping that would not occur in an honest free market where the central bank was not in the tank for Wall Street. Ampad, owned by the giant paper conglomerate Mead Corporation, had plants in 14 states in the faintly archaic business of making notebooks, envelopes, file folders, and writing tablets—including the eponymous “yellow pad.” Not surprisingly, at a time when the Internet and paperless office were taking the world by storm, Mead discovered that Ampad was “not a good fit” and that its sale to Bain Capital was “an early step to increase productivity.” So the question recurred as to how spreadsheet-toting suits from Boston could resurrect what deeply experienced executives in Dayton, Ohio, knew to be a value-destroying sunset operation. The answer was leveraged financial engineering—that is, the roll-up of similar pots, pans, and discards for an eventual coming-out party on Wall Street. To this end, Mead perfumed the pig on the way out the door. In conjunction with a sweeping corporate “restructuring” program, 13 manufacturing and distribution facilities were consolidated into six and a $90 million “restructuring reserve” was established to cover asset write-downs and severance costs for upwards of a thousand terminated employees. So Bain Capital and the division’s senior management became the proud owner of a slimmed-down $100 million business that dominated the market for legal-sized yellow pads. Yet even with all of Mead’s pre-divestiture elimination of plants and jobs, Ampad’s earnings in 1991 (before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) amounted to the grand sum of $4.9 million. Mead also topped up Bain’s tiny $5 million equity investment with short-term financing and generous loans to the divested executives. But despite these Band-Aids from a big company trying to rid itself of a loser, the results showed that the suits from Boston had not moved the needle at all. By 1993, earnings had inched up only to $5.1 million—meaning that after 18 months of effort, Bain had come up with only $1 million of value gain at prevailing cash-flow multiples. Accordingly, it determined that yellow pads were not enough, and in the summer of 1994 it launched a spree of acquisitions hoping that accordion-file folders and business envelopes were the way of the future! The market was held to be large—amounting to some 169 billion envelopes per year—but the snag was they sold for only 1.6 cents each. To make a difference to its profits, therefore, Ampad needed to sell 10 billion to 15 billion envelopes a year. This turned out to not be a problem. Another group of leveraged operators had been at work for nine years consolidating the business-envelope sector under the Williamhouse umbrella and had accumulated numerous plants and properties. By 1995, the Williamhouse roll-up of envelope makers and distributors had accumulated $150 million of debt, about $250 million of sales, and a modest operating cash flow of about $16 million. So in October 1995, Bain again rolled the dice on a “transformative” acquisition. It spent $300 million acquiring Williamhouse, assuming all its heavy debt. The purchase price at 18X operating free cash flow was on the far edge of risky, but once again the putative “synergies” proved compelling to Bain’s bankers at the Bankers Trust Company. They refinanced all of the huge Williamhouse debts and provided an additional loan of $245 million. As it happened, Bain only needed $150 million to buy Williamhouse’s stock and pay the deal fees. So it sent its bankers a case of champagne and helped itself to a $60 million dividend in compensation for prospective “synergies” from a day-old merger. By year-end 1995, Ampad had added envelopes and accordion files to its yellow-pad portfolio, but in the process of its frenetic acquisitions, Bain had trashed the company’s balance sheet. Compared to $45 million of debt at year-end 1994, Ampad by June 2006 had 10X as much debt to service—$460 million! It therefore desperately needed the promised giant synergies, but, alas, they were not arriving as scheduled. Ampad generated barely enough operating income during the first six months of 1996 to cover its swollen interest payments, causing it to report a negligible 5 cents per share of net income. Yet since Bain Capital had now harvested a dividend that was 12X its original investment, it was basically home free—with a call option on either operational miracles or clever marketing and accounting. Not surprisingly, Bain opted for marketing and accounting razzmatazz. In June 1996, it launched an IPO at $15 per share—or about 150X its actual annualized rate of earnings during the first half of the year. The roadshow had an altogether different spin, however. The IPO boasted “pro forma” financials—that is, not actual sales and profits but “would have been” results. Thus, 1995 pro forma sales of $620 million reflected the full-year impact of its acquisitions—implying that Ampad was a born-again “growth” company. Compared to its actual sales of only $100 million in 1991, it had purportedly been growing at 53 percent annually. The fact that 90 percent of this growth was due to debt-funded acquisitions was presumably to be overlooked. The magic wand, however, came in the pro forma “adjustments” to earnings. The company had actually reported 1995 operating earnings of a scant $1.5 million and a net loss after interest and taxes, but in a five-page bridge table that was a wonder to behold, the offering prospectus detailed several dozen pro forma adjustments that envisaged the newly minted amalgamation of companies—Ampad-Williamhouse-Globe-Weis-Niagara—as a gusher of profits. Its interest costs had tripled, but thanks to “synergies,” cost savings, and future operating improvements, the $1.5 million of actual 1995 earnings were to be viewed—through the lens of pro forma magic—as $57 million of operating income. This $57 million result included a lot of chickens that had not yet hatched. For example, $8.5 million of higher operating income was to be from the Niagara Envelope acquisition that had not actually finalized as of the IPO prospectus. Likewise, a savings of $4.5 million was cited from closing Williamhouse’s New York City headquarters, even though rent and severance costs several times greater were buried in purchase accounting and would be paid for years to come. Yet by July 1996, the Greenspan stock-market bubble had a good head of steam. This meant that Ampad had no trouble selling nearly $250 million of stock based on a prospectus riddled with pro forma adjustments to the point of incomprehensibility, and a growth story that strained credulity. Bain Capital was able to sell to credulous IPO punters another $50 million of its stock, bringing its return to over $100 million and the fabled 20-bagger. Meanwhile, the hedge-fund speculators pumped the company’s stock to a peak of $26 per share by late summer of 1996, making all the more evident that the Ampad deal was really about speculative mania on Wall Street, not a revival of “Old Yeller” from the bits and pieces of a dying industry. The company’s combined debt and equity was then being valued at $1.1 billion—or a fantastic 35X the $30 million of operating free cash flow (EBITDA less capital expenditure) that Ampad actually posted during 1997. However, within weeks of the IPO and a profits warning, the fast money smelled the rat and followed Bain in scampering off the listing ship. Margins were being squeezed by the superstores faster than the promised synergies could be realized. By early 1999, the stock was delisted and when the company was finally liquidated in bankruptcy shortly thereafter, secured lenders recovered about $100 million and other creditors got zero—that is, the company was worth about 10 percent of its peak valuation. Once again, the moral of the story is about the ill effects of bad public policy, not just that smarter speculators like Bain bagged the slower-witted. To be sure, private-equity sponsors usually don’t make huge profits on busted deals. I lost a bundle when my auto-supplier investment went bankrupt, and was prosecuted for fraud to boot. But the government eventually dropped the charges entirely because in the end it was a case of way too much leverage and bad timing in the midst of an auto-industry collapse that took down GM, Chrysler, and nearly every major supplier too. The lesson is that LBOs are just another legal (and risky) way for speculators to make money, but they are dangerous because when they fail, they leave needless economic disruption and job losses in their wake. That’s why LBOs would be rare in an honest free market—it’s only cheap debt, interest deductions, and ludicrously low capital-gains taxes that artifically fuel them. The larger point is that Romney’s personal experience in the nation’s financial casinos is no mark against his character or competence. I’ve made money and lost it and know what it is like to be judged. But that experience doesn’t translate into answers on the great public issues before the nation, either. The Romney campaign’s feckless narrative that private equity generates real economic efficiency and societal wealth is dead wrong. A $165 MILLION SCORE ON EXPERIAN In September 1996, Bain Capital and some partners bought Experian, the consumer-credit-reporting division of TRW Inc., for $1.1 billion. But Bain ponied up only $88 million in equity along with a similar amount from partners; all the rest of the funding came from junk bonds and bank loans. Seven weeks later, they sold it to a British conglomerate for $1.7 billion, producing a $600 million profit for all the investors on their slim layer of equity capital and after not even enduring the inconvenience of unpacking their briefcases. Quite obviously Bain generated zero value before it flipped the property. So the fact that it scalped a sudden and spectacular $165 million windfall has nothing to do with investment skill or even trading prowess. Instead, the Experian Corp.’s $600 million valuation gain in just 50 days was an inside job. That explains how a division put on the auction block by one of the nation’s most prominent dealmakers, CEO Joseph Gorman, could have been so badly mispriced in the initial sale to Bain Capital and its partners—that is, how they got it for just 65 percent of what the property fetched only months later. In fact, the original auction had been run by Bear Stearns—and it became evident in March 2008 that Bear Stearns had never been in the client-service business; it had been in the brass-knuckled trading business, where it used its balance sheet to underwrite and trade immensely profitable “risk assets.” Not surprisingly, the private-equity houses were the premier source of profits for its trading and capital-markets desks—so its “investment bankers” needed little encouragement about where to steer corporate-divestiture deals. In that endeavor, they got plenty of help from the inside management of spun-off divisions, which were usually marketed as a “key asset” of the business and eager to participate in the prospective LBO. Thus, Experian’s CEO, D. Van Skilling, and his lieutenants reaped millions from this Wall Street-orchestrated windfall before they had even been issued new business cards. Oblivious to the irony, however, Skilling defended Bain’s instant $165 million profit by insisting to Business Insider “there was never a hint of financial chicanery at all.” He had that upside down. The deal was pure chicanery, but not because the private-equity investors were underhanded. It was because they were artificially enabled by the central banking and taxing branches of the state—the true source of this kind of rent-a-company speculation. THE WESLEY-JESSEN HOME RUN Wesley-Jessen was a small specialist firm that did reasonably well in cosmetic eye-color lenses and toric lenses to correct astigmatism. In mid-1995, when Schering-Plough Corp. put it on the block, Bain Capital invested $6 million and reaped a $300 million profit for itself by 1999—making nearly 50X its investment in the same number of months. On an apples-to-apples basis, however, the company’s operating income rose by only 2X during the same period, by my calculations. The rest of the gain was due to massive leverage, the Greenspan bubble, and accounting moves that can fairly be called myopic. Bain employed a hoary old dodge—having its accountants write off every dime of plant, equipment, and intangible know-how, reassigning roughly $40 million to the inventory accounts, and then charging it to income in the immediate two or three quarters. This trick eliminated all future depreciation, thereby magically adding $14 million to the pro forma operating income on Wesley-Jessen’s $100 million of sales. Investors were promptly told to ignore the resulting losses, of course, since these inventory charges were “non-recurring”! In fact, savings from pre-deal “restructuring” actions by the seller, plus the accounting magic, generated $24 million of freshly minted “operating income” before Bain’s turnaround squad even showed up at the company’s headquarters. The alleged “turnaround” of Wesley-Jessen was thus largely an artifact of Bain’s PR machine. In the fourth quarter of 1996, the company borrowed $70 million to acquire a competitor, Barnes-Hind, from Pilkington plc. Before the ink was dry on the merger contract, Bain filed an IPO prospectus. While Barnes-Hind had an operating loss of $17 million the year before the merger, its results for that period were improved by $23 million owing to Bain’s pro forma adjustments—creating the appearance of another dramatic turnaround. During the 12 months ending at the merger date, the combined companies had actually incurred a net loss of $27 million, but it vanished with the help of $50 million in pre-tax adjustments for merger accounting and prospective savings. So its pro forma earnings took on a decisively improved aura; it would have booked a $14 million profit, or about $0.73 per share. Not surprisingly, the stock market eagerly scooped up $45 million of new shares at $15, or 20X these gussied-up earnings, just in time for the Fed to begin a new round of goosing in March 1997. And that proved propitious for Bain. Almost to the day on which its 180-day IPO lockup expired, it sold its first batch of shares in a secondary offering in a now red-hot stock market at a red-hot price that was up 60 percent from the IPO. Wesley-Jessen had not then filed financial statements with even $1 of GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) net income. But when Bain’s underwriters wired the proceeds in August 1997 the selling price was $23.50 per share. That’s 52X the $0.43 per share it had paid for the stock 25 months earlier. At the end of the day, massive leverage, fancy accounting, and bubble finance, not entrepreneurial prowess, were the source of Bain’s 50-bagger. THE ITALIAN JOB In November 1997, Bain Capital pulled off a veritable capitalist heist in the socialist redoubts of the Italian Yellow Pages. On a $17 million investment in the Italian phone book, it took out a profit of $375 million. This was not only a 22-bagger; for Mitt Romney, it was the ultimate in no-sweat riches. According to the company’s CEO, Romney’s sole involvement was a cameo appearance during a due-diligence session: “He came into the room, asked a couple of very sharp questions immediately, shook hands and left.” Twenty-eight months later, in February 2000, Romney’s former colleagues at Bain located him during his tour of duty in Salt Lake City, where they wired his share of the winnings: a reputed $50 million. Bain and a syndicate of private-equity houses were originally brought in as a stalking horse to validate the government’s “privatization” machinations. At the time, the key Italian Treasury official was one Mario Draghi (now president of the European Central Bank). His assignment was to get the nation’s huge deficit down to a Maastricht Treaty–compliant 3 percent, and he elected to do so by means of a rent-a-balance-sheet ploy of the type then in favor. The short story is that Bain and the other investors paid 5X the company’s operating income for their shares, and were paid 100X operating income to leave when local circumstances obviated the need for the rental deal. That preposterous multiple expansion accounted for virtually all of Bain’s 22-bagger. In the interim, the dotcom bubble reached it fevered peak—so Italy’s lumbering phone-book publisher had puffed itself up as a fleet-footed Internet company, claiming to be the next AOL. In the fog of 1999’s worldwide financial bubbles, a group of corporate raiders who did not have two nickels to rub together then got control of Italy’s storied typewriter maker, Olivetti, and parleyed massive borrowings through that vehicle into control of the Italian phone company. Now hoist atop a stupendous house of cards, the raiders next went after Italy’s gussied-up Yellow Pages, paying $24 billion—or 180X net income—for a business that was slithering into the sunset. In fact, it is currently worth perhaps 1 percent of Bain’s exit price through a deal that top-ticked Greenspan’s NASDAQ bubble in February 2000. Never have a group of private-equity men laughed more heartily on the way to the bank. The Bain Capital investments here reviewed accounted for $1.4 billion or 60 percent of the fund’s profits over 15 years, by my calculations. Four of them ended in bankruptcy; one was an inside job and fast flip; one was essentially a massive M&amp;A brokerage fee; and the seventh and largest gain—the Italian Job—amounted to a veritable freak of financial nature. In short, this is a record about a dangerous form of leveraged gambling that has been enabled by the failed central banking and taxing policies of the state. That it should be offered as evidence that Mitt Romney is a deeply experienced capitalist entrepreneur and job creator is surely a testament to the financial deformations of our times.</Msg><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1350399984515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:06:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350400074395-26</Id><Topic><Title>Inherent Racism in Democrats!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350397371832</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:22:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Queer for bikers" likes to ride on the seat post.</Msg><Username>lonelygaybillie</Username><Timestamp>1350400074395</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:07:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350400307024-27</Id><Title>Stockman is a Criminal!!!</Title><Msg>Stockman slipped out of going to jail, Barely..

Speaking on CNN’s “Starting Point,” Zandi acknowledged a study by the Tax Policy Center that shows Romney’s plan to lower taxes by 20 percent across the board, while making up those losses in government revenue by closing loopholes on the wealthy, doesn’t add up. Zandi even went so far as to say that “the arithmetic doesn’t work as it is right now”: ZANDI: Yeah, I think the Tax Policy Center study is the definitive study. They’re non-partisan, they’re very good. They say given the numbers that they’ve been provided by the Romney campaign, no, it will not add up. Now, the Romney campaign could adjust their plan. They could say okay I’m not going to lower tax rates as much as I’m saying right now and they could make the arithmetic work. But under the current plan, with the current numbers, no it doesn’t. I’ll say one other thing, though. I think it is important that we do focus on the so-called tax expenditures in the tax code. Those are the deductions, and credits, and loopholes in the code. We need to reduce those, because if we do we’re going to make the tax system fairer, easier to understand and ultimately lead to stronger growth. So that’s the right place to focus. But, no, the arithmetic doesn’t work as it is right now. Watch it: Closing all the loopholes and ending all of the deductions currently given to the wealthy does not make up for the losses of giving everyone in the country, particularly the wealthy, another tax break. The only way Romney’s plan will not add to the deficit is if middle class families pay over $2,000 more in taxes annually.</Msg><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1350401301986</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:28:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350401598730-30</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo: Where's the 'BUDGET"???</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349448844285</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:54:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe Commie-economist Mark Zandi can help Dumbo find a budget!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350401598730</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:33:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350402094138-31</Id><Title>Stockman trashes Ryan</Title><Msg>REPUBLICAN DAVID STOCKMAN: Paul Ryan's Budget Is An Empty Fairy Tale Henry Blodget | Aug. 14, 2012, 6:49 AM Barack Obama The former director of the Office of Management and Budget for the Reagan administration, David Stockman, blasts Paul Ryan's budget plan in a New York Times op-ed. Stockman calls the budget an "empty conservative sermon" and "fairy tale" and says it will "do nothing to reverse the nation's economic decline and arrest its fiscal collapse." Stockman's main complaint about the Ryan budget, which reflects broader frustration with today's Republican party, is that it preserves massive and unnecessary spending on Defense and other programs while screwing people who actually need help by cutting food stamps, Medicaid, and other poverty-mitigation efforts. Stockman also rails against the new "Wall Street-coddling" bailout Republicans like Ryan, who stand by and let the Federal Reserve fix interest rates, encourage speculators, crush savers, encourage overconsumption, and punish thrift. Specifically, Stockman observes, Ryan's "phony" budget plan: Maintains Defense spending that is nearly twice the $400 billion (adjusted for today's dollars) that General Eisenhower spent in the 1960s Shreds the safety net provided by $100 billion in food stamps and $300 billion in Medicaid Does not cut one dime from Medicare or Social Security for another decade Includes no serious plan to create jobs Radically cuts taxes on the richest Americans while eliminating tax breaks that mostly help the middle class Fails to even consider a "value-added sales tax," which is the only way the country can begin to climb out of its budget hole In short, Stockman says, Ryan's plan is "devoid of credible math or hard policy choices." Harsh words coming from a fellow Republican. But then, today's Republican party doesn't look much like it did in Stockman and Reagan's day.</Msg><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1350402094138</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:41:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350402311600-32</Id><Topic><Title>Stockman is a Criminal!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350400307024</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 11:11:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Partner at 'Blackstone' stock brokerage..

The only "fog" is in Obama's head. ** blaming the "fog of war** Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the buck stops with her when it comes to who is to blame for security ahead of a deadly assault on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. "I take responsibility" for what happened on September 11, Clinton said in an interview with CNN's Elise Labott soon after arriving in Lima, Peru for a visit. The Obama administration has been heavily criticized after Vice President Joe Biden said during last week's vice presidential debate that the White House did not know of requests to enhance security at Benghazi, contradicting testimony by State Department employees that requests had been made and rejected. Following the debate, the White House said the vice president did not know of the requests because they were handled, as is the practice, by the State Department. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took responsibility Monday night for any security failures leading up to the consulate attack last month in Libya that killed an the American ambassador, but she seemed to push back against claims of a cover-up, blaming the "fog of war" for the Obama administration's shifting explanations for the attack.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1350411497675</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:18:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350411510685-59</Id><Topic><Title>Inherent racism in Voter ID</Title><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1350396965750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 10:16:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Some African American, Spanish-speaking and elderly voters in Florida and Virginia are apparently being targeted by anonymous voter-suppression groups trying to trick them or intimidate them into not voting in the November presidential election, according to election officials and voter protection organizations. The Virginia State Board of Elections is warning residents that "some Virginia voters, particularly older Virginians, are receiving phone calls from unidentified individuals informing voters that they can vote over the phone. This information is false." In Florida, the 866-OUR-VOTE election protection hotline run by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law has received a report of a similar calls in Florida. The lawyers' committee is also investigating reports from callers into African-American and Spanish-language radio stations in Florida that they had received warnings over the phone that election officials would be checking car insurance and registration status at the polls. Attempts to deceive members of certain demographic groups into not voting have become an unfortunate staple of the American electoral process, but they normally don't start until much closer to Election Day, said Eric Marshall, manager of legal mobilization at the lawyers' committee. In Florida, the voter who alerted the hotline described a phone call in which the caller said that a new law has passed that allows voters to vote by phone with just a name and address, he said. The caller knew the voter’s name, address and party affiliation. Marshall said the caller evidently had access to voter rolls, and read back the information "to make it sound more official." "This isn't necessarily a new tactic," he said. "But it's early." And just to be clear: "You cannot vote by phone," Marshall said. What has changed the trickster calendar? "I guess with the increase of early voting, they're moving these types of tactics up earlier," Marshall said. People who get such calls should try to get as much information about the call as possible, he said. They should get the caller's phone number and ask questions about where they're calling from. If the call is a recording, they should record it, and then report it to 866-OUR-VOTE, Marshall said. Other historical attempts at voter suppression have included calls, fliers and even door-to-door campaigns trying to trick people into not going to vote. One of the most infamous attempts was in Virginia in 2008, when a flier was distributed telling Democrats they were supposed to vote on Wednesday, not Tuesday. The disinformation campaign would appear to be a sort of illegal corollary to the Republican-backed campaign to demand photo identification from voters. What opponents say they seem to have in common is an intent to particularly block or dissuade African American, Latino and elderly voters from casting ballots.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350411510685</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:18:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350411516880-60</Id><Topic><Title>Are Mitt's tax plan details also hidden in a Cayman Island bank or what?</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1350411054732</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:10:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how does the Romney-Ryan tax plan cut taxes by $5 trillion without raising taxes on the middle class or exploding the deficit,?

The difference is that in Reagan's day taxes were higher than they are now. Regardless, taxes need to be raised and benefits reduced to pay off the deficit and debt.

Thousands of dollars more per family, according to the authors,” the CNN host added. But recently Romney told NBC’s David Gregory that the Tax Policy Center was biased and that he had “five different economic studies, including one oat Harvard, Princeton and AEI and a couple at the Wall Street Journal” to back his proposal. Romney later increased that total to six studies while facing President Barack Obama at the first presidential debate. .............. “The suggestion is that these are full-blown academic studies,” Cooper noted on Monday. “Actually, three are blog posts, one is a Wall Street Journal op-ed. In the Wall Street Journal piece, Martin Feldstein, who’s also a campaign advisor, makes the math work but only by using a different definition of middle class than Mr. Romney uses in his own plan.”</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350414212498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350414255700-72</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo-crats: YOUR TAXES WILL GO UP!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350411901899</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:25:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Spend lots on horribly obsolete tech like 'Windmills' and Everready Bunny batteries!!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350414255700</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:04:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350414585121-73</Id><Title>Lyin' Ryan wastes water</Title><Msg>President of St. Vincent De Paul Society blasts Ryan visit as 'publicity stunt' 31 Comments Email Print Published: Mon, October 15, 2012 @ 6:22 p.m. YOUNGSTOWN ­­— The president of Mahoning County’s St. Vincent De Paul Society is “shocked” and “angry” that Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan used the soup kitchen for a “publicity stunt.” Brian J. Antal, who runs the society, said today the campaign “ramrodded themselves in there” without getting proper permission for the visit Saturday that followed Ryan’s town-hall meeting at Youngstown State University. Juanita Sherba, St. Vincent’s Saturday coordinator for the dinning hall, said she gave the Ryan campaign approval that day for the visit by the candidate and his family. Sherba say she now realizes it wasn’t her call to make. The event “was a photo op,” she said. “It was the phoniest piece of baloney I’ve ever been associated with. In hindsight, I would have never let him in the door.” The event was completely staged by the campaign, she said. When asked for a comment, Christopher Maloney, spokesman for the Romney/Ryan campaign, said: “Our campaign and Congressman Ryan were pleased to bring attention to the meaningful charitable contributions St. Vincent De Paul Society makes to people in need.”</Msg><Username>fritzinacrotchlesstutu</Username><Timestamp>1350414585121</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:09:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350414929165-74</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Forced Kids into Drugs !</Title><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1350404071090</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:14:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hopefully, this will be exposed along with Mitt's taxes.</Msg><Username>monsewer_america</Username><Timestamp>1350414929165</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:15:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350415135350-75</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo Ate Dog AND Forced Kids into Drugs!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350404425420</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:20:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tax returns, Cayman islands..your back to that?

Trimming back on eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, as food stamps are called, would save $4 billion over the decade. Republicans are pushing to reduce that even more. ... "Is the benefit going to the right people? Is the money being expended wisely?" questioned Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), who has led efforts to change the program, during a recent Senate speech. "Is it encouraging people to look for ways to be productive and be responsible for their families? Or does it create dependency on a series of government programs?" Senator Sessions, that question is offensive. It's especially offensive when you recognize that a significant number of Americans who rely on Food Stamps to feed their families, are working full-time but are not being paid enough by their employers to survive on. So of course the benefit isn't going to "the right people," or being "spent wisely," because it's going to line the pockets of billionaires and their billion-dollar corporations! So we have a question for you, Senator Sessions: » When will Republicans in Congress take up legislation that imposes severe fines on mulit-billion dollar corporations who line their pockets at the expense of taxpayers by refusing to pay their employees a 2012 wage and use government programs to supplement their payrolls? -------------------- Citizens from whom Walmart is stealing to pay their employees want our money back from WALMART, not starving children. Here's what Walmart's intentionally low wages are costing hard-working taxpayers like us: Walmart's intentionally low wages force hard-working employees to need approximately $420,000 per year, per store, totalling $2.66 BILLION annually in Food Stamps and other taxpayer assistance ... to survive. Walmart's intentionally low wages cost the country HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of dollars in payroll tax deductions for Federal, State, and Local taxes. Walmart's intentionally low wages cost our communities the ability to hire and retain important public service workers like firefighters, police officers, maintenance workers, and teachers. Walmart's intentionally low wages cost our communities with their increased need for those same public services they are underfunding. Walmart's intentionally low wages and lack of covered benefits cost taxpayers over $1.02 BILLION a year in healthcare costs. Walmart's intentionally low wages cost taxpayers as much as $225 MILLION in free and reduced price lunches for school-age children. Walmart's intentionally low wages cost taxpayers over $780 MILLION in tax deductions for low-income families. And that's just some of the burden placed on taxpayers by Walmart's intentionally low wages. That's not Welfare for People, That's Welfare for Walmart at The People's expense!</Msg><Username>spenditol98_1</Username><Timestamp>1350419220104</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:27:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350419410340-96</Id><Topic><Title>Voters Don't care about Caymans and ADDITIONAL tax stuff</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1350417731909</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:02:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You call President Romney a 'crook'.

Not quite By Walt De Vries From 1961 through 1967, Walter De Vries served George Romney as a campaign strategist during Romney's terms as Michigan governor; heading campaign research and strategy for three campaigns and as executive assistant in the office of the governor. He is co-author, with Lance Tarrance, of the "Ticket Splitters," a ground-breaking look at the behavior of independent voters. He also was the founder of the North Carolina Institute of Political Leadership. Like after the first debate, sometime after the second debate with President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney, one of Romney's surrogates and spin-misters or Mitt himself, will harken to Romney's father, the late Michigan Gov. George Romney to reinforce an aura of integrity around the GOP candidate. After the first debate it was wife Ann who said that Mitt had written "Dad" on paper he had at the lectern. Mrs. Romney, described as choking up during a post-debate interview with CNN, said it signified that Mitt respected what his father "taught me and what kind of person you are and I'm going to honor that." While that might make for some good post-debate spin, perhaps exploitation of his late father's memory and dramatic television, the conduct of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign is a far cry from the kind of campaign and conduct, as a public servant, I saw during the seven years I worked in George Romney's campaigns and served him as governor. There are some similarities - and they are admirable. Both men's lives are characterized by energy and hard work. They both have been faithful to their religion, the primacy of family and ability to sell what he believes. Both were exempt from military service - George during World War II when he was Managing Director of the Automotive Council for War Production; and Mitt with draft exemptions as a student and Mormon missionary in France But it is Mitt's behavior during this presidential campaign that is distinguishing - and not those of his father at all. Since 2005, when he first decided to seek the presidency, his political posture and positions have shifted in erratic and startling ways, to the right, to the middle, to the right and shifting still. George Romney's strength as a politician and public officeholder was his ability and determination to develop and hold consistent policy positions over his life. While it seems that Mitt would say and do anything to close a deal - or an election. George Romney's constant mantra to those in and around his campaigns and his gubernatorial staff: "As you campaign, so shall you govern." When George Romney launched his first campaign for governor, facing an entrenched Democratic machine with strong labor backing, he determined he'd reach out to independent voters - those who voted for Democrats and Republicans - ticket-splitters. For George, how you campaigned really mattered. How you communicated with voters, the positions you took, the persons on your campaign staff, and those you took contributions from, were an extension of the candidate's personality. George Romney reached out to voters in union halls and factory gates, a rare venue for GOP candidates back then and still now. He refused to engage in personal attacks and kept his campaigns issue-based. Mitt Romney and the people around him see campaigns as television marketing and voters as targets to be manipulated. Voters, they believe, make up their minds late and will be swayed with saturation television advertising. The campaign managers seek - daily it seems - for a magic bullet to force on the electorate that will move undecided and weak voters to Romney. Policy papers, positions are rare and short on content and meaning. I've tried to track Mitt Romney's shifts - some 180 degrees others 360 -- on key issues during the campaign. I've stopped at 30: abortion, stem-cell research; climate change and global warming; campaign finance; and equal pay for women are just a few. George Romney was a political risk-taker. He fought for a new Michigan constitution that was narrowly approved, overhauled the administrative structure of the executive branch in Michigan and battled repeatedly for an income tax. His campaigns were uphill - particularly in 1964 when he faced the Lyndon Johnson national landslide. In that year he increased his plurality while the rest of the GOP ticket was crushed. "As you campaign, so shall you govern." That lesson from father to son, seems to be lost in the win-at-any-cost fog of politics in the 21st century.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350420211656</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:43:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350420282680-102</Id><Topic><Title>'Dumbo Phones' are for Crack heads</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349128249942</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 17:50:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here Ya Go... YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS At approximately 2:30 pm, September 6, 2012, I entered the Publix store on Main St. in Gainesville, FL to pick up a few items. I gathered my items and went to the 14 and under register to check-out. The person in front of me (a white female, approximate age 35-43, fake nails, big braided hair do, clean clothes, carrying a purse and a plastic drinking cup) put her purchase on the check-out surface – ONE GRAPE. Yes, that is correct ONE GRAPE. The cashier asked if that was all, she replied yes. The cashier then weighted the GRAPE and told the women the cost w#$%$02 (TWO CENTS), the women then pulled out her Food Stamp EBT card and swiped it through the credit card machine, requesting $24.00 in cash back. The cashier asked if she wanted the GRAPE, the woman replied no and the GRAPE was put in the garbage can. The register recorded the sale #$%$02, cash back $24.00. The cashier then asked if fives would be okay because was out of tens, the woman agreed and took the $24.00 folded it up and put it in her pocket and left the store. As the next person in line I asked the cashier as a tax payer what in the [beeep] just happened here she said she was on the clock and could not comment. I then asked if I had actually seen this person purchase and discard a GRAPE, then get cash back on her Food Stamp EBT card. The cashier responded that it happens all day, every day in their store. She also said that if the person buying the GRAPE has it ring up over $.02 they get mad and make her reweigh it. My next comment was to ask the cashier if she planned to vote in November and she said she could hardly wait for 11/6/12 to get here as one tax payer to another. I paid for my groceries, in cash, and left the store madder than 10 wet hens. Now you know one of the reasons why America is broke, and why the 49% of Americans who actually pay federal income taxes have had enough and we will not put up with this any longer. Oh, just so we’re clear on this: Barry Soetoro Steven Dunham Hussein Obama has no problems with this fraud and actually is aiding and abetting welfare abuse by removing Clinton’s work requirement from welfare recipients.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350420282680</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:44:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350420450147-103</Id><Title>HEY JB!...Are Ya Gonna Watch Yer Boss Get Trounced Tonight?</Title><Msg>Better start boning up of Burger Flipping cuz yer gonna need a new job Soon!...</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350420450147</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:47:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350420468892-104</Id><Title>Desperate Dumbo 'Hope and Changers' dredging for help!!!</Title><Msg>These extremely long Posts by Dumbo's PINK-o troops are funny.

Mr. Perot's 1992 campaign elevated the budget deficit to the forefront of politics, and six years later the federal government notched its first surplus in decades. "At stake is nothing less than our position in the world, our standard of living at home and our constitutional freedoms," Mr. Perot said in a statement released by the Romney campaign. "That is why I am endorsing Mitt Romney in his quest for the presidency. We can't afford four more years in which national debt mushrooms out of control, our government grows, and our military is weakened. Mitt has the background, experience, intelligence and integrity to turn things around. He has my absolute support." Like Mr. Romney this year, Mr. Perot made the argument in 1992 that the country needed a businessman to take control and execute a turnaround. Mr. Perot also wrote an op-ed for the Des Moines Register laying out his thinking. He called the economy "stagnant" and pointed to the same deficit trajectory that pushed him to enter the race in 1992. "It is this massive deficit spending that threatens to undermine our future standard of living. To pay for our government's massive debts, Washington's profligacy, our children and grandchildren will be paying interest and principal on the nation's debt for untold years into the future. That is wrong. It's not the way America ought to be," he wrote.
