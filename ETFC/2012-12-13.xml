If they were then upper management wouldn't have been able to do that recent big buy. They'd have been in a quiet period. So if such a deal is in the works it would have had to be initiated sometime in the last two months, which means it'd still be almost too preliminary to even merit a rumor. And, the shock may well go down into the $7 range, in fact you should consider it a serious probability, at least for awhile. The game changes when the quarters earnings stop being burdened with special charges. It's worth holding, but always keep room in your reserves for it to drop fractionally before going back up. I'm long as well, but I'm long because of the long term potential of the company, not because of its short term "issues". I buy and sell around a permanent long position trading the swings between earnings reports once the trading range has been established. It's boring, REALLY boring, but you can make some money doing it.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1355420979689</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 12:49:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355422527977-8</Id><Topic><Title>When most of us came up the American Dream was within reach</Title><Username>cowboysamsuxballs</Username><Timestamp>1355411947585</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:19:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lettem laugh, Lettem laugh, Lettem laugh, as the last laugh will be on them. When they hit resource depletion we'll still have centuries of materials in our "protected" national parks and the vast explored interior of Alaska. Not to mention offshore petroleum reserves that because of excessive environmental regulation would have remained untapped. If I thought the environmentalists were so smart as to actually PLAN this aftereffect, I might have joined up with them, for as a national strategy exchanging a fiat currency for natural resources is a BIG win for the person who gets the natural resources.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1355422527977</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 13:15:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355426525876-9</Id><Topic><Title>When most of us came up the American Dream was within reach</Title><Username>cowboysamsuxballs</Username><Timestamp>1355411947585</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 10:19:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>**We had it better than our parents.

Look at the homebuilders they are now building houses with casita's(spanish for small house) to accomadate their children and parents moving back in with them. With the government barrowing $0.46 on every dollar spent and the minority population slated to become the majority you can say good by to the Great American Experiment. As the saying goes "when you borrow from Peter to pay Paul, you can always depend on Paul's support."</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1355426525876</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 14:22:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355436385389-10</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone having trouble logging into Etrade today?</Title><Username>z28barnett</Username><Timestamp>1355408791512</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 09:26:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not logging in, but there was some latency not associated with my network.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1355436385389</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 17:06:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355446967626-11</Id><Title>Fess up</Title><Msg>Who voted this idiot in again....

That isn't leadership, it's epic incompetence .” Reports today show that HB 4003, which the Governor said would provide “Right to Work” type policies for public employees in Michigan, could not be implemented as intended as the Michigan Constitution gives clear authority to the Civil Service Commission over conditions of employment for the state's workforce. Experts have suggested today only a vote of the Civil Service Commission could enact Right to Work policies for state workers. “The public was not given an opportunity to read these bills, legislators were not given an opportunity to read these bills, and we now know that the Governor himself either didn't read or didn't understand these bills himself,” said Senator Bert Johnson (D – Detroit). “This process has been a complete affront to Democracy from the start and was nothing more than a political gift to the Koch Brothers and ALEC who bought and paid for this legislation.” A series of questions have been raised in recent days over the legality of the “Right to Work” legislation as well as the process in which it passed. A lawsuit has already been filed against the Michigan House of Representatives for violating the Open Meetings Act as these bills were passed while the public was illegally locked out of the State Capitol and additional legal challenges are expected in the coming days.</Msg><Username>milton_friedrnan</Username><Timestamp>1355454323286</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 22:05:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
