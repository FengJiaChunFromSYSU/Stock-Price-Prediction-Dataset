After going through Romney's gaffes and the reactions they elicited, O'Donnell said that the former Massachusetts governor reminded him of Sarah Palin. "It started to occur to me last night, actually, when I was listening to his answers to Brian Williams' interview," O'Donnell said.

"So you have this short-covering that drives prices up." That helps explain the rise in stocks in the 24 hours prior to the U.S. central bank's policy decisions - a pattern that tends to hold irrespective of what the Fed actually says in its statement. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York performed a study of the pattern. Starting mid-afternoon the day before such decisions, stocks in the United States, Britain, Germany and other major markets begin a sharp rise and don't stop, on average, until just before the Fed unveils its policy decision at 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT) the following day."</Msg><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1343496031000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 13:20:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343496470000-25</Id><Topic><Title>Next Week: Financials will lead market!</Title><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1343495565000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 13:12:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$7.53 --&gt; $7.88 --&gt; 8.20 --&gt; 8.71 --&gt; 9.25 This can happen in two weeks or so!!

The filing disclosed that Modus had operations on four continents, including Asian facilities in Singapore, Taiwan, China and South Korea, and European facilities in Ireland and France, and a center in Australia.[...] According to a news release issued by Modus Media in 1997, its expansion of outsourcing services took place in close consultation with Bain. Terry Leahy, Modus’s chairman and chief executive, was quoted in the release as saying he would be “working closely with Bain on strategic expansion.”. Other companies that Bain invested in sent jobs all over the world, including to Ireland and Mexico, while Romney has tried to claim that Bain was all about creating jobs and turning around American companies that otherwise would have gone under. As one of Romney’s former partners put it,”I never thought of what I do for a living as job creation…The primary goal of private equity is to create wealth for your investors.” And that’s what Bain did, even if it meant helping companies move operations to the same country Romney now blasts for stealing American jobs. While the Romney campaign declined to comment for the article, they offered a laughable response today: outsourcing is different than offshoring. In other words, they didn’t dispute one iota of the substance of the story, but instead wanted to split hairs over semantics. WHY IT MATTERS: While it’s troubling that Mitt Romney amassed a quarter-billion dollar fortune by bankrupting companies, laying off workers, and sending jobs overseas, where his policies would take America is of even greater concern. Not only did Romney personally profit from the outsourcing and offshoring of American jobs, he has signed a pledge to a Washington lobbyist to protect tax breaks for companies who ship American jobs overseas. Mitt Romney also wants to encourage companies to dodge taxes by simply getting rid of taxes on foreign profits altogether. And Romney has also eagerly embraced the House Republican budget plan that also protects tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and also abolishes corporate taxes on foreign profits — many of which are “foreign” only because of accounting tricks and other gimmicks. By contrast, President Obama wants end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and instead use the money to reward companies who bring jobs back to America. The president also wants to make sure that companies pay their fair share by instituting a global minimum tax to make sure they don’t use tricks and gimmicks to dodge their taxes."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1343502831000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 15:13:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343504146000-36</Id><Topic><Title>What's with all the billy monikers</Title><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1343499095000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 14:11:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where is billie when we need him???</Msg><Username>elksmember</Username><Timestamp>1343504146000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 15:35:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343505061000-37</Id><Topic><Title>Outsourcer -in - Chief</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1343502831000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 15:13:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they should have let each one go under - kinda like GM then the taxpayers could have fixed all those floundering companies.</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1343505061000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 15:51:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343506965000-38</Id><Title>GOP assault on MEDICARE</Title><Msg>Confirmed by one of their own: Second Republican Campaigns Against Republican Budget: ‘It Harms The Medicare Program Seniors Rely On’ By Travis Waldron on Jun 22, 2012 at 9:31 am In an effort to paint himself as an independent who doesn’t always toe the party line, Montana Rep. Denny Rehberg (R) is touting his opposition to the House Republican budget in an ad released by the Montana Republican party. Rehberg, who is running to unseat Sen. Jon Tester (D), voted against the GOP’s budget plan for the second consecutive year because of its draconian cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. The ad mentions multiple votes on which Rehberg bucked his party before adding that he “refused to support a Republican budget plan that could harm the Medicare programs so many of Montana’s seniors rely on”: Watch it: Rehberg was one of 10 Republicans to vote against the budget in 2012; he was one of four to oppose it in 2011. Rep. David McKinley (R-WV), who also opposed the budget this year, has circulated campaign flyers explaining that he voted against the budget “because of the plan’s negative impact on northern West Virginia seniors.”</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1343506965000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-07-28 16:22:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343516870000-39</Id><Title>The inconvienent troof x 10</Title><Msg>Brak's got votes to buy, so leave him alone for now.
