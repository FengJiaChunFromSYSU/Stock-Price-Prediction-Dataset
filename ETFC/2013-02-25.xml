For those that want to sit about on their fat rears and get paid for it, well, anyplace with government jobs will do. If you're one of those sort do NOT apply for a job at a private Texas firm or they'll put you out on your rear before the end of your probationary period. For those with hustle and that can produce results . . . well . . . I went from systems designer (using canned software like Oracle and Excel) at MIT, to Senior Programmer at an Internet startup, to CTO of another one, in about 8 years. The last two positions being here in the DFW region. If the MS hadn't put a stop to my career I'd probably be running a highly profitable company of my own by now, instead of what's left of PBTH, which is basically a hobby research center for computer science with all of 3 contributors. Came up with a radical new design for a VERY fast computer that's essentially HIGHLY secure, but it'd cost about a billion dollars to build the initial test hardware. I've built supercomputers before, but this one requires entirely new concepts in CPU/Memory design that means it can't be built with COTS components the way I built the last one.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1361821637686</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 14:47:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361825570077-6</Id><Topic><Title>another historic catholic high priest resignation</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1361816355921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:19:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, dear, how will we sleep at night?

Bernanke minimized concerns that the central bank’s easy monetary policy has spawned economically-risky asset bubbles in comments at a meeting with dealers and investors this month, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve. “There’s a lot of disagreement about what role monetary policy plays in creating asset bubbles,” Bernanke said on Jan. 14 at the University of Michigan’s The people, who asked not to be identified because the talks were private, said Bernanke made the remarks at a meeting in early February with the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee. Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith declined to comment. The Fed chairman brushed off the risks of asset bubbles in response to a presentation on the subject from the group, one person said. Among the concerns raised, according to this person, were rising farmland prices and the growth of mortgage real estate investment trusts. Falling yields on speculative- grade bonds also were mentioned as a potential concern, two people said.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1361836062509</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 18:47:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361844388478-15</Id><Topic><Title>another historic catholic high priest resignation</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1361816355921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-25 13:19:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iiz...........right on, he didn't ADD one, this was his plan all along with more marxist #$%$ to come!
