The short interest has grown as the stock price has gone up. Therefore, the shorts entered sales lower and thus a cover would mean taking a loss at a higher price. I do see a pattern however, before each secondary is announced, the price of the stock has gone much higher and then gets gutted as the secondary is announced. That would tell me that shorts are covering into the secondary announcement to drive the price up so LLF will get a better price on his offering. That could well mean, LLF takes a short position lower and then covers to drive the price higher and then sell secondaries to bag holders at a price higher than he would get in a "normal" market.

Reid suggested that Romney’s decision to withhold tax information would bar him from ever earning Senate confirmation to a Cabinet post. Then, Reid recalled a phone call his office received about a month ago from “a person who had invested with Bain Capital,” according to The Huffington Post. Reid said the person told him: “Harry, he didn’t pay any taxes for 10 years.” “He didn’t pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that’s true? Well, I’m not certain,” Reid told HuffPo. “But obviously he can’t release those tax returns.

Tax filing was and is between individual and IRS. Tax form public disclosure is voluntary act of an individual. It isn't prerequisite for presidential campaign run. Yes, Mitt has something to hide. Like exactly to whom he donated his money, investment details, in which financial institutions he held his funds. All of which are in compliance with tax laws. If he decided not to disclose more forms, that means he gave that to public discretion. He didn't want to open any more lingerie to the media to salivate on. He loses campaign because of that? So be it. But there was nothing improper from law standpoint. Reid's claim is something else. Romney not paying "any taxes for 10 years" is accusation in illegality. He criminalized presidential candidate with 0 arguments to support the claim. A public official making criminal allegations against another individual must be qualified as felony. George Zimmerman filed the lawsuit against NBC for doctoring voice recording which made him look like a racist. Rightly so. But Mitt decided to forget it. It isn't about Mitt. It is about Harry Reid who is a felon with demented look remaining in power. Congrats. He is one of the leaders of your party.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1365651809293</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 23:43:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365652708490-33</Id><Topic><Title>Senators were told Iraqi weapons could hit U.S.</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1365515355567</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:49:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Listen, he knew when he ran that most presidential candidates make their forms public. many have all the same concerns as he did, but STILL make them public. He thought he was special, and the american people thought otherwise. There is a very REAL chance that Romney was given amnesty by the IRS, and that WOULD have made him a felon before the 'pardon'. If true then Reid was correct. Bottom line, he would need to PROVE to a court that Reid was wrong, but maybe he couldn't, and THAT is why their is no trial.</Msg><Username>sec_fordummies</Username><Timestamp>1365652708490</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 23:58:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
