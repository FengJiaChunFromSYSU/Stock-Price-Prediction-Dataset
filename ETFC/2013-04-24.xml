The media was already making all kinds of predictions before perpetrators were identified. After wishful white supremacist theory was proven to be 100% wrong, they still refused to report it properly. Calling Chechen a Russian is same as calling Palestinian an Israeli. It would be an embarrassing mistake, except it wasn't. It took less than a day after Tuscon shooting for your media to blame it on Sarah Palin's crosshair maps. Or Time Square bomber blamed on someone unhappy with healthcare bill. You circle the wagons around your media, which just can't restrain itself from its bias. While doing that wouldn't hurt to come up with some probable scenarios. As far as media goes, - it is darn predictable.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1366778745430</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 00:45:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366786212700-5</Id><Topic><Title>Blast in West, Texas</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1366739468541</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:51:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1.

In Stockton, the police budget cuts got so bad that the police union put up a billboard at one point with the following message: “Welcome to the 2nd most dangerous city in California. Stop laying off cops.” 32. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, approximately 100,000 more people moved out of the state of California in 2011 than moved into it. 33.

But in your world, if they gave it to us 50% correct we should clap our hands. Good grief, 50% is half truth, and in old time it was translated as lie. "This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while". This was one occasion when Bush used this word, just few days after horror of 9/11. And it was done when Afghanistan wasn't even in the picture. If you notice "crusade" and "war on terrorism" were used as synonyms. Now, if you poke the history, which you liberals are very reluctant to learn from, you will learn that crusaders were mere response ("jihad" in reverse) to bloody, cruel conquer of Europe by sword of Mohammad's army. So, you somehow link once used word to Afghanistan, although it was meant to be for a long time struggle, which we are still facing. Now, if there war in Afghanistan was a crusade, and our troops were crusaders in Bush era, why did Obama escalate it? Why is he still messing up with Islamic world by helping to remove Qaddafi? Did Bush force him? And what was 9/11 if not an act of jihad? What did Bush do in his first 6 months in power to anger Osama so much, that he decided to slaughter thousands and threatened to kill hundreds thousands if not millions?

Shooting an abortion doctor privately (murder) and bombing his clinic (terrorism). The first affects only the bad actor, the second affects otherwise innocent people who may be in the area. So, from the standpoint of any typical Christian obviously the murder route would be preferable to the bombing route both because of the limited damage, the removal of the most important target, and the avoidance of loss of innocent life. So why do they use bombs and still call themselves Christians? Because the ones that use bombs aren't primarily Christians, they're primarily Terrorists without even alittle bit of Christian about them. The ones who shoot individual doctors with clean hits without anyone else put at risk are still murderers, but at least they can make some claim to being Christian murder's. In the entire history of people shooting or bombing abortion providers I've only ever seen ONE case where it MIGHT have been considered justifiable, and that only because that physician was going well over the lines of acceptable practices into outright homicide himself.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1366835552602</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 16:32:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366842940128-33</Id><Topic><Title>Chechen Islamist brothers were the Boston bombers</Title><Username>croxcost</Username><Timestamp>1366374616708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 08:30:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"nobody CHOOSES to be unfortunate"... #$%$...</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1366842940128</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 18:35:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366843300723-34</Id><Topic><Title>Chechen Islamist brothers were the Boston bombers</Title><Username>croxcost</Username><Timestamp>1366374616708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 08:30:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The word was ...

I only appeal to my understanding of humanity. Didn't claim for its universal acceptance. But it is very largely accepted in Judaism, Christianity and in some part of secular world. So, it is humane to help the poor, disabled and it's already reflected in this society. But protecting the life of unborn?

One of the officials says the CIA was contacted by Russia in the fall of 2011. Officials say Russia contacted the FBI in early 2011. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing investigation. The FBI said its investigators found nothing to suggest Tsarnaev was part of an extremist group and shared that information back. Tsarnaev died in a police shootout.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1366846707694</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 19:38:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366850760267-37</Id><Title>Huge Backlash Against Republicans !</Title><Msg>It's just the beginning.
