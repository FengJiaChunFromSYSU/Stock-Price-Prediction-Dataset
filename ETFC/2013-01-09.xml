It is all about give me this or that. No one wants to lose a thing they receive for granted. Gerard Depardieu showed he has legs.But for most americans who honestly tried to provide for themselves this option is not available, while living your dream became just out of fashion. Obama takes it further and further away .</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1357707736588</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 00:02:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357708140602-2</Id><Title>Hey slayer ...tee hehehe....</Title><Msg>how do y'all like paying 39.5% tee hehehehe....

Most of those Zuckerbergs, Warren Buffets and Bill Gates are total hypocrites. Pouring money on welware for PR, but when it comes to real life they behave like jerks. It really wouldn't matter if their opinions wouldn't be used to promote political agendas. So best way is to stick those capitalist noses in somethinig they know and do best. Than keep them away from affecting our lives outside of their area of expertise. There is no capitalist who takes money away from me. They can't. Government can and does.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1357712525268</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 01:22:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357747892185-4</Id><Topic><Title>Hey slayer ...tee hehehe....</Title><Username>legofthebear</Username><Timestamp>1357708140602</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 00:09:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You spend your whole 2008 Bush tax rebate check meant for America's poor already?
