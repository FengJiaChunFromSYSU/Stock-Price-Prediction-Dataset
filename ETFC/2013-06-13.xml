Gay people are "fa**ots, Mexicans are the #$%$ of the Earth and Black people should be killed. Welcome to Arizona. Arizona Senator’s Son Used Homophobic, Anti-Semitic Language On Twitter Sen. Jeff Flake’s high school–aged son Tanner used Twitter to threaten the #$%$” who stole his bike that he “will find you, and … will beat the #$%$ out of you,” joked about an acquaintance stealing one-liners because he’s Jewish, and went by the name “n1ggerkiller” in an online game. “I’m very disappointed in my teenage son’s words, and I sincerely apologize for the insensitivity. This language is unacceptable, anywhere. Needless to say, I’ve already spoken with him about this, he has apologized, and I apologize as well,” Sen. Flake said in a statement to BuzzFeed. Although Tanner has since locked his Twitter account, a series of tweets from January and February show the Arizona Republican’s son repeatedly using the slurs. Additionally, Flake posted screenshots of scores from games on “Fun Run,” a social gaming app. The screenshots show that Flake goes by the name of “n1ggerkiller.” There is more at the link but I can paraphrase...he calls Mexicans "#$%$ of the Earth" and it appears that in the Flake household the words #$%$" and "Fa**ot" get used a lot. Let's help get this story in the news, DU. It seems like MSNBC is taking all their news from DU's Greatest Page lately. I think it is simply a case of the nut not falling far from the tree. The nut just hasn't been taught you can't say those things in public... just to your friends and the people buying your father's senate seat for him.

They have my connecting IP (unless I use a relay, and most relay IP's are known and sometimes screened) and that effectively give's them my address, so I don't even bother trying at all. On the other hand some people live in a way that could be damaging to their career or their life if their identity and/or location were to be discovered, so you can't argue there's NO privacy. For those people firewalls, anonymous relays, VPN's, and every other way of masking their traffic might be needed. Remember though, that no matter how paranoid you are, the system administrator can see everything that passes through his ports and if desired record every byte going in each direction. Do that often enough and even relays won't help unless you change relays often or use a chain of them.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1371148466214</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 14:34:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371149681535-15</Id><Topic><Title>terd</Title><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1371145623518</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 13:47:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dow down 100 the turd loses 35 cents.
