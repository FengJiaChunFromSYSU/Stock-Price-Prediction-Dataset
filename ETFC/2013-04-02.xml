The government unions are in the process of killing the goose that laid the golden egg. Stockton won't have Obama to step in and save the union thugs like he did for GM. The judge has no other avenue but to give the pension a hair cut, if he is to save the muni bond holders. If he rules against them no one will buy these bonds the cities need to finance their projects, or the borrowing rates will go through the roof. This madness needs to end now! Judge rules Stockton, Calif., to enter bankruptcy ACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — The people of Stockton will feel financial fallout for years after a federal judge ruled Monday to let the city become the most populous in the nation to enter bankruptcy. But the case is also being watched closely because it could answer the significant question of who gets paid first by financially strapped cities — retirement funds or creditors. "I don't know whether spiked pensions can be reeled back in," U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Klein said while making the ruling. "There are very complex and difficult questions of law that I can see out there on the horizon." The potential constitutional question in the Stockton case is whether federal bankruptcy law trumps a California law that says money owed to the state pension fund must be paid.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1364927415517</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 14:30:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364931163242-20</Id><Topic><Title>Not so golden any more, biggest city bankruptcy in history</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1364927415517</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 14:30:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We know you hate California.

Over the past 50 years, as tax rates have declined, there has been no increase in investment spending as a percentage of GDP. (The flat trend line shows that changes in the highest marginal income-tax rate have not affected investment much, one way or the other.) Instead, the investment share of the economy has been determined by other factors, such as aggregate demand, rather than tax policy Lower Taxes, Slower GDP Growth: Despite lower and declining tax rates, especially on the rich, the United States has had slower productivity growth over the last several decades than other advanced economies. Overall, lower taxes are associated with slower growth in GDP per hour worked. A 10 percentage point increase in taxes as a share of GDP is associated with an increase in the productivity growth rate of 0.2 percentage points. (See Figure 5.)

Bidder, this child has: 1. NO class! 2. No opinion of IT'S own, IT has to copy everything, just so if IT is wrong, as usual, so IT can say, that's what they published! 3.IT is the same Obimbocrat, left wing, liberal mouth piece like folksnews........, the clown1111....., anotherwing.......,etc. which by now one would think would hang it up - looking at the "thumbs DOWN/up" on this board of their "Creative Writing"! 4.I would highly recommend to them to with stick with the Huffington Post, Pierce Morgen, Soros, and other garbage sources! Michael Moore, Tiger Woods, Maher, Letterman are also very good and of course POOR Americans to listen too - Obimbo does!
