I figured out why Romney &amp; Rove aren't spending da ca$h. This is a Bear Exclusive. If any of Yinz parot my WAG, then Yinz need to give credit to Da Bear, E-Tub's resident genius. Okay, here goes. Y'all ready for this, huh? Romney knew his campaign was lost in early July. He couldn't move his positive poll numbers, and was sliding since we won da Pub primary. He decided to hedge his effort and went for da ca$h by naming Paul Ryan as his running mate. This brought in 10s of millions of bucks from rich Pub donors. Romney currently is sitting on almost $200 million, which he is mostly hoarding. Next, Carl "Da Greedy" Rove operates da 2nd hugest Pub Super Pack, with over $100 million in da bank and still climbing. He pulled his ads from all but a couple or three key swing states, Ohio, Florida and Iowa. He tyoo is hoarding da mother loade. Why get thrifty in da heat of da battle, huh? Anybuddy? Okay, I'll tell yaz. Romney: Once Mitt decides to hang it up, he can choose to do one or two things, hand over da campaign ca$h to Da Pub National Committee, or, give it to charity. Guess who Romney's favorite charity is, huh? Ans: Da friggin Morman Church., Mitt tides 15% every year. Okay, now Rove: Carl run sa Huge $100 million + Pub super pack. There is no congressional oversight on super packs like Romney &amp; Obama. They, Carl &amp; Buds, can party down on all da remaining ca$h after da election. Oh, btw, an attempt to provide congressional oversight on super pack money died in congress, killed by both senior Pus &amp; Libs. Romney never was a hard right type of Dude. His entire life he was pro choice, pro gay marriage, pro socialized health care, pro gun control and liberal on taxes. Now, he can take da money and run since he sees da Pub race as a lost cause. Carl is following da leader Mitt. He's slowing down da ca$h bleed and can also walk away with more money that he ever made his entire life.

In the last week that Congress is in session before the November elections, none of the Senate Republican leaders took questions from reporters at their weekly press availability -- something rarely, if ever, seen. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) left after giving brief remarks, and the remaining four leaders spoke briefly about unrelated matters and then walked away. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told The Huffington Post it was “pretty obvious” why the GOP leaders bolted: because they don’t want to talk about a newly released video that shows Romney describing 47 percent of Americans as Obama supporters who are dependent on the government and see themselves as victims. Romney has been on the defensive over the remarks, which he made during a private event in May that was secretly taped and made public this week. "Everybody is running away from Romney,” Reid said. “That's why Republicans all over the country are running away from Romney as fast as they can." He made that point to reporters earlier Wednesday. "We have a long line of people who are running from Romney as if the Olympics are still on," Reid told reporters. He ticked off the names of GOP politicians -- Sen. Scott Brown (Mass.), New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez and Connecticut Senate nominee Linda McMahon -- who have publicly distanced themselves from Romney over the matter. Martinez is "running really fast," Reid said, and Brown is "sprinting out there." Reporters were left to track down individual Republicans to get their reactions to Romney. Most insisted the former Massachusetts governor's assertions didn't entirely reflect their own views. Yet many stood by his broader point that too many Americans are getting help from the government. Reporters surrounded Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, shortly after the leaders decamped from the microphones and asked if the Romney video came up during their weekly lunch. "I just don't think we ought to talk about what was said at lunch," Blunt said, laughing weakly when asked if senators had to leave their smartphones -- i.e. video cameras -- outside of the lunch. He did say, though, that he didn't think it was "a great concern" to GOP senators that Romney dismissed 47 percent of America. In fact, he said Romney should probably keep talking about the fact that too many people are reliant on the government. "It could have been better said," Blunt said. "Trying to get more people into the active economy should be the fundamental debate of this election. I'm not sure it's not good for Gov. Romney to go right ahead and pursue that discussion." The second-ranking Republican in the Senate, Jon Kyl of Arizona, echoed Blunt, and suggested Romney try harder not to write off entire portions of the population as potential supporters. "I think if he were to recharacterize what he thinks about the vote he's going to get, he would appreciate that a lot of the folks that are currently receiving some benefit from the government are very likely to vote for him," said Kyl, noting that those include people on Social Security and getting Medicare benefits, as well as people who are in dire economic straits. Others thought Romney needed to be more inclusive, as well. "From my standpoint, we start out with the fact that conservatives, Republicans, are concerned about every American," said Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). "We want to make sure this is a land of unlimited opportunity where every person can build a good life." Yet he said he agrees with the broader substance of Romney's remarks. "What Gov. Romney is talking about is just the very unfortunate reality that there are far too many Americans that have become addicted and dependent on government," Johnson said. "The basic point is correct. It's what this election is about. Do we want a government-centered society ... or do we want to start working toward a path of opportunity and success?" At least two senators in tight races were far more adamant in slamming Romney. Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and Brown both stood by statements distancing themselves from the party standard-bearer. "It's not how I think. I think that people who are in those situations are not there by choice," Brown said. "I'm going after every person's vote, regardless of their economic station in life, regardless of their political party." "I have a very different view of the world. I believe that the federal government has certain responsibilities," Heller said. "I also believe in a safety net for individuals that need the help. So that's why I would respectfully disagree with the comments that he made." Most Republicans argued that the videos were a non-issue that won't affect the race, although Kyl allowed the that top of the ticket could sway contests in Ohio, Virginia and other swing states. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) predicted the economy would matter more than Romney's callous-sounding comments, but said Romney has yet to make a sale. "I think people are ready to fire Obama, but they're not yet ready to hire Romney," Graham said. "And they're not going to hire Romney until he tells them here's what I'm going to do."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348152002005</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:40:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348153827307-11</Id><Topic><Title>Profit by examinging these guys right now.</Title><Username>brianwix12</Username><Timestamp>1348153109275</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 10:58:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>She are on a unstoppable roll right at this moment.

Posted: 09/20/2012 10:49 am Last year I released a report documenting 60 claims that anti-gay voices made about problems that would result if DADT were to end. The report was designed as a "provisional framework" for evaluating the policy change, and as an invitation to these conservatives, who generally profess to care deeply about taking responsibility for one's actions, to hold themselves accountable for their predictions when facts ultimately emerged about the reality -- instead of the fantasy -- of openly gay service. I announced that, this year, I would co-author a major study to #$%$ the outcome of the policy change, a study that could be used to measure the validity of these anti-gay predictions. That study, co-authored by faculty from West Point, the Air Force Academy, the Naval Academy, and the Marine Corps War College, was released last week. It found that repeal "has had no negative impact on overall military readiness or its component parts: unit cohesion, recruitment, retention, assaults, harassment or morale." Today, on the one-year anniversary of repeal, it is crucial to look back at who said what about DADT repeal, and how it stacks up against empirical reality. After all, if prominent voices can impugn the lives and contributions of LGBT servicemembers without accountability, it creates a safe space for anti-gay voices to continue to abuse research to oppose same-sex marriage, LGBT parenting, and other forms of equality, including the unfinished work in the military of achieving equality for same-sex couples and transgender troops. I've called these predictions of doom and gloom in the military "anti-gay." Am I being sloppy or needlessly harsh? Couldn't people have made good-faith predictions about the impact of openly gay service without necessarily being anti-gay? They could have. And in my study of this issue over the years, I've certainly known some. But research shows that people with emotional biases against a group are prone to exaggerate the threats posed by that group. We now know that's just what's happening here. At a certain point, which I'd say we reached on DADT five to 10 years ago, enough data points emerge, a tipping point that's not just trend-based but information-based, that it becomes impossible to deny the obvious -- if you're being rational. The longstanding pattern of claiming that LGBT equality will disrupt our major institutions and even weaken our civilization is what I've called the "great disruption theory." It's the argument people used for decades to oppose equal treatment for black, female, and LGBT Americans, both in and out of uniform. And it's still being used to block gay people from access to marriage, to maintain restrictions on transgender military service, and to oppose equal treatment for a whole host of others, including, most notably, immigrants. That's why it's critical to pause, as we celebrate the progress of this milestone, to also absorb the historical lesson provided by the empirical finding that equality for gay people doesn't wreak havoc on our country. Opponents of equality will always claim it disrupts society, but the claim is a ruse meant to maintain a social hierarchy with no rational justification. True courage -- the kind shown by our troops on the front lines -- now requires the naysayers to acknowledge their wayward path, and for those who continue to falsely insist that equality is harmful to society (rather than just a threat to their own status) to cease and desist. Where are their voices now? To compare the predictions of harm against the reality found in our study, see my initial report here and the recent study here. Below is a brief summary of both the most dire predictions and the recent findings. Predictions of Harm (Excerpts): "[Lifting the ban] may even prove decisive to the viability of the all-volunteer force. That viability may, in turn, determine our ability to avoid in the years ahead -- as we have for the past four decades -- a return to conscription to meet our requirements for warriors in those conflicts" (Frank Gaffney, Jr., Center for Security Policy, 2011). "I hope that when we pass this legislation that we will understand that we are doing great damage, and we could possibly and probably -- as the commandant of the Marine Corps said and I've been told by literally thousands of members of the military -- harm the battle effectiveness, which is so vital to the support, to the survival of our young men and women in the military" (Sen. John McCain, 2010). "[Surveys suggest that if the ban is lifted, a minimum of] 24,000 current members of the armed forces might be lost over and above normal discharge attrition in a one-to-three year period... Because these personnel would be completing one or more terms of service, they would, in fact, represent a hemorrhage of mature, skilled losses from the professional ranks. This is an enormous risk to the viability of our armed forces" (General Carl Mundy, former Commandant of the Marine Corps, 2010, in a letter addressing Congress). "When your life hangs on the line, you don't want anything distracting... Mistakes and inattention or distractions cost Marines' lives" (General James Amos, Commandant of the Marine Corps, 2010, discussing his reasons for opposing openly gay service). "Assimilating openly homosexual Marines into the tightly woven fabric of our combat units has strong potential for disruption at the small unit level" (General James Amos, Commandant of the Marine Corps, 2010, discussing his reasons for opposing openly gay service). "If the law is overturned and open homosexuals are welcomed into the military, the number of homosexuals in the armed forces can only increase -- leading to a corresponding increase in same-sex sexual assaults" (Peter Sprigg, Family Research Council, 2010). "We believe that imposing this burden on our men and women in uniform would undermine recruiting and retention, impact leadership at all levels, have adverse effects on the willingness of parents who lend their sons and daughters to military service, and eventually break the All-Volunteer Force" ("Flag &amp; General Officers for the Military," a statement of over 1,000 generals and admirals, conceived by Elaine Donnelly, Center for Military Readiness, 2009). Summary of Findings of "One Year Out: An Assessment of DADT Repeal's Impact on Military Readiness," September 2012: The repeal of DADT has had no overall negative impact on military readiness or its component dimensions, including cohesion, recruitment, retention, assaults, harassment, or morale. Recruitment and retention were unaffected by the repeal of DADT. Survey data show that troops were just as likely to say that they would remain in the military after repeal as they were before, and according to Pentagon figures, the military has successfully met its recruitment and retention targets in the wake of DADT repeal. There was no mass exodus of military members as a result of repeal, and there were only two verifiable resignations linked to the policy change, both military chaplains. DADT repeal has not been responsible for any new wave of violence or physical abuse among servicemembers. Although repeal produced a decline in individual morale for some servicemembers and boosted it for others, service-wide data indicate that overall, force morale did not decrease as a result of the new policy. On balance, DADT repeal has enhanced the military's ability to pursue its mission: Greater openness and honesty resulting from repeal seem to have promoted increased understanding, respect, and acceptance, and the policy change appears to have enabled some LGB service members to resolve disputes around harassment and bias in ways that were not possible prior to repeal. The findings of this study are consistent with the extensive literature on foreign militaries, which shows uniformly that readiness did not decline after foreign armed forces allowed LGB troops to serve openly.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1348165958482</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 14:32:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348168015131-20</Id><Title>Is Yahoo losing the Spam war?</Title><Msg>Spammers still post their links even though they aren't "live".

New York Times columnist David Brooks penned a devastating column entitled “Thurston Howell Romney,” in which he argued the GOP presidential nominee doesn’t understand America: “[Romney's] comment suggests a few things. First, it suggests that he really doesn’t know much about the country he inhabits. Who are these freeloaders? Is it the Iraq war veteran who goes to the V.A.? Is it the student getting a loan to go to college? Is it the retiree on Social Security or Medicare? “It suggests that Romney doesn’t know much about the culture of America.” Even archconservative Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol called Romney’s comments “arrogant and stupid”: “It’s worth recalling that a good chunk of the 47 percent who don’t pay income taxes are Romney supporters—especially of course seniors (who might well “believe they are entitled to heath care,” a position Romney agrees with), as well as many lower-income Americans (including men and women serving in the military) who think conservative policies are better for the country even if they’re not getting a tax cut under the Romney plan. So Romney seems to have contempt not just for the Democrats who oppose him, but for tens of millions who intend to vote for him.“ Republican candidates in competitive senate races also began to distance themselves from Romney. Even the ultrawealthy private equity CEO who hosted the fundraiser, who like Romney has shifted pension obligations onto the government and bankrupted companies while walking away with billions in profits, declined to rise to Romney’s defense. Who are the 47% of Americans Romney Attacked? They are probably not the moocher class that Romney envisioned when he made the comments. They are a diverse group and don’t pay federal income tax for a diverse set of reasons: Mostly, they are either too poor to qualify for even the lowest tax bracket (but still pay federal payroll tax, and state or local sales taxes, gas taxes, and excise taxes), or they benefit from tax credits for the working poor, the elderly, or students. Active duty military in combat zones Students Seniors – one in five of those that pay no federal income taxes are elderly. Working Americans – 61 percent have jobs and pay 15.3 percent of their income in payroll taxes Fully 83 percent of those paying no federal income taxes are either working or are elderly. As Ezra Klein noted, a good many of them appear to pay a higher share of their income in taxes than Mitt Romney himself: “Among the Americans who paid no federal income taxes in 2011, 61 percent paid payroll taxes — which means they have jobs and, when you account for both sides of the payroll tax, they paid 15.3 percent of their income in taxes, which is higher than the 13.9 percent that Romney paid.” The Atlantic points out that the 47% are more heavily concentrated in red states than blue ones: nonpayers.banner.taxfound.jpg BOTTOM LINE: We need a president of all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half of Americans – seniors, veterans,students, and working people – simply because he believes they are “entitled” “victims” who will “never” “take personal responsibility and care for their lives.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348176110259</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 17:21:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348178901958-27</Id><Topic><Title>In Obama's own words</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1348078884548</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:21:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You of cource are to lame to get the point.

In fact, it only appears to be growing. Even Romney’s own running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), criticized Romney during a television appearance last night. The controversy made the front pages of at least 41 swing state newspapers this morning. Editorial boards across the country, including the New York Times, Washington Post, Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun, Mercury News, Nashua Telegraph, Concord Monitor, Charlotte Observer, Raleigh News &amp; Observer, Cleveland Plain Dealer, Toledo Blade, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Denver Post, Boulder Daily Camera, Kansas City Star, Seattle Times, Roanoke Times, Philadelphia Daily News, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and Richmond Times-Dispatch all condemned Romney in today’s paper. And now — and even worse for Romney, his fellow Republicans are distancing themselves from him and even, in some cases, outright attacking Romney for his comments. Check out the growing list of prominent Republicans who want nothing to do with Romney’s derisive, sneering attack on nearly half of the American people. 1. Susana Martinez (R-NM) The governor of New Mexico knows her state won’t be won through a hard-right campaign strategy, which is likely why she’s disavowing Romney’s write-off of 47 percent of the county. Martinez said of Romney’s comments that “New Mexico has many people who are living at the poverty level and their votes count just as much as anyone else.” Where her policy is concerned, though, Martinez isn’t quite as compassionate to the working poor or those who need government assistance. She has cut food stamps, and insinuated Democrats believe welfare is a “way of life.” 2. Scott Brown (R-MA) Brown’s campaign for re-election with Elizabeth Warren has been one of the most closely-watched, and hotly contested, in the country. Losing any voters over the comments of his party’s standard-bearer might cost him the race. So Brown ditched Romney in a statement Tuesday, saying, “That’s not the way I view the world.” 3. Linda McMahon (R-CT) Like Romney, McMahon is extremely wealthy and has been accused of being out-of-touch. In her largely Democratic state of Connecticut, that narrative won’t get her elected, so she’s decided to chastize Romney for his 47 percent comments, saying, simply, “I disagree with Governor Romney’s insinuation that 47% of Americans believe they are victims who must depend on the government for their care.” McMahon might say she disagrees, but she’s previously said that “Forty-seven percent of the people today don’t pay any taxes.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348179868658</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:24:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348179937235-29</Id><Topic><Title>Rats abandoning the SS GOP</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348179868658</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:24:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4. Dean Heller (R-NV) Senator Heller told POLITICO that he doesn’t “view the world the same way” as Mitt Romney when it comes to the 47 percent dividing line. “Every vote in Nevada counts,” he said. “Every vote. And as a United States senator, my job is represent every one of those votes, whether they voted for me or against me.” 5. Ovide Lamontagne (R-NH) Lamontagne, the gubernatorial candidate from New Hampshire, said in response to Romney’s comments, “There’s no 47 percent in New Hampshire as far as I’m concerned.” 6. Mark Meadows (R-NC) In a statement similar to Lamontagne’s, the North Carolina Congressional candidate Mark Meadows said, “I’m concerned about all 750,000 people… I am here to represent the people of this district,” jokingly adding, “It might come as a surprise, but Mitt Romney didn’t call me before he made those comments and ask for my advice.” 7. Bill Kristol Kristol’s column about the leaked Romney video were perhaps the most damning. He titled his piece, “A Note on Romney’s Arrogant and Stupid Remarks” and went on to say that Mitt Romney “seems to have contempt not just for the Democrats who oppose him, but for tens of millions who intend to vote for him.” 8. Peggy Noonan Noonan spoke out in a blog post that offered a harsh indictment of the Romney campaign telling them to “snap out of it.” “It’s time to admit the Romney campaign is an incompetent one,” she writes, “It’s not big, it’s not brave, it’s not thoughtfully tackling great issues. It’s always been too small for the moment.” 9. David Brooks Brooks said that Romney’s comments “[suggest] that he really doesn’t know much about the country he inhabits… doesn’t know much about the culture of America,” “doesn’t know much about the political culture,” “knows nothing about ambition and motivation,” and that his interpretation of how the country works “is a country-club fantasy.” 10. Mark McKinnon McKinnon, who worked for both former Pres. George Bush and presidential candidate John McCain, expressed his disappointment with Romney in an article for The Daily BeastWednesday, writing “Well, the release of the Romney tape was a moment that certainly revealed something about him. But not what I was hoping for…. How can anyone support a candidate with this kind of a vision of the country? Isn’t a divided America under Obama what folks on the right rail against?” Evening Brief: Important Stories That You May Have Missed GOP strategists say Romney’s remarks could cost them the Senate. House Democrats believe Romney’s remarks could help them win back the House. Senate GOP leaders fled their own press conference without taking questions in order to avoid talking about Romney. The Ohio Secretary of State wants to up the ante in his war on voting. Romney economic plan redistributes wealth from everyone else to the wealthiest Americans.

Secret Ryan Tape: He describes Social Security &amp; Medicare as “collectivist” &amp; “socialistic.” -- Ryan describes Social Security and Medicare as “collectivist” and “socialistic.” It is impossible to summarize these statements without sounding like a breathless conspiracy theorist. Here’s what Ryan says. Don’t trust my bullets. Read the transcript. Don’t trust my transcript, listen to the audio on the Atlas Society site. (Just scroll to the bottom of the text about Ryan (above), and you'll see a grey icon of a speaker and an arrow. Click on the arrow and the audio will play. The grey audio player is located directly above the golden star rating.) Ryan describes Social Security and Medicare as “collectivist” and “socialistic.” Ryan’s strategic plan: privatize Social Security and Medicare in order to convert people from “collectivism” to believers in a “capitalistic individualistic” philosophy. So that there will be “more people on our team” who “won’t listen to” Democrats. Ryan’s acceptance of Pinochet’s Secretary of Social Security José Piñera’s similar program of Social Security privatization as a “moral revolution” that made Marxists into capitalists who started to read the Chilean equivalent of the Wall Street Journal. Ryan is overheard, “Yeah” “That’s right.” For Ryan “defined benefit” programs such as Social Security and Medicare are problems in themselves. This isn’t something he saves for gatherings of the Ayn Rand Society, such concerns about “dependency” are scattered throughout his Path to Prosperity—again hidden in plain sight. This transcript doesn’t so much reveal a secret, as highlight a clear theme in his policy rationale that is always present, but in more public settings subordinated to his prophecies of fiscal apocalypse. Thus, it is no surprise his budget cuts the safety net and radically reshapes Medicare first and addresses the deficit later. ...................................... In the published transcript Ryan states that like Rand, he views all political and policy questions as battle between individualism and collectivism. (2:38) In almost every fight we are involved in here, on Capitol Hill, whether it’s an amendment vote that I’ll take later on this afternoon, or a big piece of policy we’re putting through our Ways and Means Committee, it is a fight that usually comes down to one conflict: individualism vs. collectivism.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348187925612</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 20:38:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348188456713-41</Id><Topic><Title>"Secret" Lyin' Ryan tapes now in play</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348187925612</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 20:38:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nothing wrong with calling the kettle black....those who get the most out of these social programs put very little to nothing in the pot...social security was designed not to pay those who payed in...average life expectancy was 63 for men and 65 for women when it was initiated....you liberals worry too much about free money and could care less how to earn it from a decent days work....that's what's wrong with you and your odaddy.........</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1348188456713</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 20:47:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348190178662-42</Id><Topic><Title>Rats abandoning the SS GOP</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348179868658</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:24:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republicans pull 3 key staffers from Romney election effort in New Mexico Source: Associated Press ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — In the latest sign that Republicans are failing to gain traction in New Mexico, national party leaders are pulling three key staffers from their effort here to elect Mitt Romney.
