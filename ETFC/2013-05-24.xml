Rather than focusing on a single issue, its authors packed it with critical constraints on the federal government that encompass rights pertaining to speech, association, religion, and the press. It is a mouthful of freedom that justifiably deserves special attention. However, like everything in the Constitution, it is not absolute and it requires interpretation to be understood and implemented. With regard to recent events concerning Fox News, and its alleged reporter James Rosen, the question as to whether there was a violation of the First Amendment’s freedom of the press has roiled the media and spurred condemnation from across the political spectrum. However, no matter what one thinks about the propriety of a government agency examining the phone records of a purported journalist, James Rosen does not deserve to regarded as one. In the government’s affidavit supporting their request for a search warrant, a passage in the document reveals that Rosen had stepped far outside the boundaries of journalism. His activities were those of a political operative with a specific agenda that was openly hostile to the official foreign policy of the United States. And Rosen pursued that agenda with an intent to obtain classified materials that he knew was impermissible for him to possess.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369408573271</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 11:16:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369408863511-11</Id><Title>Confirmed: Liberals/Progressives/Facists are Evil, Pure Evil</Title><Msg>Wow!

There were reasons for this, of course, mainly political...Still, the question is whether this cobbled-together system will work, and there have been many conservatives rubbing their hands with glee over the prospect of failure. Whoops. We won’t really know how Obamacare works until it has been in operation for a while; but we do know that essentially the same system has been running in Massachusetts since 2006, and is doing pretty well. The question, then, is whether other states that don’t have MA’s initial advantages — especially an already low uninsurance rate and an already operating system of community rating — can make this thing work. The big fear has been of sharply rising premiums as insurers are required to cover people with preexisting conditions. And the biggest test case was always going to be California.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369422716383</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 15:11:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369422787296-23</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare Will Be A Debacle — For Republicans</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369422716383</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 15:11:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, the preliminary numbers for CA are in — and they’re looking very good, with costs coming in below expectations. At this point, it looks as if this thing is indeed going to work. And think about the political dynamics. Because the Supreme Court decided to let states opt out of the Medicaid expansion, some states — notably Texas — will have a pretty dysfunctional version of Obamacare in 2014, although even those systems will provide significant benefits to many people. Still, the whole political calculus was supposed to be that Republicans in red states could point to the horrors of Obamacare and ride them to political victory. Instead, it looks as if we’re going to see blue-state residents reaping the benefits of a functional health care system, while red-state residents are denied many of those benefits, for what looks like no better reason than mean-spirited spite — because what’s going on is, indeed, mean-spirited spite.

Biddermon's right if a significant number of people think like you do this will be a show. "Republicans" don't DO things for the reasons you've been indoctrinated into thinking. Therefore your predictions of their actions are all but worthless. If they see the administration as taking a partizan stance as regards to these investigations then they WILL request a special prosecutor, just as they would if it were a Republican President stonewalling them. The difference is that those Republicans about whom there's anything interesting to find usually resign first, a sort of party ethics policy long in place, sometimes ignored, but seldom unignored by the offender when its in force. I guess the difference is for Democrats is when they think they've exhausted their options and how much damage they're willing to do to their party on the way. I don't see a huge amount of restraint on the right when they think they've really got a bone though, and calling a special prosecutor is something that is ENTIRELY possible from the House. Even if calling it a bone and finding out all they've dug up is a stick makes them look bad, smelling a bone and not TRYING to dig it up, only to have someone else dig it up triumphantly later, well . . . that couldn't be tolerated. Call it contrasting viewpoints on the lessor of two evils. Republicans almost ALWAYS prefer the evil they know to the one they don't, regardless of what they're called, sometimes showing a regrettable lack of foresight. Other times that caution pays off well. It among other things kept us out of European arguments after the civil war, following the SAME basic foreign policies in that regard as the Democratic party had before it, until finally being pushed into WWI, costing the Republicans the White House they'd dominated since Lincoln.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369429114663</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 16:58:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369430721457-32</Id><Topic><Title>republican scandal fest gets no traction</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369427657831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 16:34:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you do go on. nobody has been prevented from making a "political speech", so you are just a liar.

Markets are markets, and DEMAND based around a certain bracket of value. At this time eTrade is traveling the low end of that bracket, but given its a viable growing ongoing business in a rebounding real estate market, that will at some point turn around and become a non-issue, making this a GREAT long term buy right now. It's at least 1/3 to 2/5 of my portfolio value. Somewhere in that area. Very minimal risk baring a depression that plunges the entire nation into poverty, in which case its STILL probably a good long term hold.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369440758804</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 20:12:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369441051683-42</Id><Topic><Title>Special Prosecutor Inevitable</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1369249062544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:57:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Working on Obamascare? They threw together an 1200 page draft document, called it a law, and left it for a comittee to work out the kinds, and you imagine that what you're actually going to get out of that process is what you asked for? The Obama administration has already shut down new applicants to the pre-existing high risk insurance program because they had underestimated the costs of the program BY A FACTOR OF TWO. That'd one promise of Obamascare blown into the wind of reality. The rest are going to pretty much fall one at a time until we have an affordable system which can run at borderline bankruptcy, and which still won't cover millions of people, and they'll call it victory.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369441051683</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 20:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369441239203-43</Id><Topic><Title>Special Prosecutor Inevitable</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1369249062544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:57:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>argh, autocorrectors didn't catch . . . . committee kinks That's inserted for comittee kinds That'd and it'll make more sense for those who can't read HORRID typo.

Were they afraid to find nothing and thus create even bigger scandal? Look. I think FBI should investigate you and you must be audited every year just to scare the heck out of your fat pans. But who cares what I think? Do we have a law in this country or not? IRS has to be subjected to the law, not to yours or Obama apparatchiks perverted thinking. Or else, the whole institution must be abolished and replaced with flat tax. Wonderful! No more tax evaders! Just write it off right from your pay check.
