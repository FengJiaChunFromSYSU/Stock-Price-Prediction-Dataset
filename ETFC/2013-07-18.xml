Prosecutors tried a bad case and didn't put in many things that might have helped, but when there really aren't any witnesses to the event, it was a hard case to make.

Trayvon was dead; that left him, legally, voiceless and out of luck. The incident blew into a national outrage because, initially, the boy’s killing was nothing at all in the eyes of the law. He was walking through a white, gated community, wearing a hoodie. Stand your ground! The police held the killer for a few hours, then let him go without charges. Right from the start, it was obvious the state had no interest in actual justice from Trayvon Martin’s point of view – any more than the state has ever evinced interest in justice or, good Lord, healing in relation to its own past. Our present legal system has evolved from legal and social structures that regarded certain categories of human beings as chattel. That immorality has never been officially disowned. It has never been fully and courageously addressed with any depth of remorse, either socially or legally. We’ve never had our moment of national atonement for slavery. We’ve never started over.

Barney Frank (D-Mass.) said Thursday that Speaker John Boehner's decision to fight a legal battle to protect the Defense of Marriage Act led to the Supreme Court decision that struck down the heart of the measure. Frank said Boehner (R-Ohio) and other House Republicans should get credit "for the most pro-gay decision ever" since the court wouldn't have overruled key provisions of the law if Boehner hadn't sought to defend it. Appearing on MSNBC's "Morning Joe," Frank noted that in both gay marriage cases under review by the high court — a challenge to DOMA and a challenge to California's Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage — the executive branch had refused to appeal lower court rulings striking the laws down. "Why was the court able to make a decision in one case and not the other?" Frank asked. "The answer was John Boehner." "We can thank John Boehner and the House Republicans for the most pro-gay decision ever." In the Prop. 8 case, the Court narrowly ruled that anti-gay marriage activists defending the law did not have standing to defend the bill in federal court. That, in effect, overturned the California ban, but left undecided the greater question of whether gay couples had a constitutional right to marriage. But, Frank noted, Boehner authorized the use of $2.3 million in taxpayer funds to defend DOMA in the Supreme Court through the House’s Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG). That enabled the hiring of Paul Clement, a highly respected attorney — and the Supreme Court to put aside questions of standing. “BLAG’s capable defense ensures that the prudential issues do not cloud the merits question," Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion. That allowed the court to rule on the merits of the DOMA case, rather than technical issues of standing, and led to the dramatic overturn of the federal law that refused to recognize state-sanctioned gay marriages.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1374161411436</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 11:30:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374161780155-17</Id><Topic><Title>Are Conservatives Really This Ignorant About Racism?</Title><Username>manceridermunce</Username><Timestamp>1374094563974</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 16:56:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Darn right.

If you come back to this MB after, there is a chance you are cured.</Msg><Username>formykidsfuture</Username><Timestamp>1374168738192</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 13:32:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374168768045-32</Id><Topic><Title>gop Sex Crusade: Cuccinelli’s says ok for state to regulate the sexual behavior ofadults</Title><Username>sauerlraut</Username><Timestamp>1374154526389</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 09:35:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you are wrong.

What's an adult? In some traditions it starts a puberty, and at others there is a proving time between then and full adulthood. We peg it at 18, and yet don't consider people TRULY adults until they are 21. In the meantime we allow gradual escalation of adult privilege to older teens. Before the Federal Government put its finger in the pie age of consent laws in the US varied between 12 and 17 with most states allowing people as young as 14 to marry with parental permission (and in fact minors CAN still marry under some circumstances with parental permission). Now the court has effectively thrown age of consent laws BACK into the area of the state rather than federal government by allowing each state to decides WHAT constitutes a marriage and who can get married. There's a few other areas that are impacted as well. Line marriages, triads, polygamy, polyandry, general group marriages of all kinds MIGHT have to soon be considered legal under federal law. Don't be terribly surprised when California starts allowing people to marry their house pets or keep their spouses as house pets, whichever.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1374177707146</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 16:01:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374177845317-46</Id><Topic><Title>gop Sex Crusade: Cuccinelli’s says ok for state to regulate the sexual behavior ofadults</Title><Username>sauerlraut</Username><Timestamp>1374154526389</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 09:35:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By the way, there's no such thing as an elected official who DOESN'T grandstand making it to that level in politics.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1374177845317</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 16:04:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374177918957-47</Id><Topic><Title>why do so many pick on poor zimmerman who was minding his own business?</Title><Username>manceridermunce</Username><Timestamp>1374153396786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 09:16:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is, literally, a dead issue, why are people still thrashing it?</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1374177918957</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 16:05:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374178688625-48</Id><Title>Prescription for prison violence?</Title><Msg>A new study published by the International Journal of Drug Policy has found that as many as 80% of inmates in Swiss prisons consume #$%$, something that prison staff is fully aware of, with most feeling that it has a positive effect on the overall prison environment. According to the study, prisoners named off a variety of benefits they received from consuming #$%$; “Participants showed similar opinions on effects of #$%$ use that were described both at individual and institutional levels: analgesic, calming, self-help to go through the prison experience, relieve stress, facilitate sleep, prevent violence, and social pacifier.” Prison staff claimed that they feel #$%$ to be a relatively safe and peaceful drug; they believe that cracking down on its consumption will lead to an increase in violence, and harder drugs. In Switzerland #$%$ consumption is less of a criminal priority than in countries like the United States, although it’s still explicitly prohibited.

Lawyers for the Republican-led House Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group announced Thursday that in light of the June 26 Supreme Court ruling in Windsor v. U.S., they are withdrawing their legal defense of DOMA, according to BuzzFeed's Chris Geidner. The announcement came as part of BLAG's latest filing in a federal case from Massachusetts that challenges the constitutionality of the military's statutory definition of spouse as "a person of the opposite sex" in Title 38 of the U.S. Code. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued Wednesday that the Supreme Court ruling on DOMA effectively decides the case in favor of their clients — a lesbian judge advocate general, Maj. Shannon McLaughlin, and her wife, Casey, — in the case brought by Servicemembers Legal Defense Network and Chadbourne &amp; Park. "The Supreme Court recently resolved the issue of DOMA Section 3’s constitutionality," wrote BLAG's attorneys, according to Geidner. "While the question of whether 38 U.S.C. § 101(3), (31) is constitutional remains open, the House has determined, in light of the Supreme Court’s opinion in Windsor, that it no longer will defend that statute. Accordingly, the House now seeks leave to withdraw as a party defendant."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1374198786754</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 21:53:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374204310061-53</Id><Topic><Title>why do so many pick on poor zimmerman who was minding his own business?</Title><Username>manceridermunce</Username><Timestamp>1374153396786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 09:16:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you agree to Zimmer's right to stand his ground ............

But the measure is still catching on in the United States; the CDC study is the first to make estimates for all 50 states. Overall, Americans who make it to 65 have about 19 years of life ahead of them, including nearly 14 in relatively good health, the CDC estimated. But the South and parts of the Midwest clearly had lower numbers. That's not a surprise, experts said. Southern states tend to have higher rates of smoking, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and a range of other illnesses. They also have problems that affect health, like less education and more poverty After Mississippi, Kentucky, West Virginia and Alabama had the lowest numbers for both life expectancy and healthy life expectancy. States with the best numbers included Florida – a magnet for healthy retirees – as well as Connecticut and Minnesota. The estimates were made using 2007 through 2009 data from the census, death certificates and telephone surveys that asked people to describe their health. The CDC's Paula Yoon cautioned not to make too much of the differences between states. Results could have been swayed, for example, by how people in different states interpreted and answered the survey questions." The south.
