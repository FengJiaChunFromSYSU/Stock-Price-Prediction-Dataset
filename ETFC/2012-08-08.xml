Da Pubs wanna control spending and reduce da debt. Great, but, no more QE and paid for stimulus means recession, deflation, and very slow growth for years. It also means higher real interest rates, which will hurt stocks initially, especially when folks see da lower interest rate trend reversing. In addition, unemployment will be trending up again, since reduced spending, no unpaid for stimulus, and no more QE, will lower GDP. Long-term; howerver, this is better for Yinz in yer 20s - 40s, since y'all won't be saddled with a huge debt. Short-term, Bro Obama's approach works best, at least for about 6 - 12 months. All that new stimulus will send stocks to new highs, especially gold, and drive cyclical stocks to peak levels. BUT, then it all comes to an end about a year from now when all da state and local munis begin a HUGHER default than Europe.

But as his record sadly shows, Romney's family values often take a back seat to his presidential ambitions. Just last week, he cast aside his father George Romney, the man whose rags-to-riches success story Mitt uses as a proxy for his own, all in the name of keeping his mysterious tax returns secret. His wife Ann Romney, the woman Mitt says "reports to me regularly" regarding what American women care about, has been hung out to dry over issues including Planned Parenthood, abortion and the family's personal finances. And as it turns out, Mitt's betrayals hardly end there. In his interview with David Muir of ABC last week, Governor Romney trotted out a new defense of keeping his secret tax returns secret: "From time to time I've been audited as happens I think to other citizens as well and the accounting firm which prepares my taxes has done a very thorough and complete job pay taxes as legally due. I don't pay more than are legally due and frankly if I had paid more than are legally due I don't think I'd be qualified to become president. I'd think people would want me to follow the law and pay only what the tax code requires." Put another way, if you paid a penny more to Uncle Sam than you could've, you're not just a sucker; you should be disqualified from becoming President. Just like Mitt's dad, George Romney. Mitt's idol didn't merely establish a precedent by releasing 12 years of tax returns during his failed 1968 presidential campaign. As Paul Krugman recently reminded voters, the auto magnate and Michigan governor not only paid a lot to the U.S. Treasury, but probably much more than he needed to. Those returns also reveal that he paid a lot of taxes -- 36 percent of his income in 1960, 37 percent over the whole period. This was in part because, as one report at the time put it, he "seldom took advantage of loopholes to escape his tax obligations." (The contrasts between father and son hardly end there. As Rick Perlstein documented, George Romney didn't merely develop an innovative profit sharing plan for his employees at AMC and return bonuses if he thought them too high. He also believed that "rugged individualism" is "nothing but a political banner to cover up greed.")</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344436333000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:32:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344436415000-30</Id><Topic><Title>The way of Willard</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344436333000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:32:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But if Mitt Romney has turned his back on the legacy of his late father, he has similarly shown no compunction about tossing his wife Ann overboard when political circumstances dictated. Circumstances like those in 2002, when Romney was trying to run for Governor of Massachusetts. Its constitution requires gubernatorial candidates to have been Massachusetts residents for seven consecutive years. Unfortunately, Mitt had not just been running the Salt Lake City Olympics the past the past three years, but also paid discounted property taxes to Utah while claiming his $3.8 million Park City area mansion was his "primary residence." As the Deseret News reported on April 11, 2000, "Romney has declared his Deer Valley home his primary residence for tax purposes." And while Romney pointed the finger at his accountants at PriceWaterhouseCoopers for his failure to file as a Massachusetts resident in 1999 and 2000, he also blamed his wife, Ann Romney: Romney said he didn't see the property tax bills for his $3.8 million home in Park City Utah because the home was in his wife Ann's name and she paid the tax bills. (After paying amended taxes in Massachusetts and sending Utah a check for $54,000 for the discount he shouldn't have received, Romney survived a Democratic challenge before the state Ballot Law Commission. But with his week's revelations regarding his efforts to cut the property tax bill on his $12.4 million La Jolla, California beach front home, Mitt's status as a registered voter in Belmont, Massachusetts may once again be called into question.)</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344436415000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:33:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344436512000-31</Id><Topic><Title>The way of Willard</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344436333000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:32:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But that episode pales in comparison to Mitt's tortured history on reproductive rights for American women. For that, he used Ann Romney as a disposable human shield, which could be discarded as needed. While Romney now claims he wants to "end" Planned Parenthood, he didn't always feel that way. As ABC News revealed in 2007, Romney during his 1994 Senate run against Ted Kennedy attended a Planned Parenthood event. During a time when he was trying to establish his pro-choice bona fides with liberal Massachusetts voters, Mitt's wife Ann wrote a check for $150 to the organization. When presidential candidate Romney said in 2007 that he had "no recollection" of the fundraiser, then president and CEO of the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts. Nichols Gamble seemed surprised: "I can understand that he might not remember the check -- it's surprising to me that he would not remember the event. His main motivation for being there was a political motivation." Whatever Mitt Romney's motivation in 1994, in 2007 his run for the GOP presidential nomination required a different answer. As Romney explained in May 2007, what his wife did - the same woman who with her entire family converted to her husband's Mormon faith - did not reflect on him. As the New York Times reported: "Her positions are not terribly relevant for my campaign." Ann Romney went along with the new script. In a January 2008 interview in Florida, Mrs. Romney brushed off a question about the contribution, protesting "that was 14 years ago and $100. Do you really think I'd remember?"</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344436512000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:35:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344436544000-32</Id><Topic><Title>The way of Willard</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344436333000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:32:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If not, she doubtless remembered testifying to her husband's position 10 years ago that he was "effectively pro-choice." As Romney's wife Ann explained during his 2002 race for governor, Massachusetts voters need not worry about moderate Mitt protecting the right to choose: ANN ROMNEY: I think women also recognize that they want someone who is going to manage the state well. I think they may be more nervous about him on social issues. They shouldn't be, because he's going to be just fine. But the perception is that he won't be. That's an incorrect perception. MITT ROMNEY: So when asked will I preserve and protect a woman's right to choose, I make an unequivocal answer: yes. But Ann Romney wasn't the only family member Mitt deployed and later discarded in order to make his case as a reliable pro-choice leader for Massachusetts voters. As Salon's Justin Elliott documented in "The Abortion That Mitt Doesn't Talk About Anymore," it was his own family story which Romney claimed during his 1994 Senate run against Ted Kennedy informed his--and his mother's--pro-choice position. When Kennedy labeled him "Multiple Choice Mitt," during their debate, Romney responded with a tale of personal loss: "On the idea of 'multiple-choice,' I have to respond. I have my own beliefs, and those beliefs are very dear to me. One of them is that I do not impose my beliefs on other people. Many, many years ago, I had a dear, close family relative that was very close to me who passed away from an illegal abortion. It is since that time that my mother and my family have been committed to the belief that we can believe as we want, but we will not force our beliefs on others on that matter. And you will not see me wavering on that." But waver he did. American voters who missed those Massachusetts campaigns wouldn't know of the existence of Ann Keenan, the sister of Romney's brother-in-law who died at the age of 21 in 1963 after a botched, illegal abortion. Of course, as this 2007 exchange with Tim Russert showed, Mitt Romney no longer wants you to know about her, either: RUSSERT: You talked about your family relative who died from an illegal abortion, and yet President Romney is saying is saying ban all abortion. And what would be the legal consequences to people who participated in that procedure?... So back to your relative. ROMNEY: Mm-hmm. Romney went on to explain the consequences (loss of license and possible prison time for doctors, though not patients) of his new found anti-abortion views. But he never did get back to his relative. That's because the tragic story of "dear, close family relative" Anne Keenan wouldn't have been very popular with conservative Republican primary voters. Like Mitt's father, mother and wife (and even their horse Rafalca), she became political road kill on Romney's road to the White House. And that public mistreatment of his loved ones says an awful lot about the character of the man. After all, if there's anything worse than being strapped to the roof of Mitt Romney's car, it's being thrown under the bus."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344436544000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 10:35:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344436829000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Hypocrisy, thy name is Willard!!</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344383848000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 19:57:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It seems like you've never heard about IRS.

But Romney's family trusts kept some of those holdings and repeatedly bought new ones until 2010, when they were finally sold off for more than $3 million, according to a detailed review of Romney's financial records by The Associated Press. Recently disclosed tax returns for three family trust funds for Romney, his wife, Ann, and their adult children show scores of trades in companies whose business operations are inconsistent with Republican Party stances that Romney favors on Iran, China, stem cell research, abortion and other issues. Huff Post Via Political Wire My emphasis. See, it's not that he forgot. And it's not that it took a while to unwind the positions. SCORES OF TRADES means they were selling AND buying, trying to make money. And if it's a blind trust (line of defense #1), how could you possibly make that promise in 2007? Romney can set the general direction of his finances, Cooke and other tax experts said. Romney made that clear in August 2007, as he tried to quell a growing furor about his ownership of some stocks that clashed with Republican positions on Iran, China and other issues. "The trustee of the blind trust has said publicly that he will endeavor to make my investments conform to my positions, and I have confidence that he will do that well," Romney said in 2007. The lawyer heading Romney's trust, R. Bradford Malt, had said earlier in 2007 that he was trying to eliminate conflicts between Romney's holdings and his policy positions. So, Mitt, you like firing people. Are you going to fire R. Bradford Malt for this egregious failure to follow your clear instructions? Of course not. Because R. Bradford Malt is a longtime friend and personal attorney, and this trust is not even a little blind, is it? And replacing R. Bradford Malt would likely lead to the new trustee actually acting like a trustee is supposed to act.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344439622000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 11:27:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344439980000-41</Id><Topic><Title>Toxic tax returns</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344438572000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 11:09:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You want us to trust you about your taxes, Mitt?

In response, the government initiated legal challenges that resulted in complete disallowance of the losses claimed by Marriott and other corporations. In addition, the Son of Boss transaction was listed by the Internal Revenue Service as an abusive transaction, requiring specific disclosure and subject to heavy penalties. Statutory penalties were also made more stringent to deter future tax shelter activity. Finally, the government brought successful criminal prosecutions against a number of individuals involved in Son of Boss and related transactions not associated with Marriott, including principals at major law and accounting firms. In his key role as chairman of the Marriott board's audit committee, Romney approved the firm's reporting of fictional tax losses exceeding $70 million generated by its Son of Boss transaction. His endorsement of this stratagem provides insight into Romney's professional ethics and attitude toward tax compliance obligations. Like other prepackaged corporate tax shelters of that era, Marriott's Son of Boss transaction was an entirely artificial transaction, bearing no relationship to its business. Its sole purpose was to create a gigantic tax loss out of thin air without any economic risk, cost or loss -- other than the fee Marriott paid the promoter."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344455892000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 15:58:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344456006000-78</Id><Topic><Title>Toxic tax returns</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344438572000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 11:09:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"In the end he will release his taxes or even the GOP will not vote for him" Wrong.

No, those Swiss-US clients, got only a stern, scary warning instead. And ample opportunity to mend their IRS "Tax Dodging" ways. US files for disclosure of 4,500 Swiss accounts Geneva, 04 August 2012 -- deccanherald.com The out-of-court settlement required that the country's largest bank UBS AG hand over to US authorities information on accounts that are believed to belong to clients who hid their assets from the Internal Revenue Service to avoid paying taxes. Swiss confidentiality laws generally mandate that banks are not allowed to divulge client information. &lt;...&gt; The 4,450 accounts -- estimated to hold some $18 Billion -- will come on top of data of some 250 accounts that was already handed over in February, when UBS also agreed to pay a fine of $780 million. UBS has admitted its employees helped clients evade paying taxes, in some cases committing fraud. &lt;...&gt; And about ... Romney's Tax Returns? middleclasspoliticaleconomist -- July 18, 2012 &lt;...&gt; Wouldn't it be great if we knew which Swiss bank Romney's money had been hidden in? &lt;...&gt; In fact, we do know which bank held $3 million of Ann Romney's blind trust. It was UBS. How do we know? Brad Malt, the Romneys' trustee, said so. Not only that, when Romney released his 2010 tax return in January of this year, he had to amend two previously filed disclosure forms, for 2007 and 2011. In 2007, he had not specified that the UBS account was in Switzerland, not the U.S., according to ABC News (UBS has branches in the U.S.). Let's review the bidding: Ambiguous disclosure in 2007. UBS income on 2010 tax return. Retroactive revision of 2007 disclosure. IRS amnesty for undisclosed foreign accounts in 2009 powered by UBS prosecution. Refusal to release 2009 tax return. Yes, 2009 could be a big problem. &lt;...&gt; Romney Failed to Disclose Swiss Bank Account Income by Matthew Mosk and Brian Ross, abcnews.go.com -- Jan. 26, 2012 (pg 2) The discovery that Romney's vast holdings included an account in Switzerland, a country long notorious for helping the very wealthy hide their assets, came during his release of his tax return earlier this week. Malt, who oversees Romney's blind trusts, acknowledged during a conference call with reporters that he decided to shut down the Swiss account because he worried it could create a headache for Romney's campaign. "It might or might not be consistent with Governor Romney's political views," he said. "The taxes were all fully paid … it just wasn't worth it. And I closed the account." That suggests, Allison said, that the campaign had a motivation to exclude any evidence of the Swiss account from the candidate's forms. The Romney campaign called the omission an oversight. &lt;...&gt; Mitt Romney had millions in a Swiss bank account, Barack Obama campaign ad says &lt;...&gt; And about that "someone" who saw the full weight of the IRS-Banking Law ... I'm sure those Swiss-US clients feel that Justice was served (the 2nd tier of it at least), in this little-discussed case ...

But while New York Times statistician extraordinaire Nate Silver is running simulations to reveal which potential Romney running mate might help him most, conservative Republicans are increasingly pushing one--Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan--who might help him least. But whether or not Mitt Romney ultimately chooses as his #2 the man Charles Pierce calls the "zombie-eyed granny starver" is almost beside the point. That's because on the issues that matter most, Governor Romney and Budget Chairman Ryan are offering virtually the same dangerous prescription for America's future. Both Ryan and Romney would deliver a massive tax cut windfall for the rich, a multi-trillion giveaway offset only in part by gutting the social safety net each pretends to protect. Romney-Ryan ends Medicare as we know it with a "premium support" gambit that would dramatically shift health care costs to America's seniors. Their shared call for repealing the Affordable Care Act could leave up to 48 million more people without health insurance. Even as their draconian austerity budgets would increase unemployment beginning in 2013, both men would nevertheless ratchet up defense spending. And despite their mutual pledges to end many tax loopholes and deductions to fund their gilded-class giveaway, neither Paul Ryan nor Mitt Romney has the courage to say which ones. As a result, these supposed deficit hawks would actually add trillions more in red ink to the national debt. As Paul Begala summed up the Romney-Ryan program, "This is not like some crackpot theory from some long dead Russian immigrant." No, it is not. And no matter who emerges as the GOP's vice presidential pick, the Republican Party has already bought the Romney-Ryan ticket to the White House. Here, then, is an overview of the Romney-Ryan plan.

A reader emailed me a little while ago, asking me if I’d heard the rumor that Harry Reid’s source for his statement that Mitt Romney paid no taxes for ten years is none other than Jon Huntsman. Yeah, that Huntsman. The same Jon Huntsman who called Romney “dishonest” during the Republican primary campaign, and who still hasn’t endorsed Mitt Romney, fellow Republican and fellow Mormon. It makes you wonder…. Well, in any case, I had not heard it, but it makes sense. And here’s a little tidbit that could give one even more pause. http://spectator.org/blog/2012/01/10/huntsman-sr-partner-with-bain Huntsman Sr. Partner With Bain Capital Executive Romney really needs to cough up those tax returns, and may the Sky Fairy rain blessings on Harry Reid for taking pointe on this issue, and keeping on it even as Republicans &amp; a few misguided Democrats rain hellfire on him. UPDATE: On Twitter, @Fried_Kimchi pointed out that neither John McCain (who has seen Romney's past tax returns), nor Jon Huntsman, is calling Harry Reid a 'liar', nor telling him to stop making the claim that Romney paid zero taxes for 10 years.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344476064000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:34:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344476067000-123</Id><Topic><Title>Hypocrisy, thy name is Willard!!</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344383848000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 19:57:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rodent, What would you think of Newt or Michelle as Mitten's VP?</Msg><Username>oldtimer60</Username><Timestamp>1344476067000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:34:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344477170000-124</Id><Topic><Title>Hypocrisy, thy name is Willard!!</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344383848000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 19:57:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Leo W. Gerard Hey, Romney, Let Voters See What You Showed McCain John McCain and Mitt Romney share a secret. It's 23 years of Mitt's tax returns. Mitt gave them to McCain in 2008 when McCain, then the GOP presidential nominee, was vetting VP candidates. This time around, Mitt has won the GOP nomination, but now he's hiding those 23 years of returns from the American people. He handed them to McCain in exchange for a VP bid. But Mitt is denying that information to the American people when he's asking them for something more important -- the presidency. Mitt, a quarter billionaire, disclosed his federal payments to fellow one percenter McCain, who owns so many houses he couldn't count them. To America's middle class riffraff, Mitt has divulged significantly less -- a partial return for 2010 and a promise of the 2011 return when he finishes it. Ann Romney told ABC reporter Robin Roberts last week that the riffraff need far less to determine who will be their President than McCain did to pick a VP. Here's what Ann said: We have given all you people need to know and understand about our financial situation and about how we live our life. You people. That would be the uppity riffraff who dare to question the rich Romneys. Mitt has explained all this before. He'll tell voters what's good for them. And what's good for them is part of one year's return and maybe another year later. That'll do it. Here's how he put it to CNN: People always want to get more. We're putting out what's required plus more. Those are the two years that people will have, and that's all that's necessary for people to understand something about my finances. That's all that's necessary. Got it? Mitt told you. Now go home and shut up about it. Mitt might do better with middle class voters if he got down off his high-steppin' dressage horse. But if he did that, he might never get taxpayers to repay him the $77,000 he lost on that horse. That $77,000 loss, an amount larger than most Americans earn in a year, was revealed in the partial return Romney did release. No wonder he's reluctant to disclose more. Ann Romney described Mitt's refusal to give additional years this way on ABC: There are so many things that will be open again for more attack. And you just want to give more material for more attack. And that's really -- that's just the answer. The answer, Ann Romney said, is that there are so many things in those secret returns that would provoke criticism. And the quarter billionaire running for president don't countenance no criticism from riffraff. Ann's fear is validated by the revelation of foreign accounts and inexplicable retirement funds contained in the one partial return Romney released so far. It's incomplete because attachments weren't included. When a taxpayer has foreign accounts, as Romney does, the IRS requires the filer to include specific documentation about them. Romney didn't release those for his account in Switzerland.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344477170000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:52:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344479888000-125</Id><Topic><Title>Toxic tax returns</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344438572000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 11:09:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;&lt;(Thank you for at least giving me credit for my education) &gt;&gt; Wish you took a class on compassion, honesty and humility.

National Review are long-time Romney supporters; they endorsed him in 2008. Here is National Review’s editorial: The Romney campaign says he has released as many returns as candidate John Kerry did in 2004, and cites Teresa Heinz Kerry’s refusal to release any of her tax returns. Neither is an apt comparison [...] Romney may feel impatience with requirements that the political culture imposes on a presidential candidate that he feels are pointless (and inconvenient). But he’s a politician running for the highest office in the land, and his current posture is probably unsustainable. In all likelihood, he won’t be able to maintain a position that looks secretive and is a departure from campaign conventions. The only question is whether he releases more returns now, or later — after playing more defense on the issue and sustaining more hits. There will surely be a press feeding frenzy over new returns, but better to weather it in the middle of July.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344482718000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 23:25:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344482944000-127</Id><Title>Is he really electable?</Title><Msg>Mitt Romney Started Bain Capital With Money From Families Tied To Death Squads Source: Huffington Post In 1983, Bill Bain asked Mitt Romney to launch Bain Capital, a private equity offshoot of the successful consulting firm Bain &amp; Company. After some initial reluctance, Romney agreed. The new job came with a stipulation: Romney couldn't raise money from any current clients, Bain said, because if the private equity venture failed, he didn't want it taking the consulting firm down with it. When Romney struggled to raise funds from other traditional sources, he and his partners started thinking outside the box. Bain executive Harry Strachan suggested that Romney meet with a group of Central American oligarchs who were looking for new investment vehicles as turmoil engulfed their region. Romney was worried that the oligarchs might be tied to "illegal drug money, right-wing death squads, or left-wing terrorism," Strachan later told a Boston Globe reporter, as quoted in the 2012 book "The Real Romney." But, pressed for capital, Romney pushed his concerns aside and flew to Miami in mid-1984 to meet with the Salvadorans at a local bank. It was a lucrative trip. The Central Americans provided roughly $9 million -- 40 percent -- of Bain Capital's initial outside funding, the Los Angeles Times reported recently. And they became valued clients.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344482944000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 23:29:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344483029000-128</Id><Title>Watching a Masturbating Sloth: keeping track of ETFC</Title><Msg>Painfully slow.
