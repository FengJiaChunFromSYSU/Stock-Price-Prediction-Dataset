So there is nothing to concede here. SS was a subject of the debate. - I already mentioned that they debated distribution of PROJECTED federal budget surplus. Did I already say it was idiotic? The following couple of years confirmed that. I don't want to make it easy for you. So here it goes: - SS surplus is misnomer. Excess accumulation may be the case in the past, in the last decades it was well planned and in 2000 it was known SS is slowly becoming insolvent. I argue that there was no unplanned input flow into SS trust funds in the recent years ending up with SS surplus. - I argue that in the Bush years there were no funds taken out of SS. SS funds cannot be taken away at will, i.e. without special legislation, otherwise they must be reimbursed in full. - I argue that SS funds and Federal income are apples and oranges. Making the case that erasing Federal budget surplus is somehow equivalent to robbing SS is rubbish. Regarding your last quote. You “forgot” to mention that author who posted it on wiki says: “This article is written like a personal reflection or opinion essay rather than an encyclopedic description of the subject.” Good grief, you could not find any better than this!</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1363670602597</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 01:23:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363671791940-4</Id><Topic><Title>before you buy</Title><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363633753330</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 15:09:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where is the moon guy?

This is what some technician said at cnbc on basis of 80 years of market history. There is a good chance ETFC will go up. Around me, all real estate had gone up minimum 10% in last 6 months. Anything you bought for 150k is now 250k, and anything you bought for 300k is now 450k, and 650k is now 700k, and 1.5 million is now 2 million.

Bush and #$%$ Cheney From: Tomas Young I write this letter on the 10th anniversary of the Iraq War on behalf of my fellow Iraq War veterans. I write this letter on behalf of the 4,488 soldiers and Marines who died in Iraq. I write this letter on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of veterans who have been wounded and on behalf of those whose wounds, physical and psychological, have destroyed their lives. I am one of those gravely wounded. I was paralyzed in an insurgent ambush in 2004 in Sadr City. My life is coming to an end. I am living under hospice care. I write this letter on behalf of husbands and wives who have lost spouses, on behalf of children who have lost a parent, on behalf of the fathers and mothers who have lost sons and daughters and on behalf of those who care for the many thousands of my fellow veterans who have brain injuries. I write this letter on behalf of those veterans whose trauma and self-revulsion for what they have witnessed, endured and done in Iraq have led to suicide and on behalf of the active-duty soldiers and Marines who commit, on average, a suicide a day. I write this letter on behalf of the some 1 million Iraqi dead and on behalf of the countless Iraqi wounded. I write this letter on behalf of us all—the human detritus your war has left behind, those who will spend their lives in unending pain and grief. You may evade justice but in our eyes you are each guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally, of murder, including the murder of thousands of young Americans—my fellow veterans—whose future you stole.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363703150959</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 10:25:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363703287936-11</Id><Topic><Title>A Message to George W.

I write not because I think you grasp the terrible human and moral consequences of your lies, manipulation and thirst for wealth and power. I write this letter because, before my own death, I want to make it clear that I, and hundreds of thousands of my fellow veterans, along with millions of my fellow citizens, along with hundreds of millions more in Iraq and the Middle East, know fully who you are and what you have done. You may evade justice but in our eyes you are each guilty of egregious war crimes, of plunder and, finally, of murder, including the murder of thousands of young Americans—my fellow veterans—whose future you stole. Your positions of authority, your millions of dollars of personal wealth, your public relations consultants, your privilege and your power cannot mask the hollowness of your character. You sent us to fight and die in Iraq after you, Mr. Cheney, dodged the draft in Vietnam, and you, Mr. Bush, went AWOL from your National Guard unit. Your cowardice and selfishness were established decades ago. You were not willing to risk yourselves for our nation but you sent hundreds of thousands of young men and women to be sacrificed in a senseless war with no more thought than it takes to put out the garbage. I joined the Army two days after the 9/11 attacks. I joined the Army because our country had been attacked. I wanted to strike back at those who had killed some 3,000 of my fellow citizens. I did not join the Army to go to Iraq, a country that had no part in the September 2001 attacks and did not pose a threat to its neighbors, much less to the United States. I did not join the Army to “liberate” Iraqis or to shut down mythical weapons-of-mass-destruction facilities or to implant what you cynically called “democracy” in Baghdad and the Middle East. I did not join the Army to rebuild Iraq, which at the time you told us could be paid for by Iraq’s oil revenues.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363703287936</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 10:28:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363703385517-12</Id><Topic><Title>A Message to George W.

I especially did not join the Army to carry out pre-emptive war. Pre-emptive war is illegal under international law. And as a soldier in Iraq I was, I now know, abetting your idiocy and your crimes. The Iraq War is the largest strategic blunder in U.S. history. It obliterated the balance of power in the Middle East. It installed a corrupt and brutal pro-Iranian government in Baghdad, one cemented in power through the use of torture, death squads and terror. And it has left Iran as the dominant force in the region. On every level—moral, strategic, military and economic—Iraq was a failure. And it was you, Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney, who started this war. It is you who should pay the consequences. I would not be writing this letter if I had been wounded fighting in Afghanistan against those forces that carried out the attacks of 9/11. Had I been wounded there I would still be miserable because of my physical deterioration and imminent death, but I would at least have the comfort of knowing that my injuries were a consequence of my own decision to defend the country I love. I would not have to lie in my bed, my body filled with painkillers, my life ebbing away, and deal with the fact that hundreds of thousands of human beings, including children, including myself, were sacrificed by you for little more than the greed of oil companies, for your alliance with the oil sheiks in Saudi Arabia, and your insane visions of empire.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363703385517</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 10:29:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363703462589-13</Id><Topic><Title>A Message to George W.

I have, like many other disabled veterans, come to realize that our mental and physical wounds are of no interest to you, perhaps of no interest to any politician. We were used. We were betrayed. And we have been abandoned. You, Mr. Bush, make much pretense of being a Christian. But isn’t lying a sin? Isn’t murder a sin? Aren’t theft and selfish ambition sins? I am not a Christian. But I believe in the Christian ideal. I believe that what you do to the least of your brothers you finally do to yourself, to your own soul. My day of reckoning is upon me. Yours will come. I hope you will be put on trial. But mostly I hope, for your sakes, that you find the moral courage to face what you have done to me and to many, many others who deserved to live. I hope that before your time on earth ends, as mine is now ending, you will find the strength of character to stand before the American public and the world, and in particular the Iraqi people, and beg for forgiveness.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363703462589</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 10:31:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363705249528-14</Id><Topic><Title>"Scary", "Narrow-Minded", "Out of Touch "</Title><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1363622341539</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:59:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Log Cabin repubs always vote in lock step.</Msg><Username>lonelygaybillie</Username><Timestamp>1363705249528</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:00:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363706057071-15</Id><Topic><Title>LQQK= 13 Indicator ETFC Research Report =LQQK</Title><Username>marcoblynk</Username><Timestamp>1363428509515</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 06:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>niece raport</Msg><Username>didierlaso</Username><Timestamp>1363706057071</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:14:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363706323437-16</Id><Title>Adopted son of two gay dads sends video letter to Chief Justice John Roberts</Title><Msg>Daniel Leffew tells Chief Justice Roberts: Our families aren't "second-best" to any other BY KATIE MCDONOUGH After National Organization for Marriage chairman John Eastman called families with adopted children — like those of adoptive dad and U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts — the “second-best” option for children, 12-year-old Daniel Leffew decided to make a video sticking up for them both. Leffew, the adopted son of two gay dads and no stranger to YouTube thanks to his parents’ channel on gay family life, told the chief justice: “You and I both know that family goes deeper than blood.” And with an eye toward the high court’s decision on California’s Proposition 8, the 12-year-old told Roberts that, even though they don’t agree on marriage equality, Leffew knows that his family is “just as valuable and worthwhile as any other.”</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363706323437</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 11:18:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363709425884-17</Id><Title>GOP unrepentant!!</Title><Msg>Source: TPM Donald Rumsfeld, the former defense secretary under President George W.

California unemployment rate holds at 9.8%, highest in U.S. The state's jobless rate, unchanged in January for the second straight month, is tied with Rhode Island. But California is No. 2 in payroll job growth. California's jobless rate was unchanged at 9.8% in January for the second straight month, and that lack of improvement put the Golden State in a tie with Rhode Island for the worst unemployment in the U.S. On the other end of the spectrum, North Dakota had the lowest jobless rate, 3.3%, the government said Monday in releasing updated and revised employment data for all 50 states. California will release its county-by-county breakdown of jobs Friday, which economists expect will reflect the slow growth that is predicted in the state for 2013.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363721021498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 15:23:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363721270755-32</Id><Topic><Title>Poll Tracks Dramatic Rise In Support for Gay Marriage</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363652212540</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 20:16:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Junglebop's pole tracks the gay-marriage poll.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1363721270755</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 15:27:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363721651158-33</Id><Topic><Title>LQQK= 13 Indicator ETFC Research Report =LQQK</Title><Username>marcoblynk</Username><Timestamp>1363428509515</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 06:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>shocking news</Msg><Username>antoniosargaz</Username><Timestamp>1363721651158</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 15:34:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363723165962-34</Id><Topic><Title>don't be fooled</Title><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363714194132</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 13:29:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>total failure to communicate leads to losing money on ETFC....CIYIA back @ 12 loser</Msg><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1363723165962</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 15:59:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363723297470-35</Id><Title>Poor Feinstien gun ban beat down by Harry Reid</Title><Msg>Democratic controlled senate says "no" on the little jewish girls assault ban...not to worry, she will still have her personal bodyguards to protect her from the disinfranchised folks she represents. ** there were less than 40 votes for Feinstein's ban.** Assault weapons ban won't be in Dems' gun bill Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has decided that a proposed assault weapons ban won't be part of a gun control bill the Senate plans to debate next month, the sponsor of the ban said Tuesday, a decision that means the ban stands little chance of survival. Instead, Sen. Dianne Feinstein said she will be able to offer her ban on the military-style firearms as an amendment. Feinstein is all but certain to need 60 votes from the 100-member Senate to prevail, but she faces solid Republican opposition and likely defections from some moderate Democrats. "I very much regret it," Feinstein, D-Calif., told reporters of Reid's decision. "I tried my best." Asked about the decision, Reid, D-Nev., said he wanted to bring a gun bill to the full Senate that would have enough support to overcome any GOP attempts to prevent debate from even starting. He said that "using the most optimistic numbers," there were less than 40 votes for Feinstein's ban.

In fact, the taxes-versus-spending distinction is largely meaningless. Each year, the government doles out tax breaks worth $1.1 trillion. That is more than the cost of Medicare and Medicaid combined. It is more than Social Security. It tops the defense budget, and it tops the budget for nondefense discretionary programs, which include most everything else. Tax breaks work like spending. Giving a deduction for certain activities, like homeownership or retirement savings, is the same as writing a government check to subsidize those activities. Functionally, they mimic entitlements. Like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, they are available, year in and year out, in full, to all who qualify. Yet in budget talks, Republicans ignore tax entitlements, which flow mostly to high-income taxpayers, while pushing to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. President Obama and Congressional Democrats have rightly asserted that tax breaks are ripe for cuts that could raise revenue without hurting most taxpayers. One method, as presented in the Senate Democratic plan, is to convert tax deductions, which increase in value as income rises, to tax credits, which would provide benefits more broadly and evenly among low-, middle- and high-income households.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1363737516726</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 19:58:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363737585720-46</Id><Topic><Title>Welfare for the well to do</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1363737516726</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 19:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tax deductions, however, are only one kind of tax break. Many others take the form of arrangements that allow wealthy taxpayers to either escape tax entirely on specific transactions or to defer it indefinitely. Democratic budget proposals have targeted some tax shelters. They all bear scrutiny. Especially now, when solutions are needed to replace the automatic budget cuts, many tactics are indefensible and should be ended, including: CARRIED INTEREST This loophole lets private equity partners pay tax on most of their income at a top rate of 20 percent, versus a top rate of 39.6 percent for other high-income professionals. It drains the Treasury of $13.4 billion a decade, and should be closed, along with a shelter recently enacted in Puerto Rico that would help shield the income of individuals whose taxes would rise if the carried-interest tax break was eliminated. NINE-FIGURE I.R.A.’S Remember Mitt Romney’s $100 million I.R.A? Private equity partners apparently build up vast tax-deferred accounts by claiming that the equity interests transferred to such accounts from, say, their firms’ buyout targets are not worth much. No one knows how much tax is avoided this way. What is known is that I.R.A.’s are meant to help build retirement nest eggs, not to help amass huge estates to pass on to heirs.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1363737585720</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 19:59:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363737628237-47</Id><Topic><Title>Welfare for the well to do</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1363737516726</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 19:58:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>‘LIKE KIND’ EXCHANGES As reported in The Times by David Kocieniewski, this tax break was enacted some 90 years ago to help farmers sell land and horses without owing tax, as long as they used the proceeds to buy new farm assets. Today, it is used by wealthy individuals and big companies to avoid tax on the sale of art, vacation homes, rental properties, oil wells, commercial real estate and thoroughbred horses, among other transactions. Government estimates say this costs about $3 billion a year, but industry data suggest the amount could be far higher. The list goes on. American multinationals, insurance companies and so-called S corporations are tax avoidance machines. What remains of the estate tax is beset with tax dodges. Even golf courses are entitled to a special tax break of their own: some $50 million a year is granted to owners who donate golf courses to conservation trusts, ostensibly to benefit the public — though the public good in private courses is dubious. In this time of ill-advised budget cuts, there are surely better ways to spend that money. For $50 million, 6,000 children could attend Head Start next year.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1363737628237</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 20:00:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363738451874-48</Id><Title>Remember the Guy Shot 5 Times Breaking in on a Woman in Atlanta?....</Title><Msg>Well he seems as Dumb as they come...

One Subscription. Total Access. By Bryan Cronan The man shot five times by a Loganville mother of two during an alleged home invasion rejected a plea deal Tuesday and will head to trial, Channel 2 Action News reported. Paul Ali Slater, 32, pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a Jan. 4 home invasion in Walton County. Slater’s attorney Neal Ainsworth told Channel 2 they were ready to accept a plea bargain, but the prosecution team changed the terms of the deal and wanted a substantially longer sentence. “Negotiations broke down and that was changed this morning, which obviously changed what we were going to do,” he said. Even though Slater pleaded not guilty, Ainsworth said that Slater admits he broke into the home. “He has six children and acknowledged that he shouldn’t have been there. That breaking into people’s houses to steal things to support your family is inappropriate,” Ainsworth said. The AJC reported in January that Slater is accused of using a crowbar to break into the home of a woman who was working from home with her 9-year-old twins. The family hid in an attic crawl space. When Slater opened the door, the woman shot him five times in the neck and face with a .38 revolver, police said. Slater drove away from the scene but didn’t make it far. Police found him bleeding profusely in a neighbor’s driveway. He spent 30 days in the hospital and now has limited use of one arm, his attorney said. Slater will go on trial in April.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1363738451874</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 20:14:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363739262277-49</Id><Topic><Title>Proof of what happenes when liberals are in charge</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363721021498</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 15:23:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bidder, give Jerry Clown some credit, after all, when he denied fruit farmers to spray so their crops wouldn't be useless, he became "THE FREEDOM FIGHTER FOR FRUIT FLIES" and that is also true for San Francisco! ;o) ROWDY</Msg><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1363739262277</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 20:27:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363739364989-50</Id><Topic><Title>Bush's War was ALL Borrowed $$$$$$$</Title><Username>methuserlaw</Username><Timestamp>1363724370216</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 16:19:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey "Meth"...(JB)...

The Dunce His former Harvard Business School professor recalls George W. Bush not just as a terrible student but as spoiled, loutish and a pathological liar. By Mary Jacoby Salon September 16, 2004 For 25 years, Yoshi Tsurumi, one of George W. Bush’s professors at Harvard Business School, was content with his green-card status as a permanent legal resident of the United States. But Bush’s ascension to the presidency in 2001 prompted the Japanese native to secure his American citizenship. The reason: to be able to speak out with the full authority of citizenship about why he believes Bush lacks the character and intellect to lead the world’s oldest and most powerful democracy. -snip- Bush,by contrast,“was totally the opposite of Chris Cox,” Tsurumi said. “He showed pathological lying habits and was in denial when challenged on his prejudices and biases. He would even deny saying something he just said 30 seconds ago. He was famous for that. Students jumped on him; I challenged him.” When asked to explain a particular comment, said Tsurumi, Bush would respond, “Oh, I never said that.” A White House spokeswoman did not return a phone call seeking comment.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363741066395</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 20:57:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363741145225-53</Id><Topic><Title>Bush and Cheney should be jailed</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363740588019</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 20:49:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Students who challenged and embarrassed Bush in class would then become the subject of a whispering campaign by him, Tsurumi said. “In class, he couldn’t challenge them. But after class, he sometimes came up to me in the hallway and started bad-mouthing those students who had challenged him. He would complain that someone was drinking too much. It was innuendo and lies. So that’s how I knew, behind his smile and his smirk, that he was a very insecure, cunning and vengeful guy.” -snip- “I used to chat up a number of students when we were walking back to class,” Tsurumi said. “Here was Bush,wearing a Texas Guard bomber jacket, and the draft was the No. 1 topic in those days. And I said, ‘George, what did you do with the draft?’ He said, ‘Well, I got into the Texas Air National Guard.’ And I said, ‘Lucky you. I understand there is a long waiting list for it. How’d you get in?’ When he told me, he didn’t seem ashamed or embarrassed. He thought he was entitled to all kinds of privileges and special deals. He was not the only one trying to twist all their connections to avoid Vietnam.

However, since one of those 'others' was Vice President Cheney, it didn't matter what I thought. In 2002, Chalabi joined the annual summer retreat of the American Enterprise Institute near Vail, Colorado. He and Cheney spent long hours together, contemplating the possibilities of a Western-oriented Iraq: an additional source of oil, an alternative to US dependency on an unstable-looking Saudi Arabia. I'm trying to remember if this is even a revelation anymore. Certainly anyone who argued at the time that oil was one of the motivations for the Iraq War was ridiculed mercilessly, but since then it's been all but obvious, right? There was the fact that the only building American troops protected during the post-invasion rioting was the Oil Ministry. There were all those lovely maps of Iraqi oil fields that we learned had been part of #$%$ Cheney's energy task force since long before 9/11. There was the urgency over restoring Iraq's oil production that seemed to take precedence over almost everything else. Hell, no less than Alan Greenspan conceded after the fact that the war was "largely about oil." Besides, in a broader sense, even lots of war supporters acknowledged that, in general, American interest in the Middle East is driven strongly by our interest in the stability of Middle East oil supplies. That's not exactly a news flash, and if it's true in general then it must also have been at least part of the specific motivation for getting rid of Saddam Hussein. After all, until we did that, the oil sanctions against Iraq would stay in place. Still, it's good to hear this from the horse's mouth.
