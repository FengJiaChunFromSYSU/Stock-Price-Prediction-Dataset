It's nice to see Fox so clearly admit to their modus operandi -- kos) In February 2003, a Florida Court of Appeals unanimously agreed with an assertion by FOX News that there is no rule against distorting or falsifying the news in the United States. Lawyers paid by Bill O'Reilly's bosses argued in court that Fox can lie with impunity. It's their right under the 1st Ammendment FOX asserted that there are no written rules against distorting news in the media. They argued that, under the First Amendment, broadcasters have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves. December 1996, Jane Akre and her husband, Steve Wilson, were hired by FOX as a part of the Fox “Investigators” team at WTVT in Tampa Bay, Florida.to investigat bovine growth hormone (BGH), a controversial substance manufactured by Monsanto Corporation. Fox executives and their attorneys wanted the reporters to use statements from Monsanto representatives that the reporters knew were false and to make other revisions to the story that were in direct conflict with the facts. Fox editors then tried to force Akre and Wilson to continue to produce the distorted story. Akre and Wilson refused and threatened to report Fox's actions to the FCC, they were both fired. August 18, 2000, a unanimous Florida jury found that Akre was wrongfully fired by Fox Television when she refused to broadcast (in the jury's words) “a false, distorted or slanted story” The jury awarded her $425,000 in damages. FOX appealed the case, and on February 14, 2003 the Florida Second District Court of Appeals overturned the settlement awarded to Akre. In a stunningly narrow interpretation of FCC rules, the Florida Appeals court claimed that the FCC policy against falsification of the news does not rise to the level of a "law, rule, or regulation," it was simply a "policy." Therefore, it is up to the station whether or not it wants to report honestly. During their appeal, FOX asserted that there are no written rules against distorting news in the media. They argued that, under the First Amendment, broadcasters have the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on public airwaves. Fox attorneys did not dispute Akre’s claim that they pressured her to broadcast a false story, they simply maintained that it was their right to do so. Fox then filed a series of motions seeking more than $1.7 million in trial fees and costs from both Akre and Wilson.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344139360000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 00:02:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344142750000-2</Id><Topic><Title>While watching Fox news</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344139360000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 00:02:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It appears the court based their ruling on a precedent set long ago by Dan, (the Blather) Rather an ex master prevaricator at NBC the News Twisting Organization.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) leveled a serious charge against his colleague Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Sunday, accusing the Senate majority leader of lying on the Senate floor when he said he’d heard Mitt Romney didn’t pay taxes for a decade. “I’ve been around this town for a while,” Graham told Candy Crowley on CNN’s "State of the Union." “I actually like Harry. But what he did on the Senate floor is so out of bounds. I think he’s lying about it.” Reid recently told The Huffington Post in an interview that he’d heard from an early Bain Capital investor that the presumptive GOP presidential nominee didn’t pay taxes for 10 years; he then reiterated the charge on the Senate floor later in the week, prolonging a drama that consumed much of the political news cycle. “So, the word’s out that he hasn’t paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove that he has paid taxes, because he hasn’t,” Reid said on the floor. “We already know from one partial tax return that he gave us, he has money hidden in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and a Swiss banking account." The accusation, from which Reid has not backed down, infuriated the Romney campaign, putting the former Massachusetts governor in the awkward position of having to release more taxes if he wants to debunk Reid’s charges. Romney has insisted he’s paid taxes every year, although he hasn’t said just how much. “I have paid taxes every year,” Romney insisted. “A lot of taxes.” In his interview with The Huffington Post, Reid clarified that he didn’t know if it was true Romney hadn’t actually paid any taxes. "He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain," Reid said. "But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look?" "I just cant let that pass," Graham told Crowley. "I can't believe the majority leader of the United States Senate would ... make accusations that are unfounded in my view."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344180947000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 11:35:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>20</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344181164000-14</Id><Topic><Title>Harry called a liar</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344180947000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 11:35:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reince Priebus Harry Reid Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus waded into the Harry Reid-Mitt Romney tax drama on Sunday, calling the Senate majority leader a "dirty liar" for his accusation that Romney didn't pay any taxes for a decade. "As far as Harry Reid is concerned, listen, I know you might want to go down that road. I’m not going to respond to a dirty liar," Priebus told ABC's "This Week" host George Stephanopoulos. "If that’s on the agenda, I’m not going go there. This is just a made-up issue." "You're saying youre not going to go down that road?" Stephanopoulos responded. "You just called him a dirty liar. You stand by that -- you think Harry Reid is a dirty liar?" "I just said it," Priebus said. In an interview with The Huffington Post last week, Reid said he'd heard from an early Bain Capital investor that Romney didn't pay taxes for a decade. A growing chorus of politicians on both sides of the aisle have called on the former Massachusetts governor to release more of his tax returns in order to dispel the rumor, but Priebus came up short of that. "I think this president has a problem with the American dream," Priebus said. "That he would trot out Harry Reid and try to divide this country and spread this division and hatred, it's ridiculous, it's wrong, it's untrue." Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), also speaking on "This Week," declined to specifically address Reid's accusation, but she said Romney could end all the discussion by releasing his returns. "I do know that Mitt Romney could clear this up in 10 seconds by releasing the 23 years of tax returns that he gave to John McCain when he was being vetted for vice president, ” Wasserman Schultz said. “Because one year of tax returns, like he’s released, could just be for show."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344181164000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 11:39:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344181824000-15</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Does What's Natural...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344131207000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 21:46:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bawawawawawawawawa????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!========================</Msg><Username>bypartisan305</Username><Timestamp>1344181824000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 11:50:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344182326000-16</Id><Topic><Title>eight point three</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1343999832000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 09:17:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Necon pols are always false!</Msg><Username>dems_win</Username><Timestamp>1344182326000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 11:58:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344182690000-17</Id><Topic><Title>eight point three</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1343999832000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 09:17:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If romneys tax records show he paid no taxes for three years he is sunk with the 99%.

That's the signpost up ahead, your next stop, the Twilight Zone!" The obvious answer is a space alien from Connecticut. As we all know, space aliens live among us. Particularly in the 1970’s when Obama’s number was issued, space aliens were here in large numbers. Remember “The Age of Aquarius?” In order to study us, aliens had to work alongside us and for that they needed social-security numbers. While aliens could, with their advanced technology, forge any identity document they wanted, the social-security number is cross checked with government records and so a real number was needed. The 1890 birth date, of course, makes perfect sense because space aliens traveling across the galaxy at near the speed of light age much more slowly that we Earthlings, and so the alien really was born in 1890, but appeared to be just a teenager. Finally, the space alien departed and never noticed the unusual social-security-reported income activity from Barack Obama’s part-time job at Baskin Robbins in Honolulu. The only real alternatives are that the government mistakenly gave Obama a Connecticut SSN, or that Obama is a space alien himself — and we know that the government never makes a mistake.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344197203000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 16:06:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344198110000-42</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Does What's Natural...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344131207000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 21:46:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;&lt;BO's genealogy can actually be traced backed to Kings of England.

The brave men and women of our military make tremendous sacrifices to protect and defend our freedoms, and we should do everything we can to protect their fundamental right to vote. I stand with the fifteen military groups that are defending the rights of military voters, and if I’m entrusted to be the commander-in-chief, I’ll work to protect the voting rights of our military, not undermine them. This certainly sounds outrageous, but it is not true. Since 2005, Ohio has had in person early-voting in the three days prior to the election. This year, however, the Republican legislature in Ohio eliminated early voting during this period, except for members of the military. The Obama lawsuit is attempting to restore voting rights for all Ohioans, not restrict them for the military or any other group. From the Obama lawsuit, filed in federal court: Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to restore in-person early voting for all Ohioans during the three days prior to Election Day – a right exercised by an estimated 93,000 Ohioans in the last presidential election. Ohio election law, as currently enacted by the State of Ohio and administered by Defendant Ohio Secretary of State, arbitrarily eliminates early voting during the three days prior to Election Day for most Ohio voters, a right previously available to all Ohio voters. The Obama campaign’s request for a preliminary injunction does not seek to restrict military voting. Rather, it simply is asking that the full early voting period be open to all citizens, as it was under the law before this year. Even Fox News acknowledges the purpose of the suit, noting “the lawsuit does not restrict the ability of military personnel to cast their ballots early.” Update The Romney campaign is totally unable to back up their candidate’s claim: Romney’s spokesman, Ryan Williams, in an interview Saturday could point to no place in Obama’s lawsuit that seeks to restrict the rights of military voters… Romney’s legal counsel, Katie Biber, said creating two separate classes of Ohio voters does not violate the 14th Amendment, though she also did not offer evidence that Obama’s lawsuit would make it tougher for members of the military to vote…</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344208689000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 19:18:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344209232000-47</Id><Title>Wimp in trouble</Title><Msg>Sat Aug 04, 2012 at 06:00 PM PDT Another Republican says Mitt's hurting himself by not releasing his dang tax returns already by Hunter Mitt Romney flashes cash with Bain partners It's a secret.

Never mind that a majority of Americans – and a third of Republicans – think he should come clean. It’s beyond obvious that whatever’s in those returns must be enough to do serious damage to Romney, or even sink his candidacy completely. What might it be, exactly?

After all, the right-wing Daily Caller reported that in 2010 and 2011, the two years for which Romney released partial returns, it looks like the former Mormon bishop under-tithed the church, paying 7 percent of his income one year and 9.7 percent over the two-year period. As the Caller noted, “Romney recently told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace, ‘I made a commitment to my church a long, long time ago that I would give 10 percent of my income to the church, and I’ve followed through on that commitment. So, if I had given less than 10 percent, then I think people would have to look at me and say, ‘Hey, what’s wrong with you fella — don’t you follow through on your promises?’” Of course, if he were sheltering additional income in offshore accounts, then the degree to which the Caller says he shortchanged the Mormons might be even greater.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344219368000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:16:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344221281000-58</Id><Topic><Title>The reluctant Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344218863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2. Things That Might Infuriate the Base Mitt Romney, who just four years ago was dubbed the “conservative alternative” to John McCain is probably, as he claims, “severely conservative.” But when he wanted to become governor of Massachusetts, he played to that state’s politics, swearing to protect a woman’s right to choose, saying that climate change isn’t a socialist plot and generally being reasonable. He passed the precursor to Obamacare, which he now condemns as a sign of looming tyranny. Rick Newman at US News and World Report wonders whether Romney really stopped supporting those causes when he claims to have converted himself into a far-right Republican. Could he have a bunch of itemized deductions to, say, Planned Parenthood listed on those returns? We’d be wrong not to speculate.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344221281000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:48:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344221390000-59</Id><Topic><Title>The reluctant Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344218863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>3. Harry Reid, Lazy Blogger That’s how Wonkette characterized Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid’s unsourced, secondhand rumor that Mitt Romney paid no taxes at all over a 10-year period. (This is very unlikely, due to the Alternative Minimum Tax.) But many, many people have speculated that the reason Mitt doesn’t want to reveal his tax returns is that they will show that he paid a significantly lower rate than his campaign has claimed in the years prior to 2010.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344221390000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:49:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344222200000-60</Id><Topic><Title>The reluctant Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344218863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4. It’s the IRAs Mitt Romney has an Individual Retirement Account, just like you probably do! But unlike you, Mitt has somewhere between $20 million and $101 million in his account. We know that the maximum amount one can contribute to an IRA account is $17,000 per year (employers can match that with up to $30,000). So that would be a pretty impressive performance – what an investor! Or what a cheat. Michael Graetz, a professor of tax law at Columbia University and a former official in the senior Bush’s Treasury Department, suggested that to get such a fat IRA, “we have to presume that Mr. Romney valued the assets he put in his retirement account at far less than he would have sold them for.” He continues: The I.R.A. also allows Mr. Romney to diversify his large holdings tax-free, avoiding the 15 percent tax on capital gains that would otherwise apply. His financial disclosure further reveals that his I.R.A. freed him from paying currently the 35 percent income tax on hundreds of thousands of dollars of interest income each year.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344222200000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 23:03:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344223175000-61</Id><Topic><Title>The reluctant Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344218863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>5. The Mini-Mitts Graetz has a second theory about what Mitt might be hiding, and it also has to do with dramatically under-valuing his assets in order to screw over Uncle Sam. It has to do with a trust he set up for his five sons in 1995. Graetz explains that until this year, there was a $1 million life-time exemption on such gifts, and after that they should have been taxed at between 29-44 percent. So Mitt would have been on the hook for between $29 and $44 million in gift taxes. “Based on his aggressive tax planning,” writes Graetz, “my bet is that — if Mr. Romney filed a gift tax return for these transfers at all — he put a low or even zero value on the gifts, certainly a small fraction of the price at which he would have sold the transferred assets to an unrelated party.” Wouldn’t he get busted with such a brazen strategy to avoid paying taxes? After all, that’s some pretty serious tax fraud. Well, catching Mitt in this kind of scheme might be harder than one would think. Graetz explains that “every good tax professional knows that gift tax returns are rarely audited, except after the transferer’s death. And normally the I.R.S. cannot challenge such a return after three years from its filing.”</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344223175000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 23:19:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344223257000-62</Id><Topic><Title>The reluctant Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344218863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>6. Is It All About 2009? BusinessWeek‘s Joshua Green thinks Romney may not want to reveal his taxes for one year in particular – 2009. That’s because Romney probably took some significant losses when the economy crashed in 2008. Green explains: It’s possible he suffered a large enough capital loss that, carried forward and coupled with his various offshore tax havens, he wound up paying no U.S. federal taxes at all in 2009. If true, this would be politically deadly for him… The “zero tax in 2009” theory—again, this is sheer speculation—gains further sustenance when you consider it’s the only year for which nobody knows anything about Romney’s taxes. He’s revealed what’s in his 2010 and 2011 returns, and he reportedly submitted 20-some years’ worth of returns to the McCain campaign when he was being vetted for vice president in 2008. Steve Schmidt, McCain’s chief strategist in that campaign, said on MSNBC,,, that while he didn’t examine Romney’s returns himself, nothing that McCain’s vetters found in them disqualified Romney from consideration.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344223257000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 23:20:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344223472000-63</Id><Title>Sikh shooting in Wisconsin</Title><Msg>www.yahoo.com</Msg><Username>dems_win</Username><Timestamp>1344223472000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 23:24:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344223473000-64</Id><Topic><Title>The reluctant Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344218863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>7. CEO, President and Chairman of Bain You probably know that Mitt claims he retired – or perhaps retired “retroactively” – from Bain Capital in 1999. You probably also know that almost three years later, as the Huffington Post reported, “Romney was listed as the CEO, chairman and president of the company… in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission; took a six-figure salary; signed corporate documents related to major and minor deals and attended board meetings for at least two Bain-affiliated companies.” It’s possible that releasing his returns could clarify exactly what involvement he had with Bain after 1999. And that might reveal that Romney was, contrary to his claims, involved in Bain’s decision to invest in Stericycle, a medical waste company that disposed of aborted fetuses. Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman, told Fox News: “If he released more documents, like further tax returns, we would know the extent of his involvement at Bain during this period.”</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344223473000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 23:24:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344223536000-65</Id><Topic><Title>The reluctant Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344218863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>8. Is Mitt a Felon? Relatedly, in 2011, Mitt Romney signed a financial disclosure form and sent it to the Federal Election Commission.

It’s a felony to lie on an FEC financial disclosure form. Some forms of tax evasion are also felonies.

There’s Nothing – It’s Just His Sense of Entitlement Esquire’s James Wolcott doesn’t think there’s any there there. Sure, Romney’s tax returns would provide an object lesson in how the ultra-rich avoid paying their fair share of taxes, but everyone already knows that those at the top of the pile game the system. For Wolcott, the issue comes down to Romney refusing to bow to the little people on principle. It is helpful always to remind yourself that, in the mind of Willard Romney, there are only two kinds of people — himself and his family, and the Help. Throughout his career, and especially throughout his brief political career, Romney has treated the Help with a kind of lordly disdain… The Help has no right to go pawing through the family books, giggling at the obvious loopholes and tax dodges, running amok through all the tax shelters, and probably getting their chocolate-y fingerprints all over the pages of the Romney family ledger. And, certainly, those members of the Help in the employ of the president of the United States, who is also part of the Help, have no right to use the nearly comically ostentatious wealth of the Romney as some sort of scrimey political weapon. He does not have to answer to the Help. I mean, jeepers, he’s running for office. This isn’t stubbornness. That’s often an acquired trait. What this is, fundamentally, is contempt. Contempt for the process, and contempt for the people who make their living in that process, and contempt for the people whose lives depend on that process. There are rules for the Help with which Willard Romney never has had to abide, and he has no intention of starting now. My dear young fellow, this simply is not done.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344224104000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 23:35:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344224155000-70</Id><Topic><Title>The reluctant Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344218863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Most Likely Explanation Given Romney’s refusal to release his returns, this kind of speculation is entirely predictable. But the most likely reason Romney doesn’t want to release his returns is that they’ll cast a bright light on the aggressive tax avoidance strategies the super-rich use every day – strategies David Cay Johnston outlined so well in his excellent book, Perfectly Legal. The Romney campaign keeps assuring us that he paid all taxes required by law, and that very well might be the problem. A Vanity Fair investigation into the trickle of tax documents that Romney has disclosed – under intense pressure – found that they “provided a lavish smorgasbord for Romney’s critics. Particularly jarring were the Romneys’ many offshore accounts.” To give but one example, there is a Bermuda-based entity called Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors Ltd., which has been described in securities filings as “a Bermuda corporation wholly owned by W. Mitt Romney.” It could be that Sankaty is an old vehicle with little importance, but Romney appears to have treated it rather carefully. He set it up in 1997, then transferred it to his wife’s newly created blind trust on January 1, 2003, the day before he was inaugurated as Massachusetts’s governor. The director and president of this entity is R. Bradford Malt, the trustee of the blind trust and Romney’s personal lawyer. Romney failed to list this entity on several financial disclosures, even though such a closely held entity would not qualify as an “excepted investment fund” that would not need to be on his disclosure forms. He finally included it on his 2010 tax return. Even after examining that return, we have no idea what is in this company, but it could be valuable, meaning that it is possible Romney’s wealth is even greater than previous estimates. While the Romneys’ spokespeople insist that the couple has paid all the taxes required by law, investments in tax havens such as Bermuda raise many questions, because they are in “jurisdictions where there is virtually no tax and virtually no compliance,” as one Miami-based offshore lawyer put it. While James Wolcott thinks that it’s “hardly a secret anymore” that “our tax code — and, indeed, our entire economic system — has been gamed to benefit the folks in Romney’s economic stratum,” most people probably don’t have a firm grasp on precisely how the vaunted “job creators” avoid paying their fair share, and the release of Romney’s returns would offer a teachable moment. As real estate billionaire Leona Helmsley once said, “Only the little people pay taxes.” That’s not the message Mitt Romney wants to convey during a campaign that has a lot to do with tax cuts for the wealthiest.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344224155000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 23:35:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
