But lets look at the dissenting opinion for that court, the right to keep and bear arms" protects only a right to possess and use firearms in connection with service in a state-organized militia" Really?, the founders felt they had to protect the rights of people in a state run military militia to bear arms, that's your argument?

"Comprehensive health care" is already in the books. And it is silent about the issue. Obama owns it 100%. Videos are protected by 1st amendment, but president wouldn't lift a finger to wag on his Hollywood friends. Barrasso only points out that president's executive orders are off target. Not to mention that executive orders designed to be addressed to executive branch only. So, our dear leader oversteps constitutional boundaries. by imposing them on regular citizens. Never mind, no one outside executive branch violates the law by disobeying executive order.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1358895330709</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 17:55:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358899382096-5</Id><Topic><Title>My friends and I are uneducated liberal hicks</Title><Username>ufcw_shill</Username><Timestamp>1358822263559</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 21:37:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not to worry, you libs have 4 more years of handouts.

The cheapest, the Raven, is about $70. As far as revolvers go, about the cheapest made today are over $200 anyway, you see making revolvers that actually work is HARDER than making a cheap blow back operated semi-automatic, a device I could create from scrap material in a workshop at almost any High School.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358904160739</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 20:22:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358905329974-9</Id><Topic><Title>The Shooting In Texas Was Minority And Gang-Related</Title><Username>grope_this_sportivo</Username><Timestamp>1358900524852</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 19:22:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>$70? $200?

The wrong victims, like the guy who got shot trying to rob a local bodega and other such "citizens saving their own rears" stories you're NOT going to hear even though the NRA publishes the top 12 or so such incidents each month in The American Rifleman. That's not the "right" message. In fact if you do the victim math right you could even argue that firearms in general are a Darwinian tool as they weed at those too stupid to know how to operate one and those too stupid to run away from them when they don't have one of their own (or even sometimes even if they do, but really can't hit the broad side of a barn).</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358907723421</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 21:22:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358908408056-12</Id><Topic><Title>Our next POTUS</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1358906752770</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 21:05:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is America getting ready to elect a failed comedian, failed talk show host, no brain, no single original idea to be a Commander in Cheif?
