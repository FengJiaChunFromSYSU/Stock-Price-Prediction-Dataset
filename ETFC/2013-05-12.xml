Of course like most "we want revenge" or "oh golly we're sorry" prosecutions they've waited until they won't have to put a significant number of the population in prison. When we get around to accountability, afterall, there is usually plenty to go around, and not just on the losing side. Let's see, Guatemala . . . cold war years, see what it tells me when enough people die to charge "genocide" and only one target is selected for trial, is that the trial is a sham. When the #$%$'s who orchestrated The Final Solution (the only real Genocide since the Turks and Armenians over half a century earlier) there were PLENTY of them to prosecute because implementing such an "action" is manpower intensive. While its possible Montt gave the orders though, where are those that carried them out? Are they going to prosecute EVERYONE who was with the Army or Police at the time? (Afterall in such a scenario all members of a unit are culpable) or isn't that political acceptable. For if Germany had tried to send everyone associated with the Death Camps to a camp themselves at the close of the war, we'd have had the few surviving prisoners, and the US Army, guarding most of the German population, and a good portion of the Russian and "Polish" liberating Armies. Yes, culpability is VERY easy to assign when you wait a half a century to do it.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368359167469</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 07:46:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368364974944-4</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo Impeached-Benghazi</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1368216356492</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:05:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo gun running to Al Queda ithrough Benghazi to Syria.

His goal is to make the USA on party - democRATS, totally depending on government just like Russia!!! He is not even following his European Model (Germany - SPD - Sozialistische Partei Deutschland) at this point, because he seeing them go down the tubes, including health care, social security, pensions, insurance costs, taxes/fees etc.! Biden would be clueless - totally because his mouth piece (directions) would be no longer able to tell him what to babble after him and Carney would have to learn to sing a new song! After "disinfecting" the White House, Biden might still prefer to run "Operations" out of his residence, of course under the "guidance" of Obimpolosi!
