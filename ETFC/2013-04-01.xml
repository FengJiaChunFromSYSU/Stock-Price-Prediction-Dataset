Walmart employs 2.2M people vs Costco's 174k. Walmart revenue is $447B vs Costco's $97B With less than 10% of Walmart's payroll Costco makes more than 20% of Walmart's revenue. That's why Costco can pay higher benefits. So, ask Costco to employ at least twice as many people and pay them same benefits as now. Will see how quickly Costco will go down. Yes, many in Walmart are on minimum wage. But they earn income. Nothing's wrong with that. Not happy with benefits? Apply to Costco. See how that's going to work. Both retailers are in the business to make money. They create jobs along the way. Costco makes more $$$ with less people. Costco is so rich! Why wouldn't they employ more!</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1364801654815</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 03:34:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364805987820-2</Id><Topic><Title>10 YEARS AGO, We Were At $42.10 Per Share...</Title><Username>rogerdonna_1988</Username><Timestamp>1363798724868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 12:58:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So this is like the buy of the century!

If you close all Walmart stores and replace them with Costco, we will be sitting with hundreds of thousands more unemployed. Not to mention, Walmart has much larger variety of products. I shop at Costco for 13 years. Never brought a single piece of cloth from this store. Costco for me is mainly about food, which Walmart is selling for convenience only, so does Target these days. It is apples and oranges. Ask single and retired people how much are they are interested in Costco. It is a store for family. Even with family some products are better to buy in lower quantities for higher price than large quantity at Costco cheaper but let half perish without use. You want $40K salary and health coverage for everyone? Ask Costco to give employment for all "underpaid", unhappy Walmart employees. It is about business in the first place. You display primitive view on two great retailers just based on your political views. It's sick. Both bring products people want.

Over the past 50 years, as tax rates have declined, there has been no increase in investment spending as a percentage of GDP. (The flat trend line shows that changes in the highest marginal income-tax rate have not affected investment much, one way or the other.) Instead, the investment share of the economy has been determined by other factors, such as aggregate demand, rather than tax policy Lower Taxes, Slower GDP Growth: Despite lower and declining tax rates, especially on the rich, the United States has had slower productivity growth over the last several decades than other advanced economies. Overall, lower taxes are associated with slower growth in GDP per hour worked.

At that time only the most extended leg of the human Diaspora, the indigenous people of the Americas, were in an equally primitive state. So, you're from a civilization that has gone from bronze arrowheads to steel mail, swords, and firearms in the last 4,000 years what would you conclude? So, how is it that slavers from Europe were able to buy captives taken by African tribes as if they were cattle when had an African ship landed in Spain and asked for slaves well, the response would have been something other than "how much each?". In fact the questioner would probably have gotten a sharp yard of steel for his answer. Why is it that the former jewel of Africa, the nation of Rhodesia, once a HUGE agricultural exporter, is now a famine stricken land of poverty called Zimbabwe? How can a civilizat . . .er, no, not a civilization because there were no cities and no one was really civilized, but rather a GROUP of people go 50,000+ years and not advance until finally recontacted by the descendants of people who left the area around that time and find themselves thinking them wizards, gods, or demons?

I wait with anticipation to see if the Union of South Africa goes the same way Zimbabwe did, are you willing to bet AGAINST it happening? Right now it could go either way, with one of the biggest moderating forces on the government right now being the attention of the world press.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1364845591773</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:46:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364846592988-29</Id><Topic><Title>stay away from the south?</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1364752202818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-31 13:50:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the fascist slave owners meant that owning slaves was OK for superior people like themselves. and btw, I guess you missed the fact that the good old USA was insisting on their right own slave after most other nations had outlawed it.

Here are the facts so far: "The lead suspect in the killings is a white supremacist prison gang called the Aryan Brotherhood of Texas. McLelland had said he believed the gang could have been responsible for Hasse's murder, noting that the group has a lot of members in the area and that his office has "put some real dents in the Aryan Brotherhood around here in the past year." A look at what authorities have so far gleaned about the Aryan Brotherhood's alleged involvement: First, McLelland wasn't exaggerating about the "dents." In July 2012, his office won a life sentence for an Aryan Brotherhood enforcer over a shoot-out with a wayward member in Terrell, Texas. The bigger hit to the gang, though, was an indictment unsealed in November against 34 alleged Aryan Brotherhood members, including four bosses. The multi-agency task force responsible for the indictment was based in Houston, but the Kaufman County D.A.'s office was among those credited for the "devastating blow." In December, the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a statewide warning that the Aryan Brotherhood might be "planning retaliation against law enforcement officials" who participated in the Houston case, adding that "high-ranking members" were "involved in issuing orders to inflict 'mass casualties or death' to law enforcement officials who were involved in cases where Aryan Brotherhood of Texas are facing life sentences or the death penalty." Hasse was not personally involved in the case, but he was gunned down on the same day two of the 34 Aryan Brotherhood members pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges in Dallas. The FBI and Kaufman County officials are also looking for a connection to the March 19 shooting of Colorado prisons director Tom Clements. Clements, like the McLellands, was shot inside his home.
