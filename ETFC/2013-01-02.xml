Bush and Ronald Reagan combined, and unlike either he has nothing to show for it. At least Reagan caused the downfall of Soviet Communism with a single nuke being fired, or for that matter any significant direct conflict between the two superpowers that might have ignited such a conflagration. Obama would stumble into a world war and not even KNOW it until the first one popped.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1357111732362</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 02:28:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357131143695-3</Id><Topic><Title>I will sell my entire position in ET if we go below 8 bucks</Title><Username>million_shares</Username><Timestamp>1355406433324</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 08:47:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I take my profit in etfc today.

For leech like you, who has nothing else to do but polluting this MB with your useless posts, it is impossible to comprehend that successful managing huge tasks as Utah Olimpics and being in control of large enterprise as Bain for 3 years is virtually impossible. Mitt was on top of Bain on record only. He didn't participate in company management, or especially major decision making. His office since 1999 was thousands miles away from MA.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1357155942814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:45:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357158102317-12</Id><Topic><Title>The BO KO</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1357091093451</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 20:44:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The taxpayer got KO'ed dummy.
