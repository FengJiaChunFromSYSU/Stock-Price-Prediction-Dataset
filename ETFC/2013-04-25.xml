Health bill a flop for House GOP leaders WASHINGTON - House Republican leaders suffered a humiliating legislative setback Wednesday when a large faction of GOP lawmakers rebelled against a leadership proposal that had drawn the opposition of powerful outside activists. The mutiny forced House Majority Leader Eric Cantor to abruptly pull from the floor legislation to shore up a program that allows people with pre-existing conditions to buy into an insurance pool for high-risk patients before they are able to transition to coverage under President Obama's AHC. The measure is part of Cantor's effort to rebrand the GOP after defeats in the 2012 presidential and Senate elections, but it quickly found resistance among conservative activists. rodent, I like to remind you again - Obamacare is not goiung away ever!!!</Msg><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1366909629615</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 13:07:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366910378557-4</Id><Topic><Title>Etrade Loans</Title><Username>pghkidinla</Username><Timestamp>1365957198670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 12:33:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK, then square this up for me. The PPL during the last quarter was 43mil along with a 13mil settlement for 56mil total. Audette the CFO said on the call, PPL would be in the 50-70mil range per quarter for 2013. THIS YEAR etrade will deduct about 240mil in loan loss provisions. The loan book is still bleeding but getting smaller, thus provisions and losses are getting smaller. However, since the loans generate interest income, the revenue for etrade is going lower due to the loan book shrinking, low interest rates, and low trading revenue. Any discussion of some kind of a dramatic turnaround in this loan book is simply dumb. Etrade won't even discuss selling all or a portion of the book at this time because they would have to take a big loss. Don't you think if Etrade could dump any of those loans for face value they would do it in a heartbeat? Listen to what they say and what they report. Anything else is just fantasy land.</Msg><Username>billwilliselkins</Username><Timestamp>1366910378557</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 13:19:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366915679980-5</Id><Topic><Title>Chechen Islamist brothers were the Boston bombers</Title><Username>croxcost</Username><Timestamp>1366374616708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 08:30:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Criminalizing abortion is untenable.

The question is how fast can you get that second shot lined up. Try it some time, it's more challenging than it appears. Alittle like going to play golf 2 balls at a time with your score in part on how fast you tee up that second shot. Further there's no point in shooting a deer to nothing, that's what we have pest animals like coyote and wild hogs for. With deer you want to save all the meat you can, particularly here in Texas where the heat means the deer don't grow as well as they do up north. It'd take two average deer kills here in Texas to approach the meat I got off ONE deer in Ohio. Of course you got m on the substitute for sex thing. Can't be having sex like a liberal as sperm combines with #$%$ to just make more liberals, so we have to get ourselves all #$%$ with a week of solid deer hunting before we're ready to waste energy on actual reproduction of people again.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1366917393618</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 15:16:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366917778601-7</Id><Topic><Title>Etrade Loans</Title><Username>pghkidinla</Username><Timestamp>1365957198670</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 12:33:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What happened in Texas doesn't help eTrade. Most eTrade loans weren't legal under Texas guidelines and so not many trash loans were written here. So we have an atypical but hopefully leading example. True, the NATIONAL market hasn't recovered yet to anything close to the rates prior to the collapse, but then only an idiot would have paid those prices in the first place. So, although Texas is a good bellwether marker for Texas and other conservative states with lending laws that prohibit the most onerous practices, it doesn't represent the more liberal lending laws in the nation as a whole, the prices for housing here still remaining reasonable even during the so called "housing bubble" which was really nothing more than blatant speculation in most markets. IF, and ONLY IF, ETrade keeps that portfolio until it regains value rather than selling it and taking loss will they be able to recover to a significant extent, in the meantime they'd be better off doing repossessions only when and if they can't get the loan holder to make at least interest payments on the loans. With the creation of a rental division they could at least get those homes back on the rental market and recover money, if not much, that way until the sales value returns.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1366917778601</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 15:22:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366919295437-8</Id><Topic><Title>Congress!</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1366904528815</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 11:42:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>** Obamacare is not goiung away ever!!!

You lock step defenders of this will be paying much higher premiums while the "poor and illegals" will be riding in the wagon at your exspence...as they say "caveat emptor" **on every other exchange across the country — might be too expensive for people to buy** Maryland Offers Glimpse at Obamacare Insurance Math Proposed premiums for new policies for individuals will rise by 25 percent on average next year. WEDNESDAY, April 24, 2013 (Kaiser Health News) — In the latest preview of prices for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, Maryland’s dominant insurer says proposed premiums for new policies for individuals will rise by 25 percent on average next year. That’s lower than what some had predicted. Just three weeks ago, the insurer, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, had been looking at a proposed 50 percent increase. But the company revised that initial estimate, citing worries about affordability for consumers. “Not only were we concerned about a potential hit to subscribers, but we were also concerned about price levels that were unattractive” to young customers seen as an important stabilizing force for the market, CareFirst CEO Chet Burrell said in an interview Wednesday. Late Tuesday Maryland regulators posted proposed rates and benefits for health plans to be sold through an online exchange, a step required under the health act, known as the Maryland Health Connection. Maryland is an important state to watch because it has embraced Obamacare’s insurance reforms, setting up its own marketplace. But there have been serious concerns that the insurance offered there — and on every other exchange across the country — might be too expensive for people to buy.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1366920354218</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 16:05:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366924716355-11</Id><Topic><Title>What's in your wallet</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1366920354218</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 16:05:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you sure are a cry baby and a worry wart and a whiner. why don't you move to a country that doesn't have universal healthcare, there aren't many in the modern world, but seem to want to live in a 3rd world country with no laws and ruled by the rich and well armed so try Yemen or Somalia.</Msg><Username>investorpelvis</Username><Timestamp>1366924716355</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 17:18:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366930138348-12</Id><Topic><Title>What's in your wallet</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1366920354218</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 16:05:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You need to wise up fast...you supporters will the first to be crying like a baby once it becomes unaffordable for you.
