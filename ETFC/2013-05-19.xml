I hadn't thought of that, I have MANY lodge pole pines on my property, and i have to cut some down anyway, I suppose i could use them as building materials for the outside of my new house rather than using them as retaining walls for the range backstops. At least that way I won't have to coat them in creosote. Linseed oil would work much better. I quant log cabin looks nice, is more resistant to casual hits (almost every building out there has at least ONE bullethole), and would help screen the presence of other things. And no, I'm still a City Slicker today, although I suppose a Dallas city slicker still puts me about 3 evolutionary steps above a Massachusetts/Boston one, and makes me appear a pure energy life form to someone from New York or New Jersey, but I'm not sure as I may never see such a person again. The way highways, railroads, etc, line up very few people will get OUT of those area when the food stops flowing IN, and in later years the question they'll get most tired of hearing will be "did you eat anyone getting out?" You, of course, won't mind this question. Fortunately the Westies have such good climate and good earth to plant in that if more than half of California starves in the first two years they have only themselves to blame. The rest of us will be fine, we remember the days when the United States was primarily an agrarian society and our parents didn't teach us to farm as a 4H project. For my mothers family in particular it was deadly serious work right up until her generation, and she was the first Conley in that branch of the Clan that emigrated from Ireland to graduate from a respectable (or any) College (OSU actually). Of course they were a combination of poor Irish and hideout Cherokee. If you would call THEM "Log Cabin Girl"'s then I'd be proud to count myself among them, and they could make that title their own, or they could leave you in a shallow hole in a south Ohio hillside. I vote the latter.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368986982976</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 14:09:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368987053132-24</Id><Topic><Title>BO the Conqueror</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1368975727429</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 11:02:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"O" could point to "M", say "I did not have sex with that Woman", and I'd believe him.

Hell I STARTED buying small lots at $18 though the difference between real value and the imaginary deflated value put on the company simply made it better and better, and the shares I got between $7.6 and $10, they're all gone (most of my position is in the $11 area now) at a nice profit, and now that we've hit the inflection point area (FINALLY! After 3 years!) I've put about HALF of my profit potential in LEAPS and closed out my position with control of around 5k shares. Half shares, half LEAPS. So the value returns, the stock price goes up (and I mean WAY the #$%$ up giving the money put into provisioning losses that will now never happen), and sooner or later, sooner for the options positions, MUCH later for the main positions, I'll sell my shares for darn near what they were worth before the collapse and reverse split. Happy happy joy joy. Frankly this was one of those investments that was fairly obvious on the value, it was just the time part that was fuzzy. The Grand Leader in office delayed that recovery only by about a year or so, so that makes this one of the best investments out there when the price was under $9. Now it's just one of the better investments out there at $11, if you can count $2 as being a significant draw off the $30 this stock may be selling for in two years, or the $150 in may be worth in 6.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368988478395</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 14:34:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368988675840-29</Id><Topic><Title>BO the Conqueror</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1368975727429</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 11:02:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell the DNC they won't get it until they've EARNED it.

For liberals, it’s all too easy to imagine the IRS targeting for special scrutiny groups with the words “99 percent” or “occupy” or “progressive” in their names, rather than “tea party” or “patriot.” And the belated IRS apology means little, as does the fact that the groups on the whole received the tax-exempt status they requested and--as Obama adviser David Plouffe pointed out--hugely outspent Democrats in the 2012 campaign.</Msg><Username>bypartisan305</Username><Timestamp>1368991792262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:29:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368993340467-33</Id><Topic><Title>Another Long Wknd w/Log Cabin Girls Hysteria</Title><Username>biddermoron_ca</Username><Timestamp>1368833933610</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 19:38:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Er, who cares who's on your ignore list? It's a weekend, not shitall going on, so if you're reading this board you obviously have nothing better to do at the moment, so you're thinking Im wasting your time . . . . I think that's funny in so many damn ways, but there's no need to list them, I think others here might figure them out, and you couldn't read it to realize what an idiot you are anyway. I just seldom see people DECLARE their idiocy as the ones who REALLY put me on ignore and mean it, don't bother to do anything but hit the button. Folks this is the first dude I've seen who's needed the self affirmation of declaring a by definition nullifying event. And it's not a diatribe, it's a monologue, note that differences. Apparently my detractor doesn't know the difference, and if you're to comment on his comment, its important that YOU do. If I engage in a diatribe it would start with questions like "what's a diatripe" (yes this is what the original author wrote) and then I'd warm him over a hot flame from there until I got as close as I could until breaking him . . . I hate that they're trying to make that illegal. I not only forced one guy into attempted suicide but totally destroyed his military career (well, that part might have nudged the suicidal tendencies along, but he career wasn't FOR SURE toast at that point) because he REALLY REALLY irritated me. Fortunately no one here would ever break those bounds as it required him being simultaneously an #$%$, posting from a position of authority, thinking he was considerably smarter than he was, all while playing in my so called back yards. Some day I may take those records and turn them into a web page, they'd be instructive, except nowdays the guy I field stripped and turned into a basket case in the 90's might sue me.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368993340467</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:55:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368994293254-34</Id><Topic><Title>Are there youtube videos that show people claiming the Benghazi attack was a response to a youtube video?</Title><Username>jimichimmi</Username><Timestamp>1368934125748</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 23:28:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually the guy who made the youtube video that was blamed for the attacks is in jail now.

Dude, I seem to remember he's white too, so if you want to use racial terms at least use the right ones, and say he's "colored". Afterall you seem to have the apartheid mindset of defining everything by its race, so you might as well be using the right terminology. Besides, it was Barak Obama that beat us, it was ourselves. The first time Rick Perry stood up as a national candidate then spent the next 15 minutes talking about his personal relationship with God, which from all his adjectives sounded like it would probably have been against Texas state law before a recent Court Decision, and that he sounded JUST like Bachmann and Santorum and that our only seemingly SANE candidates were a Mormon and someone who wanted to go back to the gold standard, and that the Democrats were running someone who's ONLY qualifications were being black, being articulate, having enough of a record to make some claims, but not enough to really examine them, and of course not having a felony record, I knew we were doomed. That's why I exited the market in mid 2007 and bought land in the middle of nowhere, the day Barak Obama announced he was entering the primary, I knew he'd win the race unless the Republican party could create a viable field of candidates instead of what amounted to a national joke.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368998159917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 17:15:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368999759384-44</Id><Topic><Title>"This is not Watergate," the Washington Post's Bob Woodward said Sunday on "Meet the Press,"</Title><Username>unluckyspankerbill</Username><Timestamp>1368997975449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 17:12:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>85% of All Pedophila Rape is Geeeh Rape.

Judson Phillips, the founder of the (for-profit) Tea Party Nation filed for bankruptcy in 1999, and had $22,000 in federal tax liens in his past. After Tea Party Nation planned a July 2010 tea party convention in Las Vegas and then canceled due to lack of interest, the organization stiffed the Venetian Hotel for more than 1,500 rooms it had reserved. That resulted in a judge ordering the organization to repay the hotel nearly $750,000. And then there was tea partier Christine O'Donnell, the Senate candidate from Delaware whose IRS tax lien for nearly $12,000 came to light during her 2010 campaign. Conservatives now say there was a partisan motive behind the IRS targeting of tea party groups. (An Inspector General's report released Tuesday did not find any evidence to that effect.) As evidence, they point to a lack of similar scrutiny directed at liberal groups. But it is also true that the tea party movement does not have an equivalent on the left; the Occupy Wall Street movement, perhaps the closest parallel, did not receive financial support on the scale that tea party organizations did, nor did it spawn legions of aspiring tax-exempt groups. When Occupy groups did seek out formal structure, they tended to use the traditional charitable 501(c)(3) status, which bars all political activity. The tea partiers, on the other hand, went for the c(4) designation for political non-profit organizations, helping make them the focus, as we now know, of IRS staffers."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1369021790989</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 23:49:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
