Insurance companies have been expert gougers for over two decades, but prohibiting health insurance companies from doing business in one state was passed ONLY to break up Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which had, ON THEIR OWN, created what amounted to an almost universally subscribed health care system. Aside from "breaking up the Blues", it also had the effect of shattering the health insurance industry while creating an unmentionable mess where deals between major companies in a given area are more likely to set the regional rate than any sane measure of risk. So you COULD say we already had it, until Big Government made it illegal because Big Government wanted a piece of the action, and BC/BS wasn't giving in. Golly Gee. We could just roll back all Health Insurance legislation leading up to and including that point, and that would have gone a HUGE way to clearing the way to universal heath care, but that would be TOO simple, and wouldn't employ but a TINY fraction of the government bureaucrats this boondoggle will keep at their desks. Maybe they'll spend it denying the claims of conservative voters.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1370012265832</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 10:57:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370012634101-11</Id><Topic><Title>THEE place for pup tents</Title><Username>e.dilutionn</Username><Timestamp>1369963759257</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 21:29:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you have a point or are idiotic refrains so embarrassing even to you that you used this burner ID to post them?</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1370012634101</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 11:03:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370016167704-12</Id><Title>ACA offers reasonable health insurance prices in Ca (no matter how the liars spin it)</Title><Msg>an OP-ed piece in Forbes screams that obamacare has hike the cost of insurance in Ca over 100%..... but they are not honest.... they cite that a high deductible plan for a 25 year old will cost $184 a month...OMG!!!! jeez... and yes that might be double the cost of a plan that excludes many things or might dump you for preexisting conditions or any other or no reason at all........jeez..........by why listen to anyone, just go to the web site of Covered California and use their calculator to see your cost for a 'silver' plan.....

I read that article. I didn't know that Forbes was another shoddy conservative mouthpiece - now I do! gerbil, I like doing a little research on something new; clearly a train missing by ignorant lazy Faux news sheep who find the words they're looking for and blindly repeat them. Anyway, back the Forbes article. The article likes to reference comparisons between apples and Faux news sheep (note: apples are actually smarter) while writing about $97 a month health coverage which is lower than the $184 / month health exchange premium (NOT) ! First - the $184 is Not the lowest health exchange premium rate, quote from Forbes " (That’s the median monthly premium across California’s 19 insurance rating regions.)" so 1/2 the rates are higher than $184 and half are Lower- the median rate is not the same as the lowest rate! While Forbes was honest enough to note the their apples to sheep comparison, they clearly knew that conservanutes would glomp onto whatever ignorance supported their perspective... Second, that Forbes $97 low end rate is catastrophic coverage for someone whose never been to the doctor, never taken an antibiotic, never had a cold (this person is as rare as an intelligent faux news follower), while the health exchange rate accepts pre existing conditions and has significant basic coverage that far exceeds the non-existent $97 coverage. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to discover that Forbes is just another conservanut ragmag for conseranut morons.</Msg><Username>bypartisan305</Username><Timestamp>1370017723584</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 12:28:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370018051486-17</Id><Topic><Title>146% Obamascare Increase in California!!!</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1370007220252</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 09:33:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My healthcare is 130% in 3 years and I just got another 30% increase notice.

State officials last week unveiled the health plans and premium rates that will be available under the California health exchange. They show the market is working as intended – actually better. Thirty-three health plans – including some from out of state – competed to offer plans for the uninsured who don't get insurance through an employer, through Medicare (the federal insurance program for the elderly) or Medi-Cal (the federal-state partnership providing insurance for lower-income Americans). Thirteen plans were selected. Residents in every region – including rural areas – will have a choice among at least three insurance companies. Some will have as many as six. Residents of the Sacramento, Placer, El Dorado, Yolo region will have a choice among four insurance companies – Anthem, Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente and Western Health Advantage. The exchange rejected bids that were too high, or didn't have a strong network of doctors and hospitals. The competition has brought the rates lower than expected – even for so-called "young invincibles." Some experts have worried that younger people would choose to pay the penalty ($95 or 1 percent of income in 2014, and increasing in later years) rather than buy insurance. But with premium prices in line with what employers pay for insurance and federal subsidies for individuals making less than $46,000 a year and families earning below $94,000 – not the excessive rates of the past individual market – that should change. It did with the Massachusetts exchange, which has been in place since 2007. Among young men, the rates of uninsured fell from 19 percent in 2006 to 9 percent in 2008. Among young women, from 7 percent to 3 percent.

Rate Shock: In California, Obamacare To Increase Individual Health Insurance Premiums By 64-146% Braly, then-CEO of WellPoint, testified before Congress about allegations that its California unit, Anthem Blue Cross, was raising premiums on some customers by more than 30 percent. Last week, California announced that the Affordable Care Act would increase non-group insurance premiums by as much as 146 percent. (Image courtesy U.S. House of Representatives) Last week, the state of California claimed that its version of Obamacare’s health insurance exchange would actually reduce premiums. “These rates are way below the worst-case gloom-and-doom scenarios we have heard,” boasted Peter Lee, executive director of the California exchange. But the data that Lee released tells a different story: Obamacare, in fact, will increase individual-market premiums in California by as much as 146 percent. One of the most serious flaws with Obamacare is that its blizzard of regulations and mandates drives up the cost of insurance for people who buy it on their own.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1370023588060</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 14:06:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370023855420-30</Id><Topic><Title>146% Obamascare Increase in California!!!</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1370007220252</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 09:33:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Liberals on defense..oh yeah!!</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1370023855420</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 14:10:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370023920515-31</Id><Topic><Title>13 bush and gop benghazis ALL could have been prevented in hindsight</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370017366332</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 12:22:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just cut the #$%$, there is only one thing pubs are angy about.

State officials last week unveiled the health plans and premium rates that will be available under the California health exchange. They show the market is working as intended – actually better. Thirty-three health plans – including some from out of state – competed to offer plans for the uninsured who don't get insurance through an employer, through Medicare (the federal insurance program for the elderly) or Medi-Cal (the federal-state partnership providing insurance for lower-income Americans). Thirteen plans were selected. Residents in every region – including rural areas – will have a choice among at least three insurance companies. Some will have as many as six. Residents of the Sacramento, Placer, El Dorado, Yolo region will have a choice among four insurance companies – Anthem, Blue Shield, Kaiser Permanente and Western Health Advantage. The exchange rejected bids that were too high, or didn't have a strong network of doctors and hospitals. The competition has brought the rates lower than expected – even for so-called "young invincibles." Some experts have worried that younger people would choose to pay the penalty ($95 or 1 percent of income in 2014, and increasing in later years) rather than buy insurance. But with premium prices in line with what employers pay for insurance and federal subsidies for individuals making less than $46,000 a year and families earning below $94,000 – not the excessive rates of the past individual market – that should change. It did with the Massachusetts exchange, which has been in place since 2007. Among young men, the rates of uninsured fell from 19 percent in 2006 to 9 percent in 2008. Among young women, from 7 percent to 3 percent.</Msg><Username>rampant_rose</Username><Timestamp>1370025059615</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 14:30:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370025349726-39</Id><Topic><Title>Beirut bombing COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370018190685</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 12:36:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was "W's" fault, leave Reagan out of this, he was building a fence on his ranch in Santa Barbra.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1370025349726</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 14:35:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370025660802-40</Id><Title>gerbil, It is Friday (2:37 p.m. in D.C.)

There are two Affordable Care Acts. There's the legislation passed by Congress in 2009, and then there's the mythical Affordable Care Act – the perfidious “government takeover” decried and demagogued by so many conservatives (and quite a few liberals). The former is quite popular, the latter gets decidedly mixed reviews. Don't take my word for it. A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found Americans split down the middle, with 41 percent approving of the law, and 40 percent saying they didn't like it ( PDF). But then Kaiser asked about 12 specific provisions in the legislation, and found that, on average, 63 percent of respondents approved of the nuts and bolts of Obamacare. Of the 12 measures they tested, only one – the controversial mandate to carry health insurance or pay a penalty – received the approval of less than half of Americans (35 percent). Or consider this divide: while only 12 percent of Republicans had a positive view of the law overall, 47 percent, on average, viewed its specifics favorably. And here's the kicker: Kaiser found that the most popular parts of the law were also the ones most Americans weren't aware of, and vice-versa. Almost everyone knows about the mandate, which most people don't like, but fewer than half of those polled knew about the law's tax credits for small businesses that offer their employees coverage, a provision that eight out of 10 people liked when they heard about it. None of this should come as a surprise, given the level of mendacity of the law's opponents. If the Affordable Care Act did in fact feature “ death panels,” resulted in deep cuts to Medicare, represented a " massive” tax increase and</Msg><Username>returnuspompus</Username><Timestamp>1370027916480</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 15:18:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370028792321-44</Id><Title>Reason NO ONE Likes Obamacare</Title><Msg>It Sucks!</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1370028792321</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 15:33:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370030423485-45</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare premiums in California lower than predicted</Title><Username>sec_fordummies</Username><Timestamp>1369420712661</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 14:38:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>amen to that!</Msg><Username>oldtimer60</Username><Timestamp>1370030423485</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 16:00:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370030586953-46</Id><Topic><Title>146% Obamascare Increase in California!!!</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1370007220252</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 09:33:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Heh, Liberals, after 3 years of passing this disaster, why do you have to keep selling Obamacare?

The success of the Affordable Care Act partially hinges on competition in order to keep premiums low, and, according to the memo, "the early signs are promising and demonstrate a significant increase in competition and an array of options for consumers everywhere." One out of four insurers that have applied to sell insurance in the marketplace is new to the individual insurance market and at least one new provider has been added in 75 percent of states with a federally run marketplace. The White House estimates that about 90 percent of target enrollees will have five or more different insurance company choices. People can start enrolling in the exchanges on Oct. 1. The federal government will fully run the health care exchanges in 19 states and will work with 15 other states to help them run a marketplace. Seventeen states (including D.C.) have opted to run their own exchanges.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1370038848231</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 18:20:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370039379473-55</Id><Topic><Title>Another Obamacare TRIUMPH!!!!</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1370038848231</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 18:20:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Triumph, like Barney Franks Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or perhaps a win like the DOJ, or maybe a victory like the IRS?</Msg><Username>resjuda</Username><Timestamp>1370039379473</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 18:29:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370039843066-56</Id><Title>Consumer Confidence at 5 Year High !</Title><Msg>Sales are up on big ticket items.
