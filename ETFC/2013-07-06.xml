When you play chess game one second may be enough in one situation and one hour may be insufficient in another. Yet, there are appropriate time limits. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that W did something inappropriate by spending few minutes with kids after he heard the news. Within few months of Daniel Peal's murder in Pakistan, his killer, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, was captured and sentenced to death, KSM captured and brought to US custody. This is a similar case under Bush administration. This administration was sitting on their hands for 9 hours while watching what's happening in Benghazi. And 9 months later, not even a sign of interest to find and punish perpetrators. Those 7 minutes which couldn't and didn't affect anything are big Bush's failure. But doing nothing in first 9 hours and following 9 months in Benghazi case is perfectly acceptable. Jay Carney already call it an old news. And Obama worshipers agree. It's not about rights and wrongs anymore.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1373161370626</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 21:42:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
