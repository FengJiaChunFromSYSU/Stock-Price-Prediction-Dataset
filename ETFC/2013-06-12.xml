The poll, conducted from Friday to Tuesday, found that few were completely untroubled by the news that the National Security Agency has been secretly monitoring telephone and Internet activity of millions of Americans. More than one in three of those surveyed said the activity was completely unacceptable. Others sought a middle ground, saying the government needed to balance national security with personal privacy and explain why the activity was necessary. "I like to believe that everything they're doing is in the national interest," said Minneapolis waiter Stephen Johansson, 25. "But I think it should be something that has to be explained rather than just done." The online poll of 835 Americans has a credibility interval of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. About 35 percent of those surveyed said the NSA's collection of domestic phone records should be acceptable under only limited circumstances while another 13 percent said it would be acceptable under most circumstances. Some 47 percent said they would prefer the NSA not review their phone records but would find it acceptable if the agency had a good reason to do so.

Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told reporters on Tuesday that Edward Snowden, who disclosed details about two programs, should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. McConnell said the Director of National Intelligence declassified some details of the programs that shows they were authorized by law, overseen by Congress and the courts and subject to review. The lawmaker said that given the scope of the programs, the privacy concerns were understandable.

Democrats protested the bill's merits and the process by which it was passed. Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) cut off debate after half an hour Wednesday and Democrats howled in protest. The bill had been debated for hours Tuesday, but Democrats managed to block a final vote on it that day. The measure passed 17-15, with all Republicans for it and all Democrats against it. Sen. Luther Olsen (R-Ripon) was absent. The bill also requires physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges within 30 miles of the clinics where they work. That provision would shut down one of the state's four abortion clinics, according to opponents. Closing Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin's Appleton clinic would mean Milwaukee and Madison would be the only cities in the state where abortions were available. Good job WI republicans, 44th in job creation and 49th in economic outlook, and you go and pass this #$%$?

The letter was also signed by eight other Senators, including John Kerry (D-MA) and Chuck Hagel (R-ND). Obama criticized Patriot Act before he became president, and he signs its extension without reforms in 2010. Better! He "improves" it 1000%. Didn't you vote for him twice?</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1371093760549</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-12 23:22:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
