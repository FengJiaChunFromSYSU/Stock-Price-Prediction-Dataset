But these days, anything is possible. You never know what is next. Every rally appears to be a short squeeze. The next rally will be a short squeeze of those who just established short positions today. That's the cause of the market surge, I guess.</Msg><Username>etfc2013</Username><Timestamp>1361168182687</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 01:16:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361197035590-2</Id><Title>Look Ma!

Paul and Lucy Burns led a series of protests against the Wilson Administration in Washington. Wilson ignored the protests for six months, but on June 20, 1917, as a Russian delegation drove up to the White House, suffragists unfurled a banner which stated: "We women of America tell you that America is not a democracy. Twenty million women are denied the right to vote. President Wilson is the chief opponent of their national enfranchisement".[87] Another banner on August 14, 1917, referred to "Kaiser Wilson" and compared the plight of the German people with that of American women. With this manner of protest, the women were subject to arrests and many were jailed.[88] On October 17, Alice Paul was sentenced to seven months and on October 30 began a hunger strike, but after a few days prison authorities began to force feed her.[87] After years of opposition, Wilson changed his position in 1918 to advocate women's suffrage as a war measure.[89] The key vote came on June 4, 1919, when the Senate approved the amendment by 56 to 25 after four hours of debate, during which Democratic Senators opposed to the amendment filibustered to prevent a roll call until their absent Senators could be protected by pairs. The Ayes included 36 (82%) Republicans and 20 (54%) Democrats. The Nays comprised 8 (18%) Republicans and 17 (46%) Democrats. It was ratified by sufficient states in 1920, the Nineteenth Amendment, which prohibited state or federal sex-based restrictions on voting." Woodrow Wilson long time ignored the issue, most of the Democrats opposed it.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1361209598268</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 12:46:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361214131632-7</Id><Topic><Title>Mississippi Has Finally Definitely Ratified the Thirteenth Amendment</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1361207446630</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 12:10:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"racist and misogynist south dems all became pukes with the passage of the 1965 civil rights legislation" A proof?

Just think you could drive a nice golf cart for exercise in fresh air down town LA, have a cigar instead of a stinky cigarette, pound down a few cocktails for circulation, eat some cheeseburgers to replace the worn off calories and talk smart how you voted for the democRATS!!! - Now that's impressive!

And the difference is? Remember ANY kind of government coericion over free speech or free exercise of opinion is an infringement on the first amendment unless the that speech has no meaningful value or is used to incite riots, civil unrest, or to provoke anarchy. Technically common carriers like Yahoo and Google shouldn't even be able to delete SPAM without a court case finding that SPAM has no legitimate 1st amendment protection.

Let the schmucks work while they enjoy all the welfare benifits. We go to work so they can stay home and have babies and become the majority....liberalism is a mental disorder. A Muslim preacher is secretly filmed urging followers to take benefits from the state to fund a holy war. Anjem Choudary was secretly filmed mocking non-Muslims for working in 9-5 jobs their whole lives, and told followers that some revered Islamic figures had only ever worked one or two days a year. “The rest of the year they were busy with jihad [holy war] and things like that,” he said. “People will say, ‘Ah, but you are not working’. “But the normal situation is for you to take money from the kuffar [non-believers]. “So we take Jihad Seeker’s Allowance. You need to get support.” He went on to tell a 30-strong crowd: “We are going to take England — the Muslims are coming.” Ridiculing the daily lives of UK workers, Choudary said: “You find people are busy working the whole of their life. They wake up at 7 o’clock. They go to work at 9 o’clock. “They work for eight, nine hours a day. They come home at 7 o’clock, watch EastEnders, sleep, and they do that for 40 years of their life. That is called slavery.” Choudary, a father-of-four, claims more than £25,000 a year in benefits, £8,000 more than the take-home pay of some soldiers fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan, according to the Sun, which covertly filmed the preacher at three meetings.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1361227128620</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 17:38:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361227376344-13</Id><Topic><Title>Where is our lazy President?</Title><Username>coward_of_benghazi</Username><Timestamp>1361110231624</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 09:10:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>**Why do you have to let the whole world know you are a partisan simpleton?** But not you, you are completely objective...lol</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1361227376344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 17:42:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361228179567-14</Id><Title>Gas prices up 32 days and counting</Title><Msg>The result of Bernanke and Obama's policies...and who does it hurt most, the poor and the middle class.
