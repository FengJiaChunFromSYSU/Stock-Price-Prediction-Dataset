Another Democratic lie..."you have to pass it to know what is in it" You dopes on the left sure are a gullible lot...better be careful what you wish for. State lacks doctors to meet demand of national healthcare law SACRAMENTO â€” As the state moves to expand healthcare coverage to millions of Californians under President Obama's healthcare law, it faces a major obstacle: There aren't enough doctors to treat a crush of newly insured patients. Some lawmakers want to fill the gap by redefining who can provide healthcare. They are working on proposals that would allow physician assistants to treat more patients and nurse practitioners to set up independent practices. Pharmacists and optometrists could act as primary care providers, diagnosing and managing some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and high-blood pressure. "We're going to be mandating that every single person in this state have insurance," said state Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), chairman of the Senate Health Committee and leader of the effort to expand professional boundaries.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360612236718</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 14:50:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360619047104-4</Id><Topic><Title>Bartiromo</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1360617886656</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 16:24:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe she can share a cell with cramer</Msg><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1360619047104</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 16:44:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360620937957-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare, got doctors</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360612236718</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 14:50:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My Grandfather was a revered Opthamologist/Optometrist....His son was also; recently retired.
