For every gun that is prevented from crossing the boarder, we get to send one illegal Mexican back to Mexico. Here in Californisa 50% of all accidents are hit and run, while the national average is 10%....I wonder who these folks are, and why are they leaving the scene of the crime? 54,000 Mexicans sign petition for US gun control Mexico City. More than 54,000 Mexicans have signed a petition calling on the United States to take further steps to combat weapons trafficking. Mexico says the majority of guns used by the country's violent drug cartels are smuggled over the border from the United States. Mexico's best-known anti-violence activist and a prominent intellectual presented the petition at the U.S. embassy Monday. Activist Javier Sicilia said "The United States is partly responsible for our humanitarian tragedy." About 70,000 people have died in Mexico in drug violence since 2006, according to the written copy of a speech presented by Mexico's interior secretary in December. Before the activists presented their petition, President Barack Obama said Monday he would present a new U.S. gun control plan within days.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358284255615</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 16:10:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358284645776-12</Id><Topic><Title>Mexicans want US gun control</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358284255615</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 16:10:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no Birth certificate stupid Zebra's Fast and Furious gun program clearly is popular!!</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1358284645776</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 16:17:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358284862025-13</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC upgraded target 11$</Title><Username>frwtrade</Username><Timestamp>1358250358704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 06:45:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I like the way it has been creeping up...super bowl ads could ad some #$%$ to it more babies on the way?</Msg><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1358284862025</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 16:21:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358285220601-14</Id><Topic><Title>I want my 40 acres and a mule</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358278827580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 14:40:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>**Black Americans (slaves) built the White House: Which means the "White House" has been "Black" sense day one** Even for you, that has to be the most ill conceived logic so far in 2013.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358285220601</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 16:27:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358285348579-15</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC upgraded target 11$</Title><Username>frwtrade</Username><Timestamp>1358250358704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 06:45:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are in no condition to spend 2.5 million on another Super Bowl ad which does not even move the needle with account growth.
