The group was created by the King Street Patriots, a Houston-based tea party organization and a 501(c)(4). But True the Vote is a 501(c)(3), a tax-exempt designation that allows a group's donors to write off their contributions but also has strict rules prohibiting electioneering and partisan political activity. True the Vote and King Street share board members and often co-sponsored events. True the Vote trained volunteers to go into predominantly minority neighborhoods across the country and keep an eye on potential violations by presumed Democratic voters. Its activities drew accusations of voter intimidation; in Ohio, its volunteers were banned from Franklin County polling places amid allegations that it had forged signatures to secure poll-watcher status. In Texas, True the Vote's alleged partisan activity included a poll-watching guide instructing trainees to consult the Harris County Republican Party website for advice on voting rules, and the group only invited Republicans to its candidate forums.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1369022423727</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 00:00:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369022465299-2</Id><Topic><Title>Mother Jones article</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1369021790989</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 23:49:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Catherine Engelbrecht, True the Vote's president, is among those now complaining that her group was inappropriately targeted. "The IRS treatment of us lends to the appearance of a politically-motivated abuse of power and an assault on free speech," she told Breitbart News. (She did not respond to a request for comment.) Engelbrecht has released a letter from the IRS requesting extensive documentation and information from True the Vote as part of its nonprofit application. But the IRS' requests point to concerns that critics have long raised about the organization. In 2010, an ethics complaint and lawsuit against King Street Patriots alleged illegal political activity, and last year a Texas judge agreed, ruling that the organization was not a nonprofit but in fact was operating like a political action committee and illegally helping the GOP. In August 2012, True the Vote donated $5,000 to the Republican State Leadership Committee, a 527 group that raised nearly $30 million dollars to elect GOP candidates in state legislatures."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1369022465299</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 00:01:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369027875289-3</Id><Topic><Title>Another Long Wknd w/Log Cabin Girls Hysteria</Title><Username>biddermoron_ca</Username><Timestamp>1368833933610</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 19:38:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Besides, it was Barak Obama that beat us, it was ourselves." and you still want to sell it that you are not a republican.

So, why is text, and code that I wrote more than 30 years ago still easily available when somehow we can't even find ANYTHING that Obama published to get his degree. Sounds like his was a great deal easier, requires a great deal less skill, and certainly requires a great deal less creativity. And President Obama voted HOW may times in the Senate (other than voting "Present")? Like I said, the Republican Party ran against a specter. I suppose if my party was willing to put out what amounted to a casting call for a Presidential Candidate, must have no fixed public positions that can't easily be modified by the phrase "I've been thinking" mostly because the candidate is capable ONLY of those thoughts issued by the campaign. Nothing illustrated that more clearly than Guantanamo where, when Obama finally got the REAL information, he reversed himself faster than an old GT at a Demo Derby. It's the only thing I respect about him. One of the reason he's been one of the most "conservative" Democratic Presidents is that he DOES have a mind of his own, he just doesn't use it enough, or rather he does but doesn't have enough time in the day to read and learn enough to expel all that #$%$ he picked up between Indonesia and Washington D.C. and figure out what's really going on. Dreams of his fathers indeed when the only dream his father had with regard to geo-politics was the destruction of the Western Powers.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369034965928</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 03:29:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369035234081-5</Id><Topic><Title>Reason CBS 60 minutes not reporting Benghazi is: CORRUPTION</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369008258863</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 20:04:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>People kind of figured that out when they were given a Word document in default format as evidence of George Bush's misdoings in the early 70's (long before Word was even a gleam in Bill Gates eye, not that it ever was, it was just cool to steal, yet another liberal icon).

Now, it's a bit of a stretch to accuse them of being gay, but its certainly a stretch to call them, all at the same time, lying, gay, conservatives. Don't you? I mean, how many gay conservatives do you know, because I've met ONE my entire life. Given that my wife used to hang around with the University theater department that's quite an accomplishment. And of course a Conservative's opinions are mainstream, unless you think a Liberal wrote the Constitution, giving us a REPUBLICan style government with a DEMOCRATIC bi-cameral system but no direct votes by the citizens on anything but constitutional changes. That'd be our founders, who kept the common man away from the federal franchise because they realized, particularly at their time, that the vast bulk of the public wasn't prepared to do more than comment on international and significant national questions. You see, education was far from universal in the 18th Century. So yes, Conservative opinions ARE by and large mainstream and outside certain very very large urban areas. that have sort of become their own crime ridden debt ridden and free-loader ridden pits. it remains one. That doesn't mean conservatives don't accept SOME liberal ideas, it just means the liberals refuse to acknowledge it when they DO. I note Bush is still being pounded on despite being out of office more than a term and passing one of the largest expansion of public entitlements since Medicare by creating the Prescription Drug benefit.

Yeah, and that worked out SO well with the "at protest" voter registration drives (liberals only please), riots, and whatnot. There was a brief occupy protest in Dallas, but since Texans are Texans, even when they are liberal Texans, it only lasted part of a day because they large came out, said what they had to say (and not all at once, Texans are first individuals, not monotone collective screamers), and then went home.

"UC Law School statement: The Law School has received many media requests about Barack Obama, especially about his status as "Senior Lecturer." From 1992 until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004, Barack Obama served as a professor in the Law School. He was a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996. He was a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004, during which time he taught three courses per year. Senior Lecturers are considered to be members of the Law School faculty and are regarded as professors, although not full-time or tenure-track. The title of Senior Lecturer is distinct from the title of Lecturer, which signifies adjunct status.

Otherwise yes, I'd imagine their TELEVISION viewership is down, but then so are almost ALL informational viewing channels. People are simply finding it easier to get that information on the internet,, so as far as "television" is concerned the only outlets making money are broadcasting sports or entertainment (in which category we'll count "home shopping" which, given the internet, I can't understand how it could still exist). Finally, it doesn't MATTER even if Barry manages to TOTALLY suppress Fox, you can always get it in the foreign press. They don't worship at Barry's feet so they're not afraid to offend Der Furher. If Bush had been so sloppy as to do the sorts of things that the Obama administration has done and gotten away with he'd be pilloried in the press daily until the end of time. Obama doesn't have to worry about that because, golly, for some reason he can do no wrong even in a situation where nothing has gone right. He's alienated our allies, forced our enemies into corners they can't back out of, and in general screwed up our foreign policy for at least the next decade BUT, at least he DOES have the right idea for the war on terror. We have a new drone, you won't read about it for awhile, well, maybe sooner as its alittlte large, that can go anywhere . . . which is where we intend to send it, without warning, and without fanfare. So, slumming in Tehran waiting for your next Hizbollah mission, don't feel so safe, we no longer consider some countries to be sovereign anymore. Even some we do will have unexplained explosions from cellulose cased bombs that will be difficult to attribute to any particular nation with accuracy, and almost EVERY part of the drone (except some engine parts) are designed to combust, so it can't be captured.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369074868800</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 14:34:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369074940618-34</Id><Topic><Title>You have to read the foreign news . . .</Title><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369071870356</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 13:44:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, and when I say "meant to combust" I mean that many parts, like CPU motherboards, are made of plastics that are more related to C4 than PVC.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369074940618</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 14:35:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369076020135-35</Id><Title>this is an ETFC board not a politico wash out board..</Title><Msg>who cares anyway about a lame duck pres and congress..</Msg><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1369076020135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 14:53:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369076175140-36</Id><Topic><Title>You have to read the foreign news . . .</Title><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369071870356</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 13:44:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, viewers are finally getting wise: The experts are chalking this up to competition from the internet, says Ellen at News Hounds, but that's only part of it.

Pierce Long ago, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur of Ohio once told me that she thought my craft went bad when it became the province almost exclusively of the over-educated, that it had professionalized itself out of its traditional role, that she wished there were a few more people practicing journalism who'd first worked on a loading dock, or in a mine, the way people used to come to the job. Here, with Karl, we apparently have a perfect product of the well-financed and staggeringly successful network of conservative institutions and programs launched more than 40 years ago by The Powell Memo. Assuming the FAIR report is accurate, then Jonathan Karl was not trained as a journalist, because the Collegiate Network doesn't produce journalists. It produces partisan warriors. He was not trained as a reporter, because the Collegiate Network doesn't produce reporters. It produces propagandists. He was not trained as a newsman, because the Collegiate Network doesn't produce newsmen. It produces hacks. This is, of course, indelicate for someone in my business to say but, at every level of his steady rise in the business, some executive should have looked at Karl's resume, seen The Collegiate Network there, and then shitcanned the thing before the interview process even began. Are there conservatives who are good reporters? Absolutely. But all the ones that I know came up the same way I did, and none of them came up through the coddled terrariums of the activist Right. They learned their craft. They were not trained to be spies in the camp of the enemy. They were not trained to be moles. And every damn one of them would have checked those phony e-mails before throwing them out to the public, and most of them wouldn't have fallen for them, because they are journalists, reporters, and newsmen. They are not partisan warriors, propagandists, or hacks. If Jonathan Karl doesn't like being called a hack, then he should stop being a hack and expose his source..</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369082435329</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 16:40:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369082535276-43</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi-Killary vs. Black Hawk Down</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1368959464425</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 06:31:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hillary has had a long life of continual Corruption and Crimes.

When host David Gregory pressed her on the lack of evidence for her claims that the IRS scandal was worse than Watergate, Noonan insisted that the president “was giving a dog whistle to people who could launch this thing.” The former Reagan-Bush speechwriter vividly summed up, in her thousand points of crazy style, where the IRS “scandal” went over the last few days: Obama didn’t need to order the tax agency to harass Tea Party groups (and his critics don’t need proof that he did so): his criticizing the group during the 2012 campaign, as well as blasting the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, represented an implicit order to do so. (Noonan, who we must presume as entirely blotted all of pre-2008 Republican history from her mind, also said "this IRS thing is something I've never seen in my lifetime," which is known Washington-wide as a phrase that signals a need to call the number on the speaker's medical alert bracelet.) To be fair to Noonan, she's not entirely off the farm on this one (or, rather, the whole farm is tagging along with her; the fences are in a bit of a state of disrepair, these days.) The "dog whistle" bit seems to be the new purported explanation for why something that apparently didn't involve Obama in fact deeply involves Obama, and is worse than Watergate precisely because it didn't involve Obama, or some such. Obama is so evil that he doesn't even have to tell his subordinates to target his enemies, they just do it on based on evil osmosis. Nixon specifically ordered the IRS to go after his opponents. Obama didn't, you see, and that makes the Obama administration … worse. If you can understand that, you are either a Republican political strategist or under the influence of a drug you don't have a prescription for."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369093666712</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 19:47:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369093967478-61</Id><Title>Hillary humped Dumbo (Benghazi)</Title><Msg>That's why no one will report where the 2 slimers were during the 9 hours of Benghazi War.
