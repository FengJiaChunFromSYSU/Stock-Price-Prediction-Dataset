Ninety-percent of what the House is doing is nothing more than a colossal waste of time. Even Fox News doesn't cover it. No one but Cantor even cares about it. Speaker Boehner has totally checked out. Do you know how he plans to act if the Senate passes immigration reform? Does he? It's almost as if the House Republicans have had their central nervous system removed. There is no brain activity. Even the think tanks have stopped trying to be even remotely serious. The Heritage Foundation made Jim DeMint their director and promptly put a guy in charge of their immigration reform analysis who posted at racist websites and did his college thesis on how stupid Latinos are. Plus, their data was laughed out of town by Republicans. It's gotten to the point that Democratic wonks are lamenting that they no longer have anyone honest to debate. What the GOP is doing makes no sense. They behave as if they can get 100% of what their most radical and deluded members want even though they only technically control one half of Congress and there is a relatively popular and freshly-reelected Democrat in the White House. It doesn't matter how many times the Speaker points those facts out, he has no ability to get those facts to sink in. They act like President Obama is more intransigent than President Clinton, but the Gingrich-led Congress actively worked to find areas where they could work with Clinton. When Boehner tried to do that, he almost lost his speakership. And Gingrich had a lot more leverage because Bob Dole and Trent Lott were in control of the Senate. I believe the root problem here is that Republicans told lies for so long that they finally produced a generation of officeholders who actually confuse lies with the truth. They got high on their own supply. No wonder Bob Dole thinks they need to go to a collective rehab.

That is WAY TOO LIBERAL. The whole point behind being Conservative it to oppose any progress and fight any new ideas.... Conservatives, by default believe that all the "good stuff" was already invented, tried and was proven true and should never ever change. Example,.... women should be submissive slaves, not allowed to vote or even speak up, and God forbid if they tried to do mans work. Some conservative circles also believe they should cover their faces to be "proper" and they should not consider themselves raped unless 4 males witnessed it and are willing to testify to that. (of course - they would not have to testify as to WHY there was 4 of them and they did not stop it - that would be too liberal of an idea.....) If that is not the case - they should be thrown to jail for incest.... And of course if they bear a child because of the rape, that just proves it was NOT rape because they have those natural defense mechanisms that ensure they do not get pregnant unless they enjoy it.... After all - it was so ever since God created universe 6 thousand years ago, and that's how it should remain......

Kristin Beck, formerly Chris, served 20 years as a SEAL and fought on some of the most dangerous battlefields in the world, but after she left the service she realized she wasn't living the life she wanted. "Chris really wanted to be a girl and felt that she was a girl and consolidated that identity very early on in childhood," said Anne Speckhard, co-author of Beck's biography "Warrior Princess," which was published over the weekend. Speckhard told ABC News Beck suppressed that secret for decades, however, through the trials of SEAL training and the harrowing missions that followed, growing a burly beard as she fought on the front lines of American special operations. Brandon Webb, a former SEAL who served on a different SEAL team than Beck, said that Beck's reputation in the SEALs was a good one and said she was, by all appearances, the "consummate guy's guy."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1370368049729</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 13:47:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370368264593-29</Id><Topic><Title>PolitiFact says Republicans lie more</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1370360883942</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 11:48:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd ask you strip Bachman Santorum Perry or anyone else who spends great deals of air time talking about their personal relationship with God (so personal they share it with millions of viewers) of their semi-honorary status as Republicans, primarily because their broke the promise they made in the 1970's when we let them in by injecting their looniness into their politics.

So, guess what, the housing market is recovering, and with it the overall market will get better and better.</Msg><Username>sec_fordummies</Username><Timestamp>1370377782569</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:29:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370378057101-36</Id><Topic><Title>why are so many people so hateful and racist?</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370351341961</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 09:09:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's a new one - Cheerios is now considered "the Left" ????</Msg><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1370378057101</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:34:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370378131718-37</Id><Topic><Title>why are so many people so hateful and racist?</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370351341961</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 09:09:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"young republicans" - isn't that an oxymoron?</Msg><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1370378131718</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:35:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370378938439-38</Id><Topic><Title>why are so many people so hateful and racist?</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370351341961</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 09:09:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>crown, The Republican student movement is on the browl and very unhappy with the GOP.</Msg><Username>elksmember</Username><Timestamp>1370378938439</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 16:48:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370379303533-39</Id><Title>Bernanke… A Banker… Socialist…</Title><Msg>June 2, 2013, Princeton University: “ …the people who are the luckiest in their health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, encouragement, and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to enumerate–these are the folks who reap the largest rewards. The only way for even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered fair, is if those who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the world, and to share their luck with others.” And of course, as all hypocrites do, he quotes from Luke! These people who hate religion, who look at the poor with arrogance, they always like to show they “care”. They like quotes from Bible. Not too much. So G-d forbid people wouldn't think they have sympathy for religion. Well… Just another hypocrite in this government. BTW. Appointed by Bush. Wait until he screws up something and Bush gets the blame.

The girl had been born without a brain and Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez says she died five hours after Monday's operation. Officials refer to the 22-year-old mother only as Beatriz for privacy reasons. The country's Supreme Court last week prohibited an abortion for Beatriz, who suffers from lupus and kidney failure. Her lawyers said the pregnancy was threatening her life. Her plight drew international attention and a ruling from the Inter-American Court on Human Rights that El Salvador should protect her life and help her to end the pregnancy.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1370386552776</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 18:55:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370387194550-43</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P holds support twice at 1623</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1370375590411</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 15:53:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>**I have been spot on for years** You should start your own news letter....
