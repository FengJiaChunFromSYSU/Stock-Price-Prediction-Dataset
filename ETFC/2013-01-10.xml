Automatics (not just semi-automatics) are sold out! Some gun shops doubled the price and they are still all sold. Lots of pistols and bolt actions still to be had and clips with 20 or less bullets! (Most sold more last week then the whole last year - keep up the gun debate, it's good business) Glad I got my 2 SKS's still in oil paper shipped from Russia to a lawn mower repair shop which has a federal gun dealer license. Only paid $125 and $175 for the one with the chrome bayonet which is wall decoration - 50 clip. Took the "field grade" deer hunting - awesome - one shot and the buck fell! Got a black bear with my .454 mag. Casull, 5 shooter revolver. 7.5 inch barrel - Freedom Firearms, WY, custom made! The 250 grain half jacket, flat nose bullet stopped him flat in his tracks! Good hunting!

Discussion/Results so far: (Mayor Rybeck - MPLS) Last years 5 homocides here in Hennepin County were gang related and committed with hand guns, including 2 children shot in their homes by stray bullets, one was gang retaliation! Shooters invade a party and shoot to people with pistols - gang related - WRONG house/party!!! Male delivering a cake to disabled friend shot by gang members in alley - no reason giver - must have walked into a drug deal??? Downtown bar refuses under age male access to bar minor returns with hand gun and shoots two patrons! Neighborhood bar and restaurant expelled unruly customer (trouble maker), he returns and shoots (kills) bouncer with hand gun! Bloods from Chicago wowed revenge for top gang leader shot by police in MPLS! Officers are warned to be careful responding to suspicious 911 calls! 5+ shots fired on Penn - 911 no answer - called back 10 min. later - police will investigate dispatch?? Yesterday - Penn towards Lawrey Ave - 2 speeding cars, 1st car shoots out windows of chasing car - police pulled over 2nd car (they did not know why they got shot at and followed - right) - shooters get away car no found - why - afraid to follow the shooters???? St. Paul - yesterday - officer shot by 911 caller, partner saved by vest and kills shooter! Neighbor saw incident but couldn't help police - he did not own a weapon! Woman has seizure on city train - robber takes belongings displays pistol and gets away on next stop - nobody on board had a permit to stop robber! Husband shoots wife with pistol - dismembers her body in bath top - stores it in friends house without his knowledge - both ex cons, 13 year in prison friends, but friend reports him to police - I thought felons cant have a gun???? And on and on! Note: ALL crimes, 99% in both states were committed with non automatics or semi automatic long guns! Synopsis - we are focusing on the wrong subject - stop the gangs and the criminals and mentally "challenged" (to be political correct) and give more gun right to the law respecting citizens! Mass shooting with automatic long guns will be replaced with bombs/timers - then what, if we get those weapons off the streets??? We already had 3 bomb threats in schools this year!!!!

It seems to me that most off topic posts, posts containing banned words or phrases, or if you post to a thread that contains off topic, banned/political phrases. --- will be censored. Apparently there were enough people complaining about off topic posts that yahoo started running programs that eliminate most of that stuff leaving mostly only on topic posts on the boards. Like it or not that is what happened. It's funny to see you and skywanker bellyache and pound your heads off your keyboards about it though. What I've done is moved most of my political posting over to a political board. In the current climate that seemed to make the most sense. Over there posts don't get taken down, there are no banned words and the board is alive wif several threads having to do with politics and current events, you can hyperlink to news stories, post videos, music and more.. similar to how this board used to be before it got all censorhappy. I do come back to this board once in a while to see how etrade and how all the oldtimers are doing. But as far as posting anything of any length which takes time --is a waste of time since there's a good chance of it being gone within a few hours.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1357847085623</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 14:44:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357847354480-7</Id><Topic><Title>You will never guess who awarded father of the year...</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1357766157575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:15:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's the same idiot group who gave F of the Y to jingling johnny edwards in '08 LMAO!</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1357847354480</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 14:49:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357849012804-8</Id><Topic><Title>california_dem.........</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1357846910562</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 14:41:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.......shooter used a shotgun, NOW - BAN ALL Shotguns!!!

Of course, that's the way to go, BUT it will be for futures, not current recipients, so quit alarming the less knowledgeable! New guide lines will be, extending the age of eligibility because of longer life span of current paying in WORKING people maybe to age 67 for SS and I don't know if they will also move the partial amount set forth now by age 62??? This will apply most likely for WORKERS age 55 and below, so they have time to adjust/plan! Medicare might be "pushed out" (regulated) from age 65 by increasing the time to be eligible!

Al Gore is now 'richer than Romney' Someone finally has done all the math on the recent sale of Al Gore's Current TV to the Arabic language channel Al-Jazeera for $500 million. Jobs were lost, buzz created, employees angered, but the former vice president had little to say about it. He did walk away with a reported $100 million — a tidy sum for a man who had less that $2 million in assets when he ran for president more than a dozen years ago, says Forbes magazine. "Taking into account taxes to be paid on the deal, possible earlier debt and the fact that Gore's representatives declined to comment, Forbes conservatively estimates the former vice president's net worth to be at least $300 million, making him wealthier than unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney," says Ryan Mac, a Forbes analyst</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1357852951325</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 16:22:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357854304074-15</Id><Topic><Title>You will never guess who awarded father of the year...</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1357766157575</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-09 16:15:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Boy, I wished I could have gotten that title - BUT I couldn't find a willing Monica! :o( ROWDY</Msg><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1357854304074</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 16:45:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357854776915-16</Id><Topic><Title>Definition of a phoney liberal</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1357852951325</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 16:22:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh boy, does Tax King Obimbo know about this???
