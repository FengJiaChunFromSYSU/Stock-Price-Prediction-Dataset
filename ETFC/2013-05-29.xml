Bachmann knows she would be defeated, since her constituents are finally fed up with being represented by a crazy person whose only goal appears to be to make them the laughingstock of the nation. Her husband, the same husband who runs the Christian "pray the gay away" scam, is on the verge of being outed. The religious right is in complete disarray and Bachmann needs them. And some rightwing organization will provide her with a soft landing, so her comment about a full future will probably prove to be true. Personally, I hate to see her go.

Please, lets pick up on the instigators about to LEAVE OFFICE, like the head of the DOJ, the White House Chief of Staff, the head of the IRS (oops, got that one), and everyone else who falls under the category of this rule (Rule complements the White House Press Secretary, quote compliments the New York Times : The White House defended the decision to keep the president in the dark, with press secretary Jay Carney saying Obama was comfortable with the fact that "some matters are not appropriate to convey to him, and this is one of them." Well guess what, staffers aren't SUPPOSED to cherry pick which scandals the President gets to know about and to stage manage them behind the scenes without his knowledge, Presidents don't like that because it demonstrates without recourse to denial that his staff are using Presidential powers without the President knowing. Could you imagine the Principle of a High School saying "Just don't tell me about anything that might get anyone in trouble". Would that be acceptable? Was it acceptable when the Roman Catholic Church did it "There are certain things the Pope has told me are NOT appropriate to convey to him, and banging alter boys is one of them, unless of course I'm bringing him an alter boy to bang". Because switch the context and fill in the blanks and its significantly closer to the truth than what the Press Secretary said.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369855392817</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:23:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369855433391-25</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Dole tells FOX News: "Reagan would not make it today - GOP should close for repairs"</Title><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1369847506760</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:11:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And your point is?</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1369855433391</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:23:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369855459425-26</Id><Title>I was cured at Michele Bachmann's gay cure clinic</Title><Msg>I adore her.

This is like a freaking repeat of the Libs back during the Bush era, always wondering when the impeachment hearings were going to start because they didn't like him . . . Frankly it is NOT that easy to get impeached. Show us a crime, show us the evidence he was directly involved ( hearing about it in a meeting and saying "we'll fix it" rather than "you idiots, you're fired"), and then you can start crying for an impeachment. Wait until there's a Republican majority in the Senate though or your wasting your time. He could be banging Sasha in the East Wing in front of his wife and the Senate Majority Leader and the news wouldn't make it out the door.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369862041386</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 17:14:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369862234105-41</Id><Topic><Title>Our Prez and AG will still be in office long after the Nuts create another "scandal."</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1369849937146</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah I'm kinda worried that Our Pres intends to be in office LONG after the Nuts are gone . . .

However, the fake news publication – or "America's Finest News Source" – has sadly and stunningly announced that it will cease operations in 2014. In a press release, The Onion's Editor-In-Chief, Will Tracy, explained what led to the publication's difficult decision: The Onion has always been recognized as a first-rate satirical publication, making fun of all that is absurd in our socio-political world. However, in today's contemporary political environment, our brand has simply gotten muddled. And I can say with clarity that today's GOP is fully to blame. It used to be that political satire was easy. All one had to do was find the absurd buried beneath the surface of a given story and employ satire to highlight that absurdity. To shine a light on it. Now? Now you have headlines showing up in mainstream publications like "Kansas Republican Actually Opposes the Poor Buying More Food" and "Conservatives Less Likely to Buy Energy Efficient Bulbs if Labeled as Environmentally Friendly." The absurdity of conservatives in this country has completely destroyed our business. Republicans have ruined us. Period. New readers to The Onion can't tell anymore that we are a satirical publication. And established readers have been leaving our pages, finding greater absurdity at places like CNN and USA Today. snip// The Onion will continue operations through the upcoming presidential election, with its last issue set to be published on November 6, 2014. When asked why, Shebesta answered, "What better day for a satirical news outlet to close up shop?" Indeed."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1369865648663</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 18:14:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369868906996-46</Id><Topic><Title>Our Prez and AG will still be in office long after the Nuts create another "scandal."</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1369849937146</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 13:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fubar, You know exatly what I meant!
