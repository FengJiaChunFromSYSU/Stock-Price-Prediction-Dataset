The government gave PLENTY of warning for anyone who had a car or who could afford a bus ticket to leave the area or report to a designated shelter. Darwin says the stupid don't survive to pass on their gene, but I guess this guy's DNA will be culled further down the line. It is NOT the governments responsibility to do anything but prevent foreign attack. Technically they don't even have ANY law enforcement responsibilities save in the area of interstate or international crime. Of course they've assumed a great deal of power and leverage in recent years, but just because the government forms an agency to address a problem doesn't mean that it's a Constitutional duty that they address it, but that they may be doing it to "Promote the General Welfare" or social engineering via "the right to raise revenues for the operation of the government" by taxing particular things more heavily or create tons of paperwork to discourage certain behaviors, such as drinking, smoking, driving, competing with the government monopoly on awarding the business of maintaining the governments currency, building revenue positive businesses in areas the government has decided are too dangerous for little people, protecting us from poor people with guns by making obtaining and maintaining military quality weapons prohibitively expensive or an illegal act if done by someone without the money to afford such a weapon. Such weapons are now selling for 1000%+ over list because of their now forbidden status and there being few legal ones in possession and grandfathered at the time of the law, depending on the weapon. Yes, the Federal government has assumed more and more power over the last century, but they haven't assumed one BIT more responsibility. Think about THAT before you vote. What use is a government that creates dependent people but isn't a government the people can depend ON! People pay 20%+ of their income to a federal government in combined taxation almost no matter who they are, and all they get for it are the functions of a government that in 1850 had the same Responsibilities as it does now to its citizens, but many many MANY times the revenue and vastly more power. Any idea where this is going to be in another 40 years if we continue down this path? If our nation was a company I'd be short despite the great interest rates we're getting on our debt, because if interest rates shift after another 4 years of Obama spending, we're going to have to create a new one, and it's past time about thinking what we can learn from the mistakes of the last 150 years.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1352035987826</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 08:33:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352044697046-2</Id><Title>BO, FEMA, and Bloomberg - SANDY MISSION ACCOMPLISHED</Title><Msg>they said get back to work people of NY - Sandy's been gone for days. they wore those cool FEMA jackets and walked around just after the storm - glad handing and patting each other on the back. it would be funny if it weren't so offensive.</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1352044697046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 10:58:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352045250011-3</Id><Topic><Title>BO, FEMA, and Bloomberg - SANDY MISSION ACCOMPLISHED</Title><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1352044697046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 10:58:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then Dumbo went back to Bloomberg's Private Bath House in the West Village for an A.I.D.S.

More than 50 EPA staff are now crashing to finish greenhouse gas emission standards that would essentially ban all construction of new coal-fired power plants. Never before have so many EPA resources been devoted to a single regulation. The independent and non-partisan Manhattan Institute estimates that the EPA’s greenhouse gas coal regulation will cost the U.S. economy $700 billion. The rush is a major sign of panic by environmentalists inside the Obama administration. If Obama wins, the EPA would have another four full years to implement their anti-fossil fuel agenda. But if Romney wins, regulators will have a very narrow window to enact a select few costly regulations that would then be very hard for a President Romney to undo. Environmentalists at the EPA pulled this trick before in 2000 when the Clinton administration rushed out a finding that Mercury emissions from power plants were a growing public health threat pursuant to the Clean Air Act. That finding did not regulate power plants itself, but it did force the Bush administration to begin a lengthy regulatory process. The Obama EPA has estimated that this regulation alone will cost the U.S. economy $10.9 billion a year. Reached for comment, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said: President Obama won’t tell the voters of the Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania the truth about his plans to shut down the coal industry. Even after he loses on Tuesday, it appears that the President will still try to continue his efforts to kill their jobs and drive up their energy prices. Mitt Romney is committed to reversing the damage caused by the Obama Administration’s disastrous liberal agenda as soon as he takes office.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1352076948870</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 19:55:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352077083232-50</Id><Topic><Title>News Americans should know before they vote</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1352076948870</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 19:55:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Plus...Dumbo is STUPID !!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1352077083232</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 19:58:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
