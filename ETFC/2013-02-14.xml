Why doesn't he just push the Mexican border south until all the Northern Mexican states are within the US, grant citizenship to its residents, kill its narcoterrorists, and then be able to build a MUCH shorter border fence between what was Northern Mexico to somewhere in the central Mexican region . . . It's largely desolate anyway, and I'm sure all those Mexicans would LOVE becoming instant US citizens. In fact the only thing that might thwart his plan are all the southern Mexicans pitching in to help as well. He might be able to get the entire country of Mexico to surrender unconditionally without a shot being fired if he timed it right.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1360869048707</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:10:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360869550162-15</Id><Topic><Title>Heck of a call!!</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1360860032562</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:40:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My safe's contain little to no cash. Important documents, precious metals, and weapons are pretty much all I have room for. Besides, ITSTHTF paper currency and most coinage minted after 1964 is going to be worthless anyway, aside from bullion/commemorative coins with high silver or gold content. I've got a couple TINY gold pieces, quarter eagles I think they are. TINY things that make a dime seem imposing beside them, and no ridges on the edges (a bad design idea). They're in VERY good shape, a gift from my dad last time he was down. I think they have a $2.50 or $5 face value. Well, that was the American dollar when it was something other than a fiat currency, and we didn't have wild inflation, market speculation, and "bubbles" which could destroy the economy when they collapsed when things had to be paid for with hard specie. So, the one additional step after converting everything to cash . . . convert the cash to something more universally fungible and more compact. American dollars aren't going to be worth carrying around in a suitcase in another 20 years.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1360869550162</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 14:19:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360869812893-16</Id><Topic><Title>Nomination..........</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1360858239210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:10:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing to do with my math.

CNN Panel: Dorner's Alleged Murder Spree 'Exciting, Like 'Denzel Washington Movie' Panelists MC Lyte, Jack Moore, Editor of BuzzFeed Sports, Lauren Ashburn, Editor-in-chief at The Daily Download, and Mark Lamont Hill joined Brooke Baldwin on CNN today to talk about the social media support for alleged quadruple killer Christopher Dorner. Ashburn was the only one on the panel who had a problem with the alleged cop killer being celebrated saying that he crossed a line when he began killing people to get his revenge for his alleged grievences. The rest of the panel concluded that Dorner "had a point" and that the unfolding story was theatric. Hill said that the saga was "exciting," "like 'Django Unchained' in real life," and Dorner was similar to a "super hero." Moore said that it was like watching a "Denzel Washington movie" and that the social media support was just Internet "weirdness." Lyte concluded that because "children" were being killed by police brutality this event brought about a conversation that should occur. Baldwin agreed and said, "I'm glad we had this conversation".</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360877923649</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 16:38:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360878271290-23</Id><Topic><Title>Four Star Air Force General!</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1360858889936</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 11:21:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Please, show exactly what's larger than needed.
