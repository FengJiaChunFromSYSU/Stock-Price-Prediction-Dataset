And don't forget to repeal Obamacare for the 50th time, and to armchair rearview mirror hindsight prevent all Bush's 13 benghazis, and to finally show the proof that Obama is a mau mau anti-colonialist born in Kenya.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370225088408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 22:04:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370227164385-34</Id><Title>Prez Obama's Approval Ratings Unharmed By Controversies</Title><Msg>CNN Poll By Sean Sullivan, Published: May 19, 2013 at 1:07 pmE-mail the writer Even as his administration has faced intense scrutiny over a trio of controversies, President Obama’s approval rating hasn’t suffered, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll released Sunday. Fifty-three percent of Americans said they approve of the job the president is doing, while 45 percent said they disapprove. That’s virtually unchanged from an early April survey in which Obama’s approval/disapproval split was 51 percent to 47 percent. The poll is one of the earliest indicators of how Obama’s image has been affected during one of the worst weeks of his presidency. As questions about the deadly attack in Benghazi, Libya, revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted conservative groups, and news that the Justice Department secretly obtained journalists’ phone records have fueled Republican attacks, the president has been put very much on defense. More than seven in 10 Americans said the IRS actions were unacceptable; 55 percent said they believe the agency acted on it own, while 37 percent said it acted under the order of White House officials. The White House has said Obama did not learn of the episode until he read about it in news reports. The good news for Obama is that 61 percent said they believe that what the president said about the IRS matter is mostly or completely true. The good news for the GOP is that 54 percent said they think congressional Republicans are reacting appropriately to the episode. The CNN poll was conducted on Friday and Saturday. According to a Gallup poll released last week, interest in the IRS scandal and the controversy over Benghazi remains below average when it comes to major news stories. The findings mirrored a Pew Research Center survey which showed relatively few people are following the Benghazi episode. Rasmussin is the only poll who rated the Prez negatively.</Msg><Username>hunterspoint</Username><Timestamp>1370227164385</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 22:39:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370227178917-35</Id><Topic><Title>lame logic of pacifican &amp; others when confronted with the fact that a Bush appointee was running the IRS</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370208561810</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 17:29:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The fact is, the Bush appointee running the IRS had no idea what was going on. But you Blame his incompetence on Obama......... Tenet also had no idea what was going on, yet you approved of his incompetence and certainly never criticized bush for it..... and another fact is that LONG before the slam dunk quote , the Bush administration had decided to invade Iraq, so it didn't matter what tenet said. (Bush made the decision to invade, period.... and it was illegal and immoral even IF Iraq had wmd.... since the UN never authorized it, every bit of that was the decision of Bush). Do show where Obama made the decision to profile tea party applications for "social welfare" status.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370227178917</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 22:39:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370231645988-36</Id><Topic><Title>It's going to rain</Title><Username>egrp101800</Username><Timestamp>1370221999136</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 21:13:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This must be another of those Pub predictions they are so famous for. pacifican, rodent, bidder, gerbil, etc. don't you agree?
