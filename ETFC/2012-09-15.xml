As part of the false flag operation,[1] a group of Egyptian Jews were recruited by Israeli military intelligence for plans to plant bombs inside Egyptian, American and British-owned targets. The attacks were to be blamed on the Muslim Brotherhood, Egyptian Communists, "unspecified malcontents" or "local nationalists" with the aim of creating a climate of sufficient violence and instability to induce the British government to retain its occupying troops in Egypt's Suez Canal zone.[2] The operation caused no casualties, except for those members of the cell who committed suicide after being captured. The operation became known as the Lavon Affair after the Israeli defense minister Pinhas Lavon, who was forced to resign because of the incident, or euphemistically as the Unfortunate Affair or The Bad Business (Hebrew: עסק הביש‎, Esek HaBish). After Israel officially denied the incident for 51 years, the surviving agents were in 2005 officially honored with a certificate of appreciation by the Israeli President Moshe Katzav.[3] wiki and ntm Pollard..... they traded his stolen secrets to the Russians ....... then honored Pollard by making him a national hero and citizen.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347715574137</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:26:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347721794676-8</Id><Title>Scott Walker Gets Slammed By Judge !!!</Title><Msg>Repugnicans lose big time as Judge rules against their anti union legislation.</Msg><Username>drill_baby_drillllllll</Username><Timestamp>1347721794676</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 11:09:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347722249945-9</Id><Title>Romney Defines Middle Income as $250K</Title><Msg>Mitt Romney is promising to reduce taxes on middle-income Americans.

After Romney told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that his “red line” on Iran is that the Islamic Republic “may not have a nuclear weapon,” the host pointed out that his policy is the same as Obama’s. The GOP presidential nominee agreed: STEPHANOPOULOS: President Obama said exactly the same thing. He said it’s unacceptable for Iran to have a nuclear weapon. So your red line is the same as his. ROMNEY: Yeah, and I laid out what I would do to keep Iran from reaching that red line. [...] STEPHANOPOULOS: But your red line going forward is the same? ROMNEY: Yes. And recognize that when one says that it’s unacceptable to the United States of America that that means what it says. You’ll take any action necessary to prevent that development, which is Iran becoming nuclear. Watch the clip: Romney’s statement illustrates the confusion from Romney’s team on Iran, and indeed on the Romney camp’s wider foreign policy. (Romney’s foreign policy director would neither confirm nor deny that Romney is a neoconservative.) On one hand, the Romney campaign struggles to differentiate its Iran policy from President Obama’s, and on the other, his team sounds more like a neocon revival committee pushing for another war in the Middle East. The New York Times noticed this contradiction as well, reporting in an article on Friday that a senior foreign policy adviser to Romney said the former Massachusetts governor “would not be content with an Iran one screwdriver’s turn away from a nuclear weapon.” But, the Times added, the adviser “stopped short of saying exactly where, in the development of nuclear capability, Mr. Romney would draw the line.” President Obama has said that he won’t allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. The Obama administration is aware, not only of the threat an Iranian nuclear weapon poses, but also the potential negative consequences of a military attack on Iran, such as those outlined in a new bipartisan expert report released yesterday. And that, coupled with U.N., U.S. and Israeli assessments that Iran has not yet decided on whether to build a nuclear weapon, leads the administration to pursue a diplomatic solution with Iran, a track the it deems the “best and most permanent way” to solve the nuclear crisis.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1347726326559</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 12:25:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347726714300-13</Id><Topic><Title>our friends in the Mid East?</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347715574137</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:26:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>crown - paragraph one - hear hear! paragraph two - debatable....</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1347726714300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 12:31:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347727025323-14</Id><Topic><Title>Da Debt Bomb ...when will it go off? ...</Title><Username>legofthebear</Username><Timestamp>1306899888000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2011-05-31 23:44:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>billie, is that you billie-craniator? where in the heck was you?</Msg><Username>bami2012</Username><Timestamp>1347727025323</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 12:37:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347727191034-15</Id><Topic><Title>rightwing lunatics stirred up trouble just before the 2000 elections, too</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347715270798</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:21:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so those bacwards people will fight over a "Rock"? what won't they fight for? call it holy - and they'll drag you throught the streets. they are like human pit bulls. we'll need them on our side when aliens invade us</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1347727191034</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 12:39:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347727237225-16</Id><Title>tush limpbalz says Romney is a joke and a cartoon, but vote for him anyway</Title><Msg>Romney "may as well be Elmer Fudd as far as we’re concerned.

The military official emphasized that the US is apprehensive about the risk a strike against Iran could pose for American troops throughout the Persian Gulf. Separately, an Israeli official said Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak are trying to muster a majority in the cabinet in favor of military action against Iran.......... .........there is clearly an effort by Netanyahu and Barak to persuade the Americans to take the lead on military action, thereby facilitating broader support in the Israeli cabinet for action. Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces are engaged in preparations for the mission. This is should be dismaying to anyone of a sound mind. Note that the Russians have now publicly warned Israel of “unpredictable consequences” if Israel starts a war and Moscow means it. The Russians recently staged a joint military exercise with simulated an Iranian and Russian attack on the Caspian oil fields operated by American firms in reprisal for an attack by Israel on Iran. The exercise involved 12,000 forces and Moscow described the exercise as being of the “highest importance,” and said that the hypothetic scenario was all too likely. The Russians said that the Iranian offensive, which would use most of Iran’s air force had as its target the Kazakh oil field at Mangustan, operated by Exxon.

That was the larest institutional change in the Egyptian military following the Sinai war was they learned to do a rational post action review and make changes nto address shortcomings. Now they're filling up with the new militant Islamists that want absorbed after the revolution, and their professionalism is likely to go along with it. The less professional a military is the more likely it is for the military itself to advocate offensive war. This is something most officers will ONLY do if its obvious that the enemy eventually intends to take action anyway, and there is no reasonable defensive posture. Considering that Iran has been threatening to wipe Israel off the map for years, that they are close to having that capability, and that it would only take one good hit on Tel Aviv to wipe out most of the Israeli population, you have to admit they're taking a SERIOUS risk if they allow Iran to continue to run an unsupervised nuclear program. The ONLY reson to keep IAEA inspectors out is if you're developing things like HEU tampers for Pu-239 based fussion initiated fusion bombs. Once you can make a plutonium implosion device all you need is a way to suspend heavy hydrogen isotopes in a neutron bath and you have at least a two stage device. Add a reactor grade jacket as armor for the physics package inside and you have a three stager. Note that the HEU for the tamper need not need to be weapons grade at all, only enriched enough to enhance the "pump" of neutrons from the primary into the secondary fusion fuel, for this even the "medical" 20% Uranium they have currently would work fine. You get an even BETTER burn if you enhance your plutonium core with a good bit of tritium. though bombs "boosted" in this manner normally require periodic replacement of the tritium charge, this wouldn't be an issue if you only intended to build about two or three of them for one strike at Tel Aviv, along with every conventional missile as well to reduce the chance of Arrow intercepting ALL the WMD armed birds. The only thing I see the Iranians missing up to this point is the Plutonium. and the technology to put a three stage device together, and they could have purchased enough for a couple small cores from the black market. As for the technology, I feel confident I could build such a device given enough time and my exposure to nuclear physics is at an undergraduate level, I'm sure that given my expertise in computer science that writing a design emulator for thermonuclear weapons wouldn't be difficult if President Bush hadn't made it illegal to write such software. Of course Iranian computer scientists don't CARE what Bush made illegal, and since I know at least one of them, one of my former professors, is almost as good as I am, I have to assume they have that expertise as well.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1347733717258</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:28:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347734950606-26</Id><Title>Obama counting on post-convention bounce ----</Title><Msg>He bounces like a soft ball of brown play-doh</Msg><Username>schitdontbounce</Username><Timestamp>1347734950606</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 14:49:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347736190483-27</Id><Topic><Title>rightwing lunatics stirred up trouble just before the 2000 elections, too</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347715270798</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 09:21:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Europeans" built concentration camps?

(AP) — The shared belief that radical Islam threatens the world brought together an ex-convict, an insurance salesman and a Christian charity in production of a crudely crafted film that ridicules Muslims and the prophet Muhammad and has incited violent protests across the Middle East. Media for Christ, a nonprofit that raised more than $1 million last year “to glow Jesus’ light” to the world, was listed as the production company for the film. Steve Klein, a California insurance salesman and Vietnam War veteran who has spent years protesting at mosques and espousing hatred of radical Muslims, acted as the film’s promoter. And Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, who authorities say has used multiple names and was convicted of bank fraud, says he managed logistics for the film.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347739625097</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:07:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347740163210-32</Id><Topic><Title>nice work, rightwing neocon war mongering christians.</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347739625097</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:07:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>woof woof - bark bark - growl grown the human pit bulls</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1347740163210</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:16:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347740474301-33</Id><Topic><Title>nice work, rightwing neocon war mongering christians.</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347739625097</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:07:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so a "an ex-convict, an insurance salesman and a Christian charity" can set the middle east on fire? sounds pretty unstable over there......</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1347740474301</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 16:21:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347741463795-34</Id><Title>Bibi campaigning for Romney..... his beeatch</Title><Msg>"Opposition leader Shaul Mofaz (Kadima) blamed Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu for what he called the deteriorating relationship between the US and Israel, in a special meeting during the Knesset’s summer recess on Wednesday. “Mr. Prime Minister, tell me, who is our biggest enemy, the US or Iran? Who do you want replaced, [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad or [US President Barack] Obama?” Mofaz asked in the plenum. “How low are you prepared to drag relations with our closest ally?” According to the opposition leader, world leaders have not turned their backs to Israel, but they do not trust Netanyahu. " Jpost ------------------------------- msnbc Shaul Mofaz is a former chief of Staff of the IDF. He is of Iranian extraction. There was a remarkable discussion on Morning Joe today. This discussion was on the subject of Natanyahu's gross interference in the US presidential election and his attempts to control US foreign policy and armed forces operations. The Israeli/Likud side was represented by Donny Deutsch the vulgarian real estate mogul and Andrea Mitchell , notorious for her thinly concealed advocacy of Israeli positions.. The US side was represented by Lawrence O'Donnell and Joe Klein. O'Donnell and Klein made it clear that they believe that Natanyahu is making an open "play" to elect Romney who Natanyahu thinks is his #$%$" They also stated that Natanyahu seeks to control American foreign policy so that he can simply "order" US forces to attack Iran.

Average Gas Prices More Than Double Under Obama Average retail gasoline prices have more than doubled under President Obama, according to government statistics, rising from $1.84 per gallon to $3.85 per gallon. The average gasoline price is calculated by the Energy Information Agency, and shows that over the past 43 months of President Obama’s term retail gasoline prices have more than doubled, rising from an average of $1.84 per gallon to $3.85 per gallon. Rising gasoline prices were particularly prevalent in August, which saw a 9.0 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for gasoline, a rise that almost entirely accounts for the general increase in prices seen by families across the country over the past month.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1347743102099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:05:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347745192574-39</Id><Topic><Title>What is in your wallet</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1347743102099</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 17:05:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A $120 Million Lottery Ticket!...
