In a letter this week to the leaders, Heritage Action CEO Michael Needham says "outrage over Benghazi" and the IRS targeting of Tea Party groups has "rightly focused the nation's attention squarely on the actions of the Obama administration." The letter goes on to say the House must continue holding oversight hearings, "but it would be imprudent to do anything that shifts the focus from the Obama administration to the ideological differences within the House Republican Conference." The letter specifically mentions the Internet sales tax bill (which recently passed the Senate with lots of Republican support) and the farm bill (the Senate is working through it now and is likely to pass it soon). Needham says both bills, which House conservatives dislike, could prompt the press to write another " 'circular firing squad' article." "Rather than scheduling such legislation for consideration, we urge you to keep the attention focused squarely on the Obama administration," Needham wrote in summation."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368886521916</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 10:15:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368887099775-24</Id><Topic><Title>GOP advocates politics over country</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368886521916</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 10:15:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Real Patriotism is never on their agenda.

NBC News reports two agents have been disciplined for doing so, and the Justice Department announced a criminal probe. But so far no one has identified a single conservative group that was denied status in the controversial review, though some faced bureaucratic hurdles and had their tax-exempt status delayed. In fact, the only known 501(c)(4) applicant to have its status denied happens to be a progressive group: the Maine chapter of Emerge America, which trains Democratic women to run for office. Although the group did no electoral work, and didn’t participate in independent expenditure campaign activity either, its partisan status apparently disqualified it from being categorized as working for the “common good.” Ironically, the national organization and its earlier chapters had gotten tax-exempt status by the IRS during the Bush administration in 2006. But it appears as though the Maine group’s rejection triggered a review of the entire organization, and Emerge America and all of its chapters had their tax-exempt status revoked. Emerge reincorporated with 527 status, which requires it to report its donors. You can read the IRS letters explaining its decisions at the bottom of this post. Here’s what director Karen Middleton has to say: Emerge America and its initial state programs were granted 501(c)(4) status by the IRS several years ago. Later, when a new state program applied for the same status, it was denied because Emerge works only with women who are in the Democratic Party, so the IRS determined this did not meet the definition of “social welfare” for the common good. We believed this denial triggered a review of the Emerge programs that had already been granted c4 status, and consequently those statuses were revoked.

Some of the flagged groups did have their tax-exempt status delayed or did face some additional scrutiny, but not a single group has been denied tax-exempt status. A May 14 draft report by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration found that none of the 296 questionable applicants had been denied, “For the 296 potential political cases we reviewed, as of December 17, 2012, 108 applications had been approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicant, none had been denied, and 160 cases were open from 206 to 1,138 calendar days (some crossing two election cycles).” (p. 14) In fact, the only known 501(c)(4) applicant to recently have its status denied happens to be a progressive group: the Maine chapter of Emerge America, which trains Democratic women to run for office. Although the group did no electoral work, and didn’t participate in independent expenditure campaign activity either, its partisan nature disqualified it from being categorized as working for the “common good.” The Inspector General’s report found that in the “majority of cases, we agreed that the applications submitted included indications of significant political campaign intervention.” (p. 10). In fact, only 91 of the 296, roughly 31%, of the applications reviewed for the report did not have “indications of significant political campaign intervention.” In other words, more than two thirds of those flagged for processing by a team of specialists had those indications."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368893504816</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 12:11:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368896054736-28</Id><Topic><Title>Curious IRS brouhaha factoid</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368891049423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 11:30:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wrong, they were interviewing the director of one such organization in the Cincinnati area who STILL hasn't gotten his exemption.

A closer look by IREHR at the activities of some of the Tea Party groups that are currently under review or have received non-profit status from the IRS, reveals a difficult and dangerous situation. FirstCoast3The First Coast Tea Party Inc. of Jacksonville, Florida, for example, which applied for 501(c)(4) status in 2009 and received it in 2011. Commenting about the recent IRS controversy on Facebook, the group declared “We file a tax return, account for every penny.. We do not endorse candidates that is a no no.” Yet the group’s activities included public bragging about directly helping Republican campaigns. In an August 30, 2012 Facebook post, for instance, the group advertised a Jacksonville rally for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, adding, “bring your chairs and your signs, make sure they know that the First Coast Tea Party is and has been helping their campaign.” Three weeks later the group declared a “state of emergency” on Facebook, pleading with supporters to campaign for Romney, “FLORIDA FRIENDS, IF YOU LIVE IN ANY OF THESE 3 COUNTIES GET OFF THE COUCH NOW, GET YOUR FRIENDS OFF THE COUCH. GET TO THE REPUBLICAN HEADQUARTERS AND OFFER AND THEN DO SOME WORK. PHONES, (YOU CAN EVEN DO THESE CALLS FROM HOME) AND WALK AND KNOCK. NOW. WE CANNOT LOSE FLORIDA TO OBAMA.. NOW. THIS IS MOST CRITICAL.” [Emphasis in Original] These weren’t posts from some random supporter on the group’s Facebook page, they were posts from the official account of the organization."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368907256179</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 16:00:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368907781204-31</Id><Topic><Title>Curious IRS brouhaha factoid</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368891049423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 11:30:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AHh I understand, it's all PERFECTLY OK, afterall, why else would the ACTING head (hasn't been confirmed by the Senate) of the IRS been thrown to the wolves?

Jokes aside, the facts suggest a relatively well meaning misstep by the IRS . IRS is brutally understaffed due to GOP congressional denials of funds for additional agents needed to collect the unpaid taxes legitimately owed by Americans , estimated at $385 billion yearly in 2006. BTW-estimates are that every enforcement agent hired will return 8-10X his salary in legitimately owed taxes to the Treasury for those really worried about fairness and deficits. Citizens United triggered a bi-partisan, 4X increase in requests for tax exempt status. No secret that many political groups on both sides would attempt to portray themselves as apolitical to avoid taxes. Some harried IRS employees mistakenly decided to make their life easier by profiling groups with the blatantly political "tea party" in their names. Not illogical,examples exist it worked in many cases but CLEARLY wrong ethically. Those directly responsible should be canned , some already have been and more inquiries are being made. To date, no evidence I've seen indicates the policy was initiated by anyone in the White House. SCOTUS and the GOP congress are not guilt free here either.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1368911569053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 17:12:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368911961144-36</Id><Topic><Title>Curious IRS brouhaha factoid</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368891049423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 11:30:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Similarly, the Louisville Tea Party was granted 501(c)(4) status in 2009.

Then there’s the Katy Tea Party Patriots, which filed for 501(c)(4) non-profit status in 2009. This group actually ran an “Oust Obama 2012” campaign, organizing block-watching with the Fort Bend GOP, and phone-banking against Obama at GOP headquarters in Sugarland and Houston, Texas.

She urged members to vote for Gov. Romney. "Please take time to talk with friends and family you may have living out of state, and try to convince them to vote for Governor Romney, especially if you have friends and family in Florida, Colorado, or Ohio.

This regional California Tea Party group was granted the much more politically limiting IRS 501(c)(3) tax status back in 2009. It should be noted that this tax-status explicitly prohibits partisan political activity. According the IRS, “Under the Internal Revenue Code, all section 501(c)(3) organizations are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office. The prohibition applies to all campaigns including campaigns at the federal, state and local level. Violation of this prohibition may result in denial or revocation of tax-exempt status and the imposition of certain excise taxes.” Despite this (c)(3) designation, the group appears to have been involved in partisan political activity. Currently, the frontpage of the group's website features "upcoming events" instructing members to "Volunteer for Measure G," and "Volunteer for Vidak for Senate.” In the latter case, the website simply tells members, "Please volunteer to do phone banking or precinct walking to help win the election."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368912133074</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 17:22:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368912364123-40</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary-Dumbo Benghazi next round (I.R.S.

The group also appears to have engaged in openly political activity, including publicly endorsing candidates. On October 9, 2012, in a post on the group’s website “Are you ready to vote?” the group offered up an endorsement for Romney, “The choice is simple. Obama has stated, He will transform America and acted to do such. Everything this Administration stands for, is Government and control of every aspect of life. This is the pipe dream of a Socialist’s mentality, for in their eyes, you the individual, do not know and cannot do, what is right, so someone else has to make decisions for you, to ensure, you do not make the wrong choices or actions. Or you chose Romney, who does not want to transform America, the greatest nation in history of human kind. He wants to allow, the individual, to have the right, to succeed and fail on his own regard, while ensuring those freedoms, given by our Creator and to assure those inalienable rights, written about in the Declaration of Independence are retained by their proper owners, ‘We the People.’” These are but a few of the many examples of political intervention by Tea Party non-profits that IREHR has catalogued. There are many, many more. They’re not difficult to find. Rather than the so-called scandal cooked up by Tea Party groups, the real criticism of the IRS may be that it has let so many of these groups get away with what are apparently egregious violations. After the firing of several high level IRS employees over this incident, how likely is it that Tea Party groups will be prevented these sorts of violations in the future?"</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368912411556</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 17:26:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368912912877-42</Id><Topic><Title>Curious IRS brouhaha factoid</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368891049423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 11:30:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You clearly did not watch the I.R.S.

E. Cupp and New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin discussed the obstructionist Republican Congress and its mission to take down the president by taking down the country. Moore opined that the Republican Party is a “squealing dinosaur” whose time has come. Maher began the segment by talking about how prices among top health insurers are falling since the implementation of Obamacare. “They did a test and they put, you know, what insurance would cost if you were a 40-year-old, non-smoker and instantly, the two highest priced insurers went down,” Maher said. “This is the heart of Obama,” he said. “This is the heart of capitalism. I’m wondering why the people who love the free market so much are not for this.” “And what about trying to repeal it for the 37th time?” he went on. “Is that a wise use of our time and resources? At some point, obstruction becomes, um, I dunno, treason.” He went on to list how Republicans are blocking the nominations of a new head for the EPA, a chief circuit court judge for the city of Washington, D.C. and dozens of other government posts that are going unfilled because Republicans won’t let any of Obama’s nominees get voted on in Congress. “At some point,” Maher said, “it becomes more about hating him than loving our country.” “No, they hate America,” said Moore. “I think that’s really what it is.” He went on to say that “conservatives and right-wingers,” as much as they profess to love this country, “they hate it. They hate the government, they hate the people.” He went on to say, however, to Maher, “I’m not as depressed about this as you are.” Young people, he said, are retreating from the Republican Party and abandoning its principles as outdated and overly moralistic. Young people today, he said, “they’re not bigots, they’re not haters.” The Republican Party is a “squealing dinosaur” .</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1368934708633</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 23:38:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
