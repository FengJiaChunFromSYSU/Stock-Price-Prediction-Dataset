"It's to say, hey, this isn't okay. We have stepped over the line," said state Rep. Kathy Hawken (R-Fargo) in a phone interview with The Huffington Post. "One of the key tenets of the Republican Party is personal responsibility. I'm personally pro-life, but I vote pro-choice, because you can't make that decision for anyone else. You just can't." North Dakota recently passed the most restrictive abortion ban in the nation, which prohibits abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, and a bill preventing pregnant women from choosing abortion based on a fetal anomaly or genetic disorder. The state also has a "trigger ban," which would prohibit abortion entirely if Roe v. Wade were to be overturned. Lawmakers are currently considering two "fetal personhood" measures that would effectively ban abortion in the state and complicate the legality of birth control, stem cell research and in vitro fertilization. Hawken said the personhood bills are so extreme that she and approximately 10 of her Republican colleagues in the state legislature -- both men and women -- were inspired to speak out in defense of women's rights. "North Dakota hasn't even passed a primary seatbelt law, but we have the most invasive attack on womens health anywhere," she said. "I got a letter yesterday from a pharmacist who said, 'We don't want to be in jail because we prescribed something!' We're spending an inordinate amount of time on social or personal issues, however you want to put it, but we haven't done anything on property tax relief, higher education funding, fixing the roads. There are all kinds of other things we need to be doing besides this."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363925114998</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 00:05:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363951303295-2</Id><Topic><Title>Gay Penguins Become Dads</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363877013067</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 10:43:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WOW!

USA is "broke" per Boehner and the gop 2. their illegal occupation is in violation of UN resolutions and international law 3.they are no friends of the USA as Pollards espionage and their attacks on us have proven, for instance: On June 8, 1967, US Navy intelligence ship USS Liberty was suddenly and brutally attacked on the high seas in international waters by the air and naval forces of Israel. The Israeli forces attacked with full knowledge that this was an American ship and lied about it. Survivors have been forbidden for 40 years to tell their story under oath to the American public. The USS Liberty Memorial web site tells their story and is dedicated to the memory of the 34 brave men who died. The Attack After surveilling USS Liberty for more than nine hours with almost hourly aircraft overflights and radar tracking, the air and naval forces of Israel attacked our ship in international waters without warning. USS Liberty was identified as a US naval ship by Israeli reconnaissance aircraft nine hours before the attack and continuously tracked by Israeli radar and aircraft thereafter. Sailing in international waters at less than five knots, with no offensive armament, our ship was not a military threat to anyone. The Israeli forces attacked without warning and without attempting to contact us. Thirty four Americans were killed in the attack and another 174 were wounded. The ship, a $40-million dollar state-of-the-art signals intelligence platform, was later declared unsalvageable and sold for scrap.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1363959505246</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 09:38:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363959734348-5</Id><Topic><Title>A Message to Bush and Cheney From a Dying Veteran</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363921041425</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 22:57:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry for your situation.

Germany and Japan destroyed many more US military vessels in the past, yet they are our best allies. Bringing here 55 years old episode for which Israel profusely apologized is only a proof your case against Israel is thinner than air on Mt. Everest. We didn't have president who dislikes Israel that much for a looooong time. Don't worry, he is doing his best for his Muslim brothers against Jewish state.

Police Departments Beg And Barter For Ammo While DHS Buys Up 1.6 Billion Rounds In Past Year The nationwide shortage of ammunition has left many police departments scrambling to get their hands on the necessary rounds - with some even bartering among each other. Meanwhile, Rep. Timothy Huelskamp (R-Kansas) says the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has failed to respond to multiple members of Congress asking why DHS bought more than 1.6 billion rounds in the past year. Police Chief Cameron Arthur of Jenks, Oklahoma says, "Ammunition and assault weapons in general have skyrocketed...In addition to the fact, not only is it a lot more expensive, but the time to get it could be six months to a year, or in some cases even longer." Arthur says he is waiting on an order placed last October and that many departments have begun to trade and barter with each other because of the high demand. "Most police departments are having a very difficult time even getting the necessary ammunition for handguns, shotguns and especially rifles," Arthur said.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363980434935</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 15:27:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363981588148-23</Id><Topic><Title>Netanyahu begs USA to Free Pollard, the spy and traitor</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1363957059042</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 08:57:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>US provides financial aid to Egypt, Pakistan and Israel.

Bush administration** The White House has been lowering expectations for Obama's trip to Israel all this week. If Israelis don't like Obama, Palestinians are even less favorable. Obama has to assure Israelis and Palestinians that he is still engaged. President Obama's first journey to Israel as president comes amid earth-shattering change in Middle East, much of it for the worse. The Arab Spring, which once raised hopes of freedom and dignity, has diverged onto the dark path of Islamist authoritarian rule. In Syria, tens of thousands of people have died in a bitter civil war that might have recently seen its first use of chemical weapons. And Iran continues its march toward nuclear weapons capability, heedless of international condemnation. Obama's effort to seek peace between Palestinians and Israelis is in tatters. That's why the White House has been lowering expectations for Obama's trip to Israel all this week. He will announce no new peace plan, grand design or major foreign policy initiative. His advisers are calling the trip a "listening tour."
