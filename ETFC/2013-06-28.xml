What actually happened is this: House Republicans passed a twisted account of a hearing to ABC's Jonathan Karl, who misleadingly claimed to have seen it, creating the impression that the administration was caught in a major lie. Then the IRS story broke, which we now see was Republicans demanding a one-sided audit and thus producing the impression of one-sided treatment. In that context, legitimate controversies over Obama's civil-rights policies became the "three Obama scandals," exposing a government panopticon, if not a Nixonian administration bent on revenge. The collapse of the Benghazi story happened very quickly.... But the scandal cloud lingered through the still-extant IRS scandal, which in turn lent the scandal odor to the civil-liberties dispute. Now that the IRS scandal has turned into a Darrell Issa scandal, we're left with ... an important dispute over domestic surveillance, which has nothing to do with scandal at all. The entire scandal narrative was an illusion.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1372430984273</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:49:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372431391057-4</Id><Title>LLF is receding into the shadows</Title><Msg>where he likes it. wonder if he's applying some of his exit based strategies to extract a few more pennies from his rape victim.</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1372431391057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:56:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372433663970-5</Id><Title>Where's Benghazi ?</Title><Msg>Was it all just another phoney right wing trumped up lie ?

Hank Johnson (D-Ga.) said Wednesday that the fact that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas voted this week to gut the Voting Rights Act -- the 1965 law aimed at protecting disenfranchised voters -- ranks him somewhere below the likes of Edward Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified information about U.S. surveillance programs to the press. "Comparing it to Snowden, I'd say the offense is worse," Johnson told The Huffington Post. Johnson, who is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Snowden was wrong to leak top-secret materials to the media but was also "mistaken" in thinking that NSA's activities were illegal. By contrast, Thomas, who is black, is "legally aware of the consequences" to the black community of striking down a core piece of the Voting Rights Act, Johnson said, yet he did it anyway. Members of the CBC are among those outraged by the Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling in the case. Several gave speeches on the House floor on Thursday to express their disapproval and to urge Congress to take action to restore the law. Civil rights hero and longtime congressman John Lewis (D-Ga.) said Wednesday that the court "put a dagger in the heart of the Voting Rights Act." Johnson said caucus members have gotten used to Thomas casting conservative votes that may be harmful to the black community. "We don't waste time sitting around talking about Clarence Thomas," he said. "Everybody knows it's a deep tragedy."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1372434301742</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 11:45:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372435213877-8</Id><Topic><Title>LLF is receding into the shadows</Title><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1372431391057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 10:56:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>KG gave up effective control of ETFC in 2009.

Companies that make money on their subsidies while selling their products at a loss will have to compete in the real world, and many government contractors will have excess capacity for things that almost no one but government wastes money on, or would WANT to waste money on. Which ones? No, freaking, clue, but lets get a list of how many energy companies are effectively wholly reliant on "green" energy grants and filter them for publicly traded companies, that should give someone a "who to short list" for 2016.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1372461695608</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-28 19:21:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
