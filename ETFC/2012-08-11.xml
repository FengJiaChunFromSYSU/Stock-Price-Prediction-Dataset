Early voting stations in Ohio’s heavily Democratic counties will only be open between 8 am and 5 pm, while Republican counties have expanded their hours to allow voting on nights and weekends. This rule is the latest in a broader attack on voting rights in Ohio, which often comes down to a tiny margin of votes. Ohio Republicans are currently ensconced in a legal battle with the Obama campaign over another new rule that would limit early voting in the three day period before the election exclusively to military families. Mitt Romney falsely claims Obama’s lawsuit is meant to take away voting rights from military families, when in fact he is simply trying to restore voting rights to all Ohio residents. Early voting was introduced to mitigate Ohio’s notoriously chaotic elections, in which thousands of votes are tossed due to clerical errors and bureaucratic confusion. Starting October 1st, voters in Democrat-leaning urban centers including Cleveland, Columbus, Akron and Toledo will now only be allowed to vote between 8 am and 5 pm on weekdays, when the majority of people are at work. The board of elections in these counties, which are split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, was gridlocked over a Democratic effort to expand hours. The Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted stepped in to deny expanded hours in these counties. But Republican-heavy counties have actually expanded early voting hours on nights and weekends, when most people have time to go to the polls.</Msg><Username>topgun_0476</Username><Timestamp>1344658746000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 00:19:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344658818000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal intolerance of religion, esp Mormonism.</Title><Username>project2069</Username><Timestamp>1344564209000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 22:03:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;&lt;global warming" and "climate change" are the latest religions&gt;&gt; Science is not a religion.

Following his studies, Ryan briefly returned to Wisconsin and worked as a marketing consultant for a construction company run by his relatives.[13][20] Concerned that her son "was destined to become a ski bum", Betty Ryan reportedly nudged him to accept a congressional position as a staff economist attached to Kasten's office, which he did after graduating in 1992.[19][21] In his early years working on Capitol Hill in D.C., Ryan supplemented his income by working as a waiter and fitness trainer and at other various side jobs.[22]"</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344700566000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 11:56:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344700992000-44</Id><Title>Let the cleansing begin</Title><Msg>http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/08/the-paul-ryan-wikipedia-edits-begin-131718.html</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344700992000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 12:03:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344701188000-45</Id><Topic><Title>chart analysis</Title><Username>lowellfnc972</Username><Timestamp>1344696151000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 10:42:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting</Msg><Username>osmondyln539</Username><Timestamp>1344701188000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 12:06:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344701316000-46</Id><Title>From the mouth of a conservative</Title><Msg>It "Will Draw Blood" - GOP thinker David Frum describes perfect attack ad against Ryan By John Aravosis on 8/11/2012 09:51:00 AM Frum is an interesting character.

"We are in a bull market," he said. "The mistake investors have made is too much attention on global risk, and not enough attention on fundamentals that are very resilient." Cote believes that record high aggregate earnings for S&amp;P 500 companies this year and signs of improvement in the labor market mean investors should be taking on more risk rather than fretting about the dangers stemming from Europe's debt crisis. __ ETFC will advance into $9 next week!!</Msg><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1344703031000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 12:37:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344703216000-53</Id><Topic><Title>Big Jump on Monday!!!

He said Romney “ought to square with the American people and release his taxes like any other candidate.” Huntsman, father of Romney’s primary rival Jon Huntsman Jr., served as Romney’s 2008 finance chair. Some speculated that he might be the source for Harry Reid’s unsubstantiated claim that Romney paid no taxes for 10 years, based on the Utah billionaire’s past close relationship with Romney and his son’s more recent antagonistic one. Huntsman, while echoing Reid’s call for Romney to release his returns, denied to the Post that he was the source, calling the allegation “absolutely false.” Like Reid, Huntsman noted that Romney’s own father, George Romney, started the modern tradition of releasing tax returns for presidential candidates.</Msg><Username>fritzinacrotchlesstutu</Username><Timestamp>1344705410000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 13:16:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344706222000-61</Id><Title>W won't be at the convention?</Title><Msg>and Mittens never mentions him? why isn't the gop proud of their work with Bush?

The American Civil Liberties Union and League of United Latin American Citizens have filed for an injunction, calling the rules illegal. By some secret means known only to it, Schultz's office can now, based on rules only it has vetted, determine whether someone ineligible, say a non-citizen, has registered. The office is sending letters to these voters which say they have 14 days to dispute the state's claim and prove they are eligible to vote or face removal from the state list. And possible prosecution. At this time of year especially, such voters could simply be on vacation. The second rule allows anyone to claim voter fraud without swearing to their accuracy. That, says Ben Stone, the chief of the ACLU-Iowa, is against state law. But that apparently makes no never mind to Schultz. Schultz has also brought in an agent from the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation to look into voter fraud. County auditors, who run local elections, were surprised and some quite taken aback by the announcement. And not just Democrats. For instance, Ken Kline, a Republican auditor in Cerro Gordo County, said he had many questions about what the DCI agent will look at since many cases are simply data errors. "I wish we had better communication as to what databases were compared, what were the procedures, what were the parameters, the controls," he said. "We do a lot of that in this office and you have to be very careful, especially with something of this volatile of a nature."</Msg><Username>topgun_0476</Username><Timestamp>1344717969000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 16:46:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344719515000-83</Id><Topic><Title>Trump is whacko</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1338351461000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-05-30 00:17:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thu Aug 09, 2012 at 06:30 PM PDT The Chronicles of Mitt: Aug 9, 2012 by Hunter pen on paper: 'Dear diary' Hello, human diary. It is I again, Mitt Romney, your better. Outrage over my press secretary's suggestion that a law I once passed may have been of benefit to sick people continues to grow. We are receiving condemnations from all quarters. I have been told that a Fox News guest was so agitated over the gaffe that they nearly died, right there in the studio. I am not entirely sure what is going on, but none of these people seemed to know about my Massachusetts law until the moment my press unit mentioned it, even though I personally quite clearly remember it coming up repeatedly before. Or, perhaps, they just did not realize that the law might have provided actual assistance to someone? By and large these are very stupid people, so it is sometimes difficult to ascertain what they are going on about. Regardless, we have still not decided how to respond to these accusations that I once tried to provide help to sick people. Our latest idea for quelling party outrage is to promise to introduce a bill allowing all sick people to be immediately fired, thus combining the required cruelty towards sick people with the uproariousness of firing people. The idea has promise, but my staff believes such a bill has already been introduced, possibly by Rand Paul(?), and that it therefore may not be original enough. In more positive news, my foreign policy training has continued apace. With the help of that Bolton fellow I am now able to inject insults towards other nations into nearly any given conversation. He may be an exceedingly odd person, but I continue to be impressed by his encyclopedic knowledge as to how the various other nations of the world should best be ridiculed.</Msg><Username>spenditol98_1</Username><Timestamp>1344719515000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 17:11:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344721582000-84</Id><Topic><Title>GOP leaders want to see tax returns</Title><Username>fritzinacrotchlesstutu</Username><Timestamp>1344646227000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-10 20:50:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gov.

What you actually get wif the Ryan pick is a more energized conservative base. Polls already show pubs are more energized this time around than are the dems. Brak's problem in this election is a disappointed base of homercrats that are unmotivated. Take a look at your blacks. You think they'll come out in the numbers they did in '08? Even if they do how many will the pubs peel off due to Brak's failed policy, lies and an economy in shambles? OK, same goes for the Hispanics and younger voters -- all are less enthused and more inclined (if they do vote) to cast it in favor of moving the country in a different direction.

Or we could continue to allow the current President to fix the problems conservatives have created over the past 30 years by pursuing policies that strengthen the middle class and working poor such as by providing affordable health care, by requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share, by standing by the values that made this country great and exporting those values to other nations to strengthen our national defense without the need to put our young in harms way.

He's wrong to believe that today's economic problems are caused by fears of tomorrow's debts. Ryan's plan implies a promise that we can create jobs in 2013 by restraining Medicare costs after 2023. That's ideology talking, not economics. He's wrong to say that the US faces an imminent debt crisis. Today's big deficits are the consequence, not the cause, of the weak economy. He's wrong to treat the Medicare cost problem in isolation from other aspects of the healthcare cost problem. You can't force healthcare costs down generally by dealing with Medicare alone. And if you do deal with Medicare alone, you risk stranding seniors with inadequate resources as healthcare inflation continues to rage. He's wrong to bet the house on premium support without any certainty that it will work. We should test whether this idea will deliver as promised. (Calling Jim Manzi, author of the new book about the need for public-policy testing, Uncontrolled!) Above all: Paul Ryan is wrong, wrong, wrong to imagine that a society can deal with rising social-insurance costs while entirely exempting Republican-voting age cohorts and without asking for anything from its richest people—in fact while simultaneously delivering those people a huge tax cut. Medicare reform will mean large sacrifices for younger and poorer Americans, exactly the people who have lost most in this recession and the slow-growth years before the recession. A president cannot ask that generation to bear all the remaining burden of sacrifice alone. You can't lead the battle for deficit reduction from the rear. Yet that is exactly the proposition embedded in the Ryan plan. That's bad politics—and worse governance."

Mittens has lost the Independents, because he picked this clown to be his VP. Ryan wants to eventually privatize Social Security and he would fail just like GWB. Ryan's outlandish budget plan would increase the age to receive SS to 70 - good luck with that one. This clown's voucher system would make healthcare extremely expensive and private insurance rates will be out of reach for many Americans.

Under the Ryan budget plan anticipated cuts in Social Security, Medicare, Medicate, higher private insurance rates, cuts in education, but increases in defense spending would occur. The majority of Americans will not let this happen. The American majority is more than energized - it is "ANGRY" with the GOP, Teaparty, and clowns such as Mittens and the kid. How old is Ryan? 42 years old. He hasn't had any life experience yet. Btw, has Ryan volunteered for our military?

Within minutes of tapping Paul Ryan as his vice presidential nominee, presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney was distancing himself from the congressman's controversial budget, which includes steep cuts to government programs and changing Medicare into a voucher-like program. The Romney campaign sent out talking points on Saturday that made the case that he was his own man on matters of Medicare and Social Security and that he wouldn't be tied to a document he insisted he'd sign into law and once called "marvelous." The main talking points are below: Questions and Answers About The Romney/Ryan Ticket: 1) Does this mean Mitt Romney is adopting the Paul Ryan plan? · Gov. Romney applauds Paul Ryan for going in the right direction with his budget, and as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance. · Romney's administration will go through the budget line by line and ask two questions: Can we afford it? And, if not, should we borrow money from China to pay for it? · Mitt Romney will start with the easiest cut of all: Obamacare, a trillion-dollar entitlement we don't want and can't afford. · Mitt Romney also laid out commonsense reforms that will make good on our promises to today's seniors and save Social Security and Medicare for future generations. 2) Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have different views on some policy areas -- like Medicare spending, entitlement reform, labor, etc. -- do you think those differences are going to hurt or help? · Of course they aren't going to have the same view on every issue. But they both share the view that this election is a choice about two fundamentally different paths for this country. President Obama has taken America down a path of debt and decline. Romney and Ryan believe in a path for America that leads to more jobs, less debt and smaller government. So, while you might find an issue or two where they might not agree, they are in complete agreement on the direction that they want to lead America</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344742285000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 23:31:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>32</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344742320000-108</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan plan already abandoned</Title><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344742285000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 23:31:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Distancing himself from the Ryan budget may be an act of political necessity for Romney, as the proposals -- mainly those for entitlement programs -- have proven unpopular in various congressional district races and public opinion polls. But it won't be easy, as Romney is on record praising the Ryan budget on multiple occasions. "I think it'd be marvelous if the Senate were to pick up Paul Ryan's budget and to adopt it and pass it along to the president," he said this March. Elsewhere, he added: "I spent a good deal of time with Congressman Ryan. When his plan came out, I applauded it as an important step," he said. "We're going to have to make changes like the ones Paul Ryan proposed." In a Fox News Sunday interview in December 2011, meanwhile, Romney was asked about the Ryan budget as if it were his own plan and responded by arguing the merits of Ryan's approach. And as pointed out by the Obama campaign, Romney said in an interview with a Milwaukee radio station in March 2012 that he and Ryan had been working "over the last several months" in collaboration on plans "for a tax policy and spending, as well as Medicare reform." Ryan's "proposals and the ones I’ve outlined in my campaign are very much on the same page," Romney added. Ryan, for his part, seemed to agree, telling CBS in March that Romney would enact the major parts of his budget as president. "I'm not expecting everybody to enact every little piece of this," Ryan said. "But, yes, he -- and the other candidates running for president -- have embraced these kinds of reforms because we know it's the best way to save and strengthen the Medicare guarantee, save Medicaid."</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344742320000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 23:32:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>32</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
