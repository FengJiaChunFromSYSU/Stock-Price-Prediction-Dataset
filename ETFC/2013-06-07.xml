So you Log Cabin Pubes can breath easier today. A trio of Iowa-based religious scholars penned an op-ed in a local paper this week, reminding readers that despite popular opinion, the Bible does not simply define marriage as between one man and one woman. Ultimately, said Cargill, a Biblical "argument against same-sex marriage is wholly unsustainable. We all know this, but very few scholars are talking about it, because they don't want to take the heat." So I guess now you maroons can only quote Rush, and not the bible.</Msg><Username>anotherwingnutloser</Username><Timestamp>1370623034954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 12:37:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370626114807-10</Id><Topic><Title>Turn off your Verizon phone if you are having an affair</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1370546509395</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 15:21:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Still drinking the Obama Koolaid?"
