They altered course but they didn't interfere with the positioning (e.g. they didn't re-designate a long term patrol area when it was halfway to another one) and wouldn't save for military reasons. As far as altering course so a banner streams the right way goes, no biggy, CVBG's have to alter course every time they launch or recover aircraft to get wind advantage, it's part of their nature.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358522480956</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:21:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358523901071-3</Id><Title>Great choice for CEO!</Title><Msg>Finally we can anticipate the stock trading in the $20s again.</Msg><Username>lego_architect</Username><Timestamp>1358523901071</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 10:45:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358533197783-4</Id><Topic><Title>If helocs are E's biggest problem...</Title><Username>ohioracketeer</Username><Timestamp>1358531761778</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:56:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1.7 Billion of HELOCS are in excess of 120% LTV, right now.

I don't think it'll be an asset dumping as much as an asset realization structure. Asset dumping is something you do only when your rear is on the line, and eTrade is in no where near that bad a condition. Some of their assets are not great, but I'm sure when they get around to unrolling all that paperwork they'll find out they picked up some gems in the pile as well. As long as they were smart enough to buy securities represented INTACT mortgages as opposed to shares of a pool of mortgages this shouldn't be too much of a problem. If they invested in mortgage pools that money would take forever to unwind anyway, so might as well hold it, or give it up to someone with a longer few for a couple dimes on the dollar.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358536323910</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 14:12:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358537103384-6</Id><Title>E*Trade earnings 1/24</Title><Msg>You wonder if the value invstors have run out of ideas and are now searching in the dregs.

Obama Jobs Council hits 1 year without official meeting President Barack Obama's Jobs Council hit a notable milestone on Thursday: one year without an official meeting. The 26-member panel is also set to expire at the end of the month, unless Obama extends its tenure. The group, formally known as the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, last convened on Jan. 17, 2012 for a White House session where it presented formal recommendations to Obama. It was the panel's fourth official meeting since it was created in early 2011. (PHOTOS: 39 photos from Obama’s first term) A spokesman for Jobs Council chairman Jeffrey Immelt, who's the CEO of General Electric, referred questions about the panel's future to the White House. A White House spokeswoman had no comment Thursday.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358542302696</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 15:51:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358542332450-13</Id><Title>About time</Title><Msg>Next resistance 10.21.

Nawww, I'm a wuss, it's too darn cold outside to shoot targets, and I don't feel like hunting for meat given what little is left in season. Don't even think I got tags this year. I know I didn't get a chance to go hunting. Seems like I spend more time now dealing with government bureaucracies anymore than having fun. Fortunately for me I soon won't be lonely in that if Obama care really will be "like the VA". I imagine I'll spend my holiday trying to find out how long it's actually going to take those #$%$ to 1. Fix my current chair 2. Find me a backup chair 3. Fix the screwed up autotiedown in my Van SO MAYBE I can get out of the house again. All that damage from ONE trip to Vegas and back. And what's worse is I lost money.

In Washington on Wednesday, as you rolled out a slate of gun control measures quickly cobbled together in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, you said, “If there is even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there is even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try.” If you believe those words, Mr. President, here is a heartfelt suggestion: Come back to your adopted hometown and personally host a summit that grapples seriously with the causes of -- and crafts meaningful solutions to -- gang violence in America’s big cities The sad reality is that while terrible mass shootings like the ones at Aurora and Newtown shock the nation’s conscience, pull at the public’s heartstrings, and garner wall-to-wall media coverage, they represent a tiny fraction of the number of gun homicides in the country every year. It’s really not much of an exaggeration to say that parts of Chicago resemble a war zone. The numbers are grim. Unofficially, there were 513 homicides in Chicago in 2012, nearly 100 more than New York City, which recorded 414 killings but which has a population three times larger. Chicago’s body count is 200 more than the number of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan last year. The carnage has continued unabated into the New Year. It’s gone on too long, sir.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358550463045</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 18:07:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message></Date>
