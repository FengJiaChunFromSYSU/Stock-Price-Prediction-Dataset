E*Trade Financial announced further progress deleveraging the balance sheet ... MKM Partners raised the price target on the broker to $13.50 from $11.

( Per Princess Obimpolosi) I scheduled my 2013 Complete Physical last Monday by phone (need a finger operation - use it as a Pre-Op) and as being a patient since 1986 with the same hospital/doctor, I got a "new experience"! After the pull up of my patient records, the scheduler asked something I never got asked before! 1. Are you a US citizen? - Yes 2. Are you Hispanic or Asian? - No 3. Where were you born? - Germany 4. What race are you? - White 5. Do you have insurance? - Yes 6. With whom and what policy? - Medica Prime, Enhenced 6. Do you have a credit card? - Yes 7. When would you like to come in? - Tomorrow 8. Would 11:00 AM be OK? - Perfect 9. You are all set, bring your Insurance Card, Credit Card and a Picture ID!!! I never got asked about my Medicare Card??? I know this MC does NOT take Medicaide or Badgercare! Tuesday: There was an older couple and they were totally confused and said that "we have never been asked that all our life and we are on Medicare"? I told them - Obimbo Care!!!! (The good news, I was in before I even started the paper work and did that between X-ray and blood works, ZERO minorities, no screaming kids and great service!!!)
