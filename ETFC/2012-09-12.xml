The Republican challenger to President Barack Obama has branded Russia the “No. 1 geopolitical foe” of the United States. Putin said in remarks carried by Russian news wires that Romney’s statement has “strengthened Russia’s positions in talks on this important and sensitive subject,” but added that he would work with Romney if he’s elected.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347423011852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 00:10:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347432292867-2</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot already screwing up U.S. foreign policy.</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347423011852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 00:10:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, what did Obama do to arabs that they start burning US flags and start killing US workers?

So what is your beef? what kind of message does the gop send school kids by blasting teachers as greedy , incompetent losers who don't deserve a basic middle class salary? and fyi like about any occupation there are maybe 10% who don't care and are incompetent, so why do you attack everyone for a few...... you could say the same for military officers, say an 03 chaplain who at mid career would make about $100K in salary and housing, plus get 75% pay and good medical for life after 30 years. Since you know what people are worth, is that worth it. Heck, a good number of the officers and senior ncos i remember were career drunks or incompetents, the 10% or so i mentioned, so why aren't you demand huge cuts to the military?</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1347454688041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 08:58:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347455197584-4</Id><Title>Barclays presentation</Title><Msg>If they are not allowed to up stream money - they are still going to call the 12.5 on December 1 2012.

If they are simply sub-prime, but the owners are making payments, then there should not be a problem.

Ben Smith BuzzFeed Staff Posted Sep 12, 2012 11:10am EDT Mitt Romney's sharply-worded attack on President Obama over a pair of deadly riots in Muslim countries last night has backfired badly among foreign policy hands of both parties, who cast it as hasty and off-key, released before the facts were clear at what has become a moment of tragedy. Romney keyed his statement to the American Embassy in Cairo's condemnation of an anti-Muslim video that served as the trigger for the latest in a series of regional riots over obscure perceived slights to the faith. But his statement — initially embargoed to avoid release on September 11, then released yesterday evening anyway — came just before news that the American Ambassador to Libya had been killed and broke with a tradition of unity around national tragedies, and of avoiding hasty statements on foreign policy. It was the second time Romney has been burned by an early statement on a complex crisis: Romney denounced the Obama Administration's handling of a Chinese dissident's escape just as the Administration negotiated behind the scenes for his departure from the country. "They were just trying to score a cheap news cycle hit based on the embassy statement and now it’s just completely blown up," said a very senior Republican foreign policy hand, who called the statement an "utter disaster" and a "Lehman moment" — a parallel to the moment when John McCain, amid the 2008 financial crisis, failed to come across as a steady leader. He and other members of both parties cited the Romney campaign's recent dismissals of foreign policy's relevance. One adviser dismissed the subject to BuzzFeed as a "shiny object," while another told Politico that the subject was the "president's turf," drawing a rebuke from Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol. "I guess we see now that it is because they’re incompetent at talking effectively about foreign policy," said the Republican. "This is just unbelievable — when they decide to play on it they completely bungle it." Romney has not backed off the response — "It's never too early for the United States government to condemn attacks on Americans and to defend our values," he said Wednesday — but his campaign faces a near consensus in Republican foreign policy circles that, whatever the sentiment, Romney faltered badly. "It’s deeply unfortunate when the circumstance of the statement becomes the story," said Rick Perry's former foreign policy adviser, Victoria Coates, who is now an adjunct fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, and who suggested that Romney should simply have "gone earlier rather than save it for midnight" to avoid appearing to play politics on September 11. "It’s unfortunate that it’s playing out this way, and hopefully they can get back on message, because their point is sound," she said. Other conservatives were less sympathetic. "It's bad," said a former aide to Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. "Just on a factual level that the statement was not a response but preceding, or one could make the case precipitating. And just calling it a 'disgrace' doesn't really cut it. Not ready for prime time." A third Republican, a former Bush State Department official, told BuzzFeed, "It wasn't presidential of Romney to go political immediately — a tragedy of this magnitude should be something the nation collectively grieves before politics enters the conversation." But the third official defended the substance of Romney's words: "Romney's attack is spot-on — disgusting that the first Obama administration impulse was to apologize instead of condemning violent religious intolerance. Obama's gotten a real pass on his intervention in Libya, his failed strategy in Afghanistan, and his lack of leadership in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. By trying to cut it down the middle in his foreign policy, no one knows where or for what Obama or America stands in the world these days." The Republicans declined to speak for attribution, for fear of being publicly disloyal to their party's nominee. Veteran Democratic foreign policy hands, operating under no such restriction, called Romney's quick move all but disqualifying. "He did jump the gun. It revealed yet again that his foreign policy team is not ready for prime time," said David Rothkopf, a former Clinton State Department official. "It is ugly and amateurish. It also seems strangely out of character with Romney who elsewhere in the campaign seems inclined to be restrained to a fault." Heather Hurlburt, who heads the National Security Network, a Democratic group, said the statement "shows not just poor judgment and a willingness to use tragedy for political gains, regardless of the security consequences — but also poor management. He has policy people on his team who know better. Clearly they weren't consulted." "As someone who worked at state and with diplomats for many years, it makes me feel sick," she said. "Romney blew it and revealed how seriously maladroit he is when it comes to foreign affairs and national security," said Steve Clemons, the founder of the American Strategy Program at the New America Foundation. "An attack on an Embassy, the murder of U.S. officials including an Ambassador, is an attack on all Americans and the idea of America — and Romney gave terrorists what they want — a divided country still torn emotionally and politically by the events of 9-11. Romney talks of leadership but with his reckless commentary when events were fragile and still unfolding, he belly-flopped."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347474272902</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 14:24:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347474314245-23</Id><Topic><Title>FIRE ALL CHICAGO TEACHERS TODAY!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1347398599030</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 17:23:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Neither of you two answered my point of why don't these overworked and underpaid teachers quite their jobs...answer, nobody would hire them for half of what they are paid by the taxpayers, and you "no it".

Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has contributed more than $36 MILLION to various Republican Super PACs and has pledged to spend $100 MILLION in order to defeat President Obama and elect Mitt Romney. While $100 MILLION is a lot of money, it’s nothing compared to what Adelson stands to gain as a result of Mitt Romney’s tax policies. A new analysis out today finds that in just the four years of a Romney administration, Adelson could get a whopping $2.3 BILLION tax cut. That represents an astounding 2,200 percent return on his investment in Mitt Romney. Romney’s policies would potentially slash Adelson’s taxes: • Cut top tax rates, saving Adelson approximately $1.5 million on his annual compensation as chief executive of his casino company. • Maintain the special low rates on dividends, potentially saving Adelson nearly $120 million on a single year’s worth of dividends, more than enough to recoup his political donations. • Maintain the special low rates on capital gains, allowing Adelson to make back his political donations in capital gains tax cuts just by selling a fraction of his stock. • Provide a tax windfall of an estimated $1.2 billion to Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands Corp., on untaxed profits from its Asian casinos, as well as a tax exemption for future overseas profits. Adelson’s casinos already enjoy a special foreign tax exemption from the Chinese administrative region of Macau, and Gov. Romney would make those foreign profits exempt from U.S. taxes as well. • Eliminate the estate tax, potentially providing a staggering $8.9 billion windfall to Adelson’s heirs. Romney’s corporate tax reforms would also provide Adelson’s casino company approximately$1.2 billion in tax breaks on overseas profits and $565 million from Romney’s proposed shift to a territorial tax system. Adelson’s share of that, the report says, would be upward of $900 million, nine times what he pledged to spend to get Romney to the White House. BOTTOM LINE: Under Mitt Romney’s plan, middle class families would pay more so millionaires like Mitt Romney and billionaires like Sheldon Adelson could pay even less.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1347482571345</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 16:42:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347482907979-27</Id><Topic><Title>low volume manipulation</Title><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1346951463185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 13:11:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If etfc is strong tomorrow and fri, it will confirm a breakout very soon.

I suspect last night will become one of those moments for Mitt Romney. The verdict will not be positive. Romney’s attack was not only ill-judged and ill-timed, it was actually based on what appears to be a demonstrable falsehood. Romney, or folks writing in his name at his campaign, claimed that the administration’s first response to the attacks was to issue a press release condemning the anti-Islam film which had helped trigger the attack....In fact, according to all available press reports and the account of the State Department, the press release in question came from the US Embassy in Egypt and preceded the attacks. So to claim it was a response to the attacks was simply false. So while American diplomats were dying in the field, Romney pops up with an egregious attempt to politicize the deaths with a flat out lie. Behind the curtains a more chaotic and rash picture emerges...The campaign also authorized Romney’s top foreign policy advisor to give a blistering interview attacking the president while the attacks were continuing. Politics is hardball....But campaigns are also a prism into the judgment and steadiness under pressure of a person who would be president. This was amateur hour for the opposition campaign last night, reminiscent of John McCain’s rash call four years ago to cancel the presidential debates and the campaign itself to deal with the unfolding economic crisis. There was nothing ignoble or dishonorable about McCain’s suggestion...Romney’s moment was quite different — rash and shameful. Not worthy of a president. Crass, undignified and troubling on many levels.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347493621309</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 19:47:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347493625362-33</Id><Topic><Title>Barclays presentation</Title><Username>invlongtrm</Username><Timestamp>1347455197584</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 09:06:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They share the plan with respect to getting to 1 billion (or at least letting the world know that is still feasible - say for a buyer who is looking from outside).

Wed Sep 12, 2012 Unless the Romney campaign has gamed this crisis out in some manner completely invisible to the Gang of 500, his doubling down on criticism of the President for the statement coming out of Cairo is likely to be seen as one of the most craven and ill-advised tactical moves in this entire campaign. Romney’s decision to use a fatal attack on Americans as an opportunity to seek political gain based on a complete lie is just the latest example of his copyrighted #romneyshambles campaign. It is a classic #romneyfail. Jumping Ship Update: Romney’s decision to weigh in is generating criticism from fellow Republicans. Former Sen. John Sununu of New Hampshire said on MSNBC Wednesday morning: “They probably should have waited. … You look at the way things unfolded, you look at the timing of it, they probably should have waited.” Bracing for trouble before the start of the protests here and in Libya, the American Embassy released a statement shortly after noon that appeared to refer to Mr. Jones : "The United States Embassy in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions." It later denounced the "unjustified breach of our embassy." Apparently unaware of the timing of the first embassy statement, the Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, put out a statement just before midnight Tuesday saying, "It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks." Mr. Romney also said he was "outraged" at the attacks on the embassy and consulate.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347494683756</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 20:04:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347496651018-35</Id><Title>Wing nuts turning on each other</Title><Msg>NEWSMAX CEO: Romney campaign ‘poorly managed,’ message ‘incoherent’ by rdbaker43 Not generally a fan of wingnut campaign analysis, but there is this: If I could put my finger on it, I would say the Romney campaign has been poorly managed. They haven’t staged their candidate well, and their messaging has been incoherent, to put it nicely. ----Christopher Ruddy, editor and CEO of Newsmax Media Inc. And also this: We saw this mismanagement early in the primary. Those in the Romney campaign should have locked up their candidate’s nomination by January. But the campaign team decided they didn’t want to owe the conservative base of the GOP much, so they decided to forego the usual outreach efforts. Instead, they spent tens of millions of dollars in attack ads against fellow Republicans. And this: There were so many messages, it was disorienting: “Mitt is a regular guy.” “We’re a diverse party.” “Hi, I’m Chris Christie, and I’m running for re-election.” “Ann humanizes Mitt.” “We’re proud of the Mormon faith.” “The Bush years were not as bad as you thought.” “Bain Capital is not an evil company.” Add to these a bunch of sub-themes that have faded into oblivion. There is much more like this on the Houston Chronicle's website. (The article was originally published on NEWSMAX and reprinted on Houston Chronicle's website). 2:52 PM PT: And this is how the author sums up: Obama critics have been touting Edward Klein’s new best-selling book about Obama entitled “Amateur.” But it’s looking more and more that Obama is no amateur, while the Romney campaign has more than its fair share of them. Pandering FAIL, Mitt, pandering FAIL! Worst. Candidate.

Politically, Mitt Romney, relying on false information, called the Obama administration's response "disgraceful," and accused the administration of "sympathiz[ing] with those" who killed U.S. officials abroad. It seems as if Romney has finally gone too far. NBC News' First Read called out "one of the most over-the-top and (it turns out) incorrect attacks of the general-election campaign," which looks "worse and worse" as more information comes to light. This was news-cycle campaigning by the Romney campaign gone awry. Why didn't the Romney campaign wait until it had all the facts? On his overseas trip in the summer, Romney was so careful not to criticize Obama while on foreign soil. But how much time do you give an administration to work through a diplomatic and international crisis before trying to score immediate political points? You'd expect the Sarah Palins of the world to quickly pounce on something like this, and she predictably did. But a presidential nominee running for the highest office in the land? After the facts have come out, last night's Romney statement only feeds the narrative that his campaign is desperate. ABC News' Jake Tapper had a related report, noting the challenges facing the Obama administration in light of developments in Libya and Egypt, but also highlighting Romney's mistake. GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney will likely face questions of his own today, not only about his foreign policy views (Romney had at least five different positions on Libya as of last October) but about his statesmanship. Before news spread that four Americans had been killed in Benghazi, Romney yesterday issued a statement saying in part: "It's disgraceful that the Obama administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks." This is an attack that does not stand up to simple chronology. The Republican candidate was so eager to attack the president that he ended up lying while trying to exploit the deaths of four Americans abroad. Romney was faced with an important leadership test last night. He failed spectacularly.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347499659426</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 21:27:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347500758907-38</Id><Title>Leading From Behind: The Reluctant President and the Advisors Who Decide for Him</Title><Msg>Poor cowardly Barry says it must be Bush's fault.</Msg><Username>islam_needs_new_ceo_now</Username><Timestamp>1347500758907</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 21:45:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347507584576-39</Id><Title>BO donates $1 million to Romney</Title><Msg>Wed Sep 12, 2012 at 05:54 PM PDT Breaking: Obama campaign donates $1 million to Romney campaign by WilliamKWolfrum WASHINGTON – The re-election campaign for President Barack Obama has made a $1 million donation to the Mitt Romney campaign. The donation comes on the heels of Romney’s recent foray into foreign affairs, accusing Obama of sympathizing with Islamic extremists, despite the fact that it never happened and that Romney got just about everything about the situation wrong. Sources close to the Obama campaign said they wanted to make the donation to give Romney more chances to appear on television so voters could see more of him. “For a long time, we were worried about raising less money than the Romney campaign,” said an Obama campaign strategist. “Now we realize that it is an advantage for us. The more people see of Romney, the better things look for Barack.” Romney – who when still and silent looks incredibly Presidential – has struggled with his mouth and thought process the entire campaign. From forgetting to mention the troops at the RNC Convention, to seeming completely detached to how much money he actually has, to blatantly lying about Obama’s Presidency, and much, much more, Romney has put himself in line to be the worst Republican nominee for President since John McCain. The Team Obama source said that it is obvious that Romney gets stupider the more money he has, thus it is vital for him to speak as much as possible these next two months. “He looks good, but the man has no clue, and we want to hear more from him,” said the source. “So we ask all Obama supporters to donate to the Romney campaign. Because the more people see Mitt, the more people will realize he has no business being anywhere near the Presidency.” –WKW Crossposted at William K.
