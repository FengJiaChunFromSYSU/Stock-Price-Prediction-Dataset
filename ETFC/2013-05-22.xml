Bush, former CIA director George Tenet, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former Vice President #$%$ Cheney are all named in Human Rights Watch's ne A well-known human rights group wants the U.S. to launch a criminal probe into former President George W. Bush's authorization of enhanced interrogation of terror suspects. Human Rights Watch also is demanding that foreign governments prosecute Bush if the U.S. does not launch a credible investigation. The organization's demands come with the release of a new report Tuesday, titled "Getting Away with Torture: The Bush Administration and Mistreatment of Detainees." The 107-page document asks that former Vice President #$%$ Cheney, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and CIA Director George Tenet also be investigated for authorizing the use of waterboarding and for launching secret CIA prisons. In his 2010 memoir, "Turning Points," Bush acknowledged he approved the use of waterboarding on two separate occasions. The New York-based Human Rights Watch charged in its report that the Obama administration has failed in its legal responsibility to hold the previous administration accountable for its actions. "President Obama has treated torture as an unfortunate policy choice rather than a crime," Kenneth Roth, the group's executive director, said in a written statement.

Saddam was under sanction, as long as he was in charge the Iraqi people would be under these sanctions which didn't hurt the elite, but caused the poorer elements of the population to suffer. Sanctions COULD be lifted but we knew that Saddam would use the oil revenue to rebuild his military and NOT his civil infrastructure as a priority. As a leader Saddam would have represted a continuing threat to the US and regional allys. What do you. So far I've come up with ONE answer that didn't involved total war (at least not much more of an escalation of what already existed) but NO liberal tongue wagger has yet to come up with a reasonable solution. Question is, can you break the record? Give it a shot . . . and, btw, Bush didn't "lie", unless its a determination of a "lie" if someone tells a falsehood they believe. Saddam's intelligence services where there to try to make sure foreign intelligence organs, particularly those from neighboring states, decided he DID have WMD so they'd stay off his back. In baiting the Eagle the Great Saddam screwed up in that he failed to make it clear to the UN inspectors that he wasn't running a disinformation op against them to make them think he was clean, but a disinformation op against his neighbors so they'd think twice about attacking a weakened Iraq (That info courtesy of Saddam himself and some of his captured Intel folks). So hey, put yourself in the hot seat, or go back to my posts from 2003 where I posited precisely this situation (No WMD and Saddam trying to pretend like there are) and the likely outcomes. My solution to the problem is also posted about that time, but no cheating and reading it until you've come up with your own.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369230857245</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:54:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369231133113-22</Id><Topic><Title>Fox News Dominates</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369089087386</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 18:31:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One scoop in like 2 years is not dominating, if anything its lagging.

New York didn't even have basic breakwater protection in places it should have being an Atlantic port, and in some cases what was available was less than what we have at Huron Harbor, on Lake Erie, one of the tamest of the Great Lakes. I mean, gimme a break, it wasn't as bad as New Orleans where the flood protection was in places over 50 years old, it was worse in that the flood protection wasn't there at all. If a bunch of people get together and build a down in a gully which washes away at the first flash flood, is it a federal disaster, or one sorry group of very stupid people? A great many of the houses and businesses wiped out in New York were literally projecting into the Atlantic Ocean. I feel NO sympathy for them whatsoever, and that the only aid they should receive beyond immediate life saving care, is perhaps a course that teaches basic common sense and prudence. Respect nature, don't build on Oceanfront Property unless you're willing to let it become part of the Ocean, and if you INSIST on putting a port city by the sea instead of on a river, put in proper breakwalls and surge protection. Your typical tornado there isn't much you can do about it if you live anywhere other than a semi mountainous or mountainous area that's too high up for them to develop, but if you live in the central plains states, or ANYWHERE (Northern Ohio gets its share, though not typically that big) where a tornado can get moving without significant terrain features like mountains, forests, or large bodies of water to dissipate the energy, then you MAY get hit. If you live on the coast you WILL get hit, with the level of damage depending on the power of the storm and what precautions you've taken.

You can only sustain an artificial jobs boom on stimulus money for so long before you gotta let people go so they can file for unemployment . . . then file for SSDI and get unemployment while their claim is being adjudicated. Didn't use to be that unemployment lasted more than 14 weeks, now its more like what, a year?? The exact interval between filing an SSDI claim and when you can begin to receive benefits. Now isn't THAT special. Social Security examiners have been instructed to err on the side of the applicant, so unless you catch them running a marathon after accepting a Nobel in physics, they're on for life. Heck I could work if I could find an employer who would allow all this medical hardware and liquid oxygen into the work place. At least PART time. That option of course doesn't exist. I'd be a slam bang analyst (though I turned that job down a long time before I was this disabled, I didn't want the hassles of a job where you had to watch what you said and couldn't talk about work except AT work). The problem is nothing I can do fits in the normal conception of a job, so I guess I'll just have to wait until my yearly gains are SO large they get taxed before I'm paying Uncle again, at least directly. A person on SSDI does NOT count as "unemployed" in the numbers the Obama (and almost every other) administration uses. Hence everyone they move to disability, military or SSDI, is a "decrease" in unemployment.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369258731348</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 17:38:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369258743876-44</Id><Topic><Title>'SPANKER' is quite the unhinged Liberal</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369054009135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 08:46:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>O.k....elks"MEMBER"... go lube up with 'SPANKER" in Liberal Lube bath house, enjoy your A.I.D.s</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369258743876</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 17:39:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369259228462-45</Id><Title>FauxNews dominates the gerbil</Title><Msg>gerbil, You have lost it for a long time already and you think you dominate this board with obscene crapola.
