The famous Obama joke: "'Shovel-ready was not as shovel-ready as we expected' in June 2011. Stimulus kicked off full speed in 3rd quarter of 2009, when economy almost made it into positive territory. In May 2009 GDP stopped bleeding, In June economy broke even. So, 8.9% contraction was eliminated without any external help, virtually on its own. You have guts to say Obama has something to do with it? What a joke! Every sharp economy drop is proceeded with natural sharp recovery. In 1958 economy recovered very quickly after record drop of -10.4%. It was also the case right before Great Depression when FDR decided to "help" with his Keynesian policies. What -10.4% drop in 1958 meant? Nothing. We did it. That's all. We did it in 2009 too. Now I quote it to you 3rd time, since you pretend to be deaf: "from 2010 through 2013, the administration assumes that real GDP will grow at a 4% annual rate. To put this in perspective, that is twice as fast as the economy's 2% annual rate of growth between 2004 and 2008." The prediction was for more than 3 years ahead, not just for first 6 months of recovery. Do you hear me now? Still don't?</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1363066327679</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 01:32:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363071781489-2</Id><Topic><Title>When was the last time this thing was over 12??</Title><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1363033641644</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:27:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yup..

Pretend journalist and Republican activist Hannah Giles agreed to pay $50,000 to former San Diego ACORN worker Juan Carlos Vera as a part of a legal settlement struck last summer in response to an invasion of privacy lawsuit filed against her and her former partner James O'Keefe, Vera's attorney has confirmed to The BRAD BLOG. Last week, in a scoop by the website Wonkette, it was disclosed that O'Keefe, a federal criminal and professional liar, agreed to pay $100,000 in his own legal settlement with the same former ACORN employee, after heading up the scheme to secretly videotape him in violation of California's Invasion of Privacy Act. O'Keefe and Giles' illicit taping of Vera occurred as part of the deceptively edited series of hit videos released by the pair in 2009. The tapes were published, and paid for, by the late con-man Andrew Breitbart. Vera had been portrayed in the misleading video as having been willing to help the pair smuggle underage prostitutes into America across the Mexican border. In fact, Vera had played along with the duo's ridiculous proposed scheme only long enough to collect information from both O'Keefe and Giles, including taking their photographs, before contacting law enforcement immediately after the secretly video-taped meeting.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363101289881</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 11:14:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363102808545-7</Id><Topic><Title>Dow Hits New All-Time High, Sees 7th Day of Gains</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363098989093</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 10:36:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Conservatives in CHEERS!!!

Baring a major catastrophe like losing 50% of its value, you're better of buying actual stock on margin than buying options for the simple reason that the short term vig on the margin is FAR less than what the option underwriters are going to take from you, and you can end up with just about as much leverage versus the in the money calls, if not so with a wild gamble on out of the money calls.

Normally, national security documents are passed from the outgoing President to the incoming President to maintain continuity in government. But Haldeman and Kissinger had come up empty in their search. They were only able to recreate the file’s contents, which included incriminating conversations between Nixon’s emissaries and South Vietnamese officials regarding Nixon’s promise to get them a better deal if they helped him torpedo Johnson’s peace talks. So, the missing file remained a troubling mystery inside Nixon’s White House, but Nixon still lived up to his pre-election agreement with South Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu to extend U.S. military participation in the war with the goal of getting the South Vietnamese a better outcome than they would have received from Johnson in 1968. Nixon not only continued the Vietnam War, which had already claimed more than 30,000 American lives and an estimated one million Vietnamese, but he expanded it, with intensified bombing campaigns and a U.S. incursion into Cambodia. At home, the war was bitterly dividing the nation with a massive anti-war movement and an angry backlash from war supporters.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363137834872</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 21:23:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363138597246-32</Id><Topic><Title>When was the last time this thing was over 12??</Title><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1363033641644</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:27:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did the government refuse the aid to Etrade or did Etrade fail to provide the conditions to get qualified for the aid?</Msg><Username>etfc2013</Username><Timestamp>1363138597246</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 21:36:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363138824421-33</Id><Topic><Title>Why spend $1.5 million to understand why Lesbians are overweight</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363119880078</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 16:24:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New research shows It's the calorie laden yeast infection appetite that's plumping these whales..</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1363138824421</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 21:40:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363146041968-34</Id><Title>California Seizes Guns as Owners Lose Right to Keep Arms</Title><Msg>By Michael B. Marois and James Nash - Mar 12, 2013 Wearing bulletproof vests and carrying 40-caliber Glock pistols, nine California Justice Department agents assembled outside a ranch-style house in a suburb east of Los Angeles. They were looking for a gun owner who’d recently spent two days in a mental hospital. They knocked on the door and asked to come in. About 45 minutes later, they came away peacefully with three firearms. California is the only state that tracks and disarms people with legally registered guns who have lost the right to own them, according to Attorney General Kamala Harris. Almost 20,000 gun owners in the state are prohibited from possessing firearms, including convicted felons, those under a domestic violence restraining order or deemed mentally unstable. “What do we do about the guns that are already in the hands of persons who, by law, are considered too dangerous to possess them?” Harris said in a letter to Vice President Joe Biden after a Connecticut school shooting in December left 26 dead. She recommended that Biden, heading a White House review of gun policy, consider California as a national model. As many as 200,000 people nationwide may no longer be qualified to own firearms, according to Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis. Other states may lack confiscation programs because they don’t track purchases as closely as California, which requires most weapons sales go through a licensed dealer and be reported. “Very, very few states have an archive of firearm owners like we have,” said Wintemute, who helped set up the program. Funding Increase Harris, a 48-year-old Democrat, has asked California lawmakers to more than double the number of agents from the current 33. They seized about 2,000 weapons last year. Agents also took 117,000 rounds of ammunition and 11,000 high-capacity magazines, according to state data. “We’re not contacting anybody who can legally own a gun,” said John Marsh, a supervising agent who coordinates the sometimes-contentious seizures. “I got called the Antichrist the other day. Every conspiracy theory you’ve heard of, take that times 10.” The no-gun list is compiled by cross-referencing files on almost 1 million handgun and assault-weapon owners with databases of new criminal records and involuntary mental-health commitments. About 15 to 20 names are added each day, according to the attorney general’s office.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363146041968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 23:40:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363146156819-35</Id><Topic><Title>California Seizes Guns as Owners Lose Right to Keep Arms</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363146041968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 23:40:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Probable Cause Merely being in a database of registered gun owners and having a “disqualifying event,” such as a felony conviction or restraining order, isn’t sufficient evidence for a search warrant, Marsh said March 5 during raids in San Bernardino County. So the agents often must talk their way into a residence to look for weapons, he said. At a house in Fontana, agents were looking for a gun owner with a criminal history of a sex offense, pimping, according to the attorney general’s office. Marsh said that while the woman appeared to be home, they got no answer at the door. Without a warrant, the agents couldn’t enter and had to leave empty- handed. They had better luck in nearby Upland, where they seized three guns from the home of Lynette Phillips, 48, who’d been hospitalized for mental illness, and her husband, David. One gun was registered to her, two to him. “The prohibited person can’t have access to a firearm,” regardless of who the registered owner is, said Michelle Gregory, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office. Involuntarily Held In an interview as agents inventoried the guns, Lynette Phillips said that while she’d been held involuntarily in a mental hospital in December, the nurse who admitted her had exaggerated the magnitude of her condition. Todd Smith, chief executive officer of Aurora Charter Oak Hospital in Covina, where documents provided by Phillips show she was treated, didn’t respond to telephone and e-mail requests for comment on the circumstances of the treatment.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363146156819</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 23:42:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363146221052-36</Id><Topic><Title>California Seizes Guns as Owners Lose Right to Keep Arms</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363146041968</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 23:40:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Phillips said her husband used the guns for recreation. She didn’t blame the attorney general’s agents for taking the guns based on the information they had, she said. “I do feel I have every right to purchase a gun,” Phillips said. “I’m not a threat. We’re law-abiding citizens.” No one was arrested. Most seized weapons are destroyed, Gregory said. “It’s not unusual to not arrest a mental-health person because every county in the state handles those particular cases differently,” Gregory said by e-mail. “Unless there’s an extenuating need to arrest them on the spot, we refer the case” to the local district attorney’s office, she said. Convicted Felons Agents more often arrest convicted felons who are prohibited from buying, receiving, owning or possessing a firearm, Gregory said. Violation of the ban is itself a felony. The state Senate agreed March 7 to expand the seizure program using $24 million in surplus funds from fees that gun dealers charge buyers for background checks. Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the National Rifle Association, a gun lobby based in Fairfax, Virginia, that says it has more than 4 million individuals as members, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the program. Sam Paredes, executive director of the Folsom-based advocacy group Gun Owners of California, praised the program, though not how it is funded. “We think that crime control instead of gun control is absolutely the way to go,” he said. “The issue we have is funding this program only from resources from law-abiding gun purchasers. This program has a benefit to the entire public and therefore the entire public should be paying through general- fund expenditures, and not just legal gun owners.”</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363146221052</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 23:43:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363146951808-37</Id><Title>Catholic Church accidentally buys a gay sauna</Title><Msg>by Kaili Joy Gray What kind of gay sauna would Jesus buy? Don't you just hate when this happens? A day ahead of the papal conclave, faces at the scandal-struck Vatican were even redder than usual after it emerged that the Holy See had purchased a €23 million (£21 million) share of a Rome apartment block that houses Europe’s biggest gay sauna. Oh, how very awkward. While the Church is busy spending so much of its time shaking its bejeweled fist at The Gays, turns out the Church accidentally—accidentally, you guys, accidentally!—invested in some fabulous gay real estate. So how did this happen? The senior Vatican figure sweating the most due to the unlikely proximity of the gay Europa Multiclub is probably Cardinal Ivan Dias, the head of the Congregation for Evangelisation of Peoples, who is due to participate in tomorrow’s election at the Sistine Chapel. This 76-year-old “prince of the church” enjoys a 12-room apartment on the first-floor of the imposing palazzo, at 2 Via Carducci, just yards from the ground floor entrance to the steamy flesh pot. There are 18 other Vatican apartments in the block, many of which house priests. A 12-room apartment for one dude sure seems pretty posh, doesn't it? Especially a dude who supposedly took a vow of poverty? Guess if he hadn't, it would be a 24-room apartment, eh? At least it sounds like the perfect investment for the Church: The sauna’s website promotes one of its special “bear nights”, with a video in which a rotund, hairy man strips down before changing into a priest’s outfit. It says Bruno, “a hairy, overweight pastor of souls, is free to the music of his clergyman, remaining in a thong, because he wants to expose body and soul”. What a fortuitous accident.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363146951808</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 23:55:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
