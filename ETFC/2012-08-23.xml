Romney says he does not oppose contraception. Yet he has supported a state constitutional amendment, known as a personhood amendment, that defines life as beginning at conception. This is at odds with the medical community, which defines pregnancy as beginning with the implantation of a fertilized egg in a woman’s uterine lining, which occurs at least three days after conception. Such an amendment could outlaw any form of contraception that is believed by some to interfere with the implantation process, such as the birth control pill or some forms of intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Gov. Romney also refers to emergency contraceptives as “abortive pills,” even though they can only prevent pregnancy and will not work if a woman is already pregnant. And when he was governor of Massachusetts, he vetoed legislation that required hospitals to offer emergency contraception to rape victims and that made emergency contraceptives available over the counter without a prescription in his state. Finally, he has said that he disagrees with the Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which recognized the constitutional right to privacy and the right of married couples to use contraception. Instead, he questioned whether it should be a federal right, arguing that he would support returning the issue to the states. In other words, whether a woman has the right to obtain and use contraception would depend on where she lives. Gov. Romney would also make it harder for low-income women and women of color to access affordable birth control. He was the only Republican presidential primary candidate to propose completely eliminating the Title X national family planning program—because, according to him, it is not “essential” and because it benefits organizations such as Planned Parenthood, which provides abortion care with nonfederal funds. However, this would cut off family planning services to over 5 million people each year, 20 percent of whom are black and 29 percent of whom are Latina. Many of Gov. Romney’s conservative colleagues have taken a hard line in their efforts to defund Planned Parenthood as part of their antiabortion strategy—and many have also voted to defund Title X, including his vice presidential pick, Rep. Paul Ryan—but few have openly advocated that the Title X program be completely eliminated. Moreover, when asked how he would cut the federal budget deficit, Gov. Romney’s response included that he would “get rid of ” Planned Parenthood. Leaving aside the demonstrably negligible effect this would have on overall government spending, the safety net provided by Planned Parenthood is essential for millions of women in this country who rely on the clinic’s services for cancer screenings, treatment for sexually transmitted infections, and prenatal care, in addition to affordable contraception. This would be particularly devastating to women of color, who face a host of reproductive health disparities including sexually transmitted infections, poor birth outcomes, maternal mortality, unintended pregnancy, abortion, and HIV/AIDS.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345694572000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 00:02:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345694660000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot's assault on women</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345692459000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:27:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Finally, Gov. Romney pledges to restore and strengthen the so-called Bush conscience rule, which would permit health care providers and entities to refuse to provide or cover health care services that they find morally objectionable. This rule was an expansive reading by the George W. Bush administration of legal provisions that only enabled health care workers and entities such as hospitals and health maintenance organizations to object to performing, counseling, referring for, or covering abortion. But President Bush broadly interpreted the law to apply to any health care service, including contraception, end-of-life care, HIV treatments, and many others, and extended it beyond doctors, nurses, and pharmacists to candy stripers, janitors, ambulance drivers, and health insurance claims officers, to name just a few examples. If elected, Gov. Romney would reinstate this overreaching regulation. Gov. Romney also supported the failed Blunt Amendment, which would have undermined an Obama administration regulation that requires health insurance plans to cover contraception with no cost-sharing, such as co-pays or deductibles. The amendment, named after Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO), would allow employers and insurers to refuse to cover any health care service, including but not limited to contraception, that they find objectionable for moral or religious reasons. Romney would support efforts to outlaw abortion Gov. Romney has called Roe v. Wade, the case that established a constitutional right to abortion, “one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history.” As with contraception, he supports letting the states decide whether abortion should be legal. He also has said he “absolutely” would support a state constitutional amendment to define life as beginning at conception. And vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan has sponsored a similar federal measure in Congress. These would outlaw abortion under all circumstances with no exceptions. Such a law might also interfere with the treatment of ectopic pregnancies, with some fertility treatments, and with some methods of contraception, as described above.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345694660000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 00:04:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345697027000-4</Id><Title>Dipshidiot's assault on the middle class</Title><Msg>Mortgage interest deduction shunned by GOP: http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-08-21/ahead-of-convention-republicans-ditch-mortgage-deduction</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345697027000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 00:43:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345700049000-5</Id><Topic><Title>$9.03!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Gawker has obtained a massive cache of confidential financial documents that shed a great deal of light on those finances, and on the tax-dodging tricks available to the hyper-rich that he has used to keep his effective tax rate at roughly 13% over the last decade. Today, we are publishing more than 950 pages of internal audits, financial statements, and private investor letters for 21 cryptically named entities in which Romney had invested—at minimum—more than $10 million as of 2011 (that number is based on the low end of ranges he has disclosed—the true number is almost certainly significantly higher). Almost all of them are affiliated with Bain Capital, the secretive private equity firm Romney co-founded in 1984 and ran until his departure in 1999 (or 2002, depending on whom you ask). Many of them are offshore funds based in the Cayman Islands. Together, they reveal the mind-numbing, maze-like, and deeply opaque complexity with which Romney has handled his wealth, the exotic tax-avoidance schemes available only to the preposterously wealthy that benefit him, the unlikely (for a right-wing religious Mormon) places that his money has ended up, and the deeply hypocritical distance between his own criticisms of Obama's fiscal approach and his money managers' embrace of those same policies. They also show that some of the investments that Romney has always described as part of his retirement package at Bain weren't made until years after he left the company. Bain isn't a company so much as an intricate suite of steadily proliferating inter-related holding companies and limited partnerships, some based in Delaware and others in the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, and elsewhere, designed to collectively house roughly $66 billion in wealth in its many crevices and chambers. When Romney left in 1999, he and his wife retained significant investments in many of those Bain vehicles—he claims they are "passive investments" and that they are managed in a blind trust (though the trustee isn't blind enough to meet federal standards of independence). But aside from disparate snippets of information contained in his federal and Massachusetts financial disclosure forms, his 2010 tax returns, and SEC filings, the nature of those investments has been obfuscated by design. When he disclosed his finances to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics in 2007, Romney took care to publish the underlying holdings of many funds he invested with—after disclosing his $1 million-plus stake in "GS 2002 Exchange Place Fund LP," for instance, he listed six pages of individual equities the fund held, from Panera Bread Co. to Tribune Co. But when it came to the Bain investments, he simply listed the value of his investments in odd-sounding entities like "Sankaty High Yield Partners II LP" with no indication of what was inside. In an accompanying note, he claimed that he had tried and failed to get the information: "The filer has requested information about the underlying holdings of these funds and values and income amounts for these underlying holdings. However, the fund managers have informed the filer in writing that this information is confidential and proprietary, and has declined to provide such information."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345742800000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 13:26:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345742843000-28</Id><Title>Did the ceo fumble the Knight Capital situation?</Title><Msg>Just read that Scottrade got a nice lump of KCG preferred.

Eight of the entities we've obtained documents for are based in the Cayman Islands; Romney's 2011 holdings in them amounted to at least $4.6 million (though the actual number could be many times higher). The audited financial statements we've obtained from those offshore funds are refreshingly clear on the tax consequences of not being located in the United States. Here's how the 2009 audited financial statement for Bain Capital Fund VIII LP, a $3.7 billion fund in which the Romneys had invested more than $1 million as of 2011, put it: The Partnership is a qualified intermediary and intends to conduct it operations so that it will not be engaged in a United States trade or business and, therefore, will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax on its income from United States sources.... Under the current laws of the Cayman Islands, there are no income, estate, transfer, sales, or other Cayman Islands taxes payable by the Partnership. All the other Cayman funds have similar language in their statements. Bain Capital Fund VIII LP recorded a $643 million net increase in capital for the nine months ended September 2010 from its investments in Burlington Coat Factory, FleetCor, and other American (and international) firms, and distributed $572 million of that to its partners. The fund's manager, Bain Capital Partners LLC, is a Delaware corporation located at Bain Capital's Boston headquarters. It is of course breathtakingly routine and legal for hedge funds and equity funds (and blog companies!) to locate themselves in the Cayman Islands for tax, regulatory, and privacy reasons—Romney claims the funds are in the Caymans to allow foreign investors access—but the idea that Bain's funds aren't "engaged in United States trade or business" is a laughable fiction.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345743478000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 13:37:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345743505000-30</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot's taxes again</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345742800000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 13:26:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A perhaps less well-known, and sketchier, method for avoiding taxes is something called an equity swap, and several of Romney's funds make use of the trick, according to the documents. Simply put, equity swaps are agreements to exchange the gain or loss on a particular set of assets without actually transferring ownership. According to a 2008 Senate Finance Committee report, they are also a "key type of transaction used by U.S. financial institutions to help offshore clients, including offshore hedge funds, dodge payment of dividend taxes." The New York Times reported in 2010 that the IRS is scrutinizing equity swaps as a tax avoidance scheme, because the agency "suspects that the banks are disguising who owns stock[s] in order to help their offshore hedge fund clients avoid the withholding tax — a tax the banks are supposed to collect." Four of the equity and hedge funds Romney invests in engage in equity swaps, according to the documents. Absolute Capital Return Partners LP, a $929 million fund in which the Romneys had invested $1.25 million as of 2011, entered into equity swap contracts worth $288 million in 2009, recording a $13 million profit on the deals, according to its 2009 audited financial statements. (Absolute Capital Return is organized in Delaware, but two offshore entities—Absolute Capital Return Cayman Limited and Absolute Capital Return Cayman PA—own 21% of the partnership.) Viking Global Equities LP and Taconic Capital Partners 1.5 LP, two hedge funds that the Romneys are invested in via a Goldman Sachs so-called "fund of funds," also reported equity swaps in statements we obtained. The documents are also chock full of in AIVs, or alternative investment vehicles—holding corporations specifically established to help specific partners avoid taxes (or other legal issues) on specific investments. According to Bain Capital Fund IX LP's 2009 financial statements, the fund had diverted $1.5 billion of its funds to 18 AIVs established "to accomodate tax, legal, or similar concerns" of its partners, with evocative names like "Bain Capital (SSS 1-F) LP." Again, offshore shell partnerships, equity swaps, and AIVs are routine tricks that the hyper-wealthy use to minimize their tax exposure. And they are one of many reasons that Romney has paid just 13% in federal taxes over the last ten years.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345743505000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 13:38:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345744721208-31</Id><Topic><Title>Colorado U says Rumney Ryan win</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1345734189000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 11:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wisconsin Independent voters now backing Romney/Ryan ticket, thus WI is no longer a swing state!

"Our church doesn’t publish how much people have given," Romney tells Parade magazine in an edition due out Sunday. "This is done entirely privately. One of the downsides of releasing one’s financial information is that this is now all public, but we had never intended our contributions to be known. It’s a very personal thing between ourselves and our commitment to our God and to our church." Romney has released his 2010 tax returns in his White House campaign and, so far, a summary of last year’s tax information. But despite pressure from Republican opponents in the primaries and President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign, Romney has refused to disclose more. While it may not be a major reason, Romney says disclosing his charitable donations isn’t something he wants to do."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345752200000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 16:03:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345752210148-45</Id><Title>Gutted.......</Title><Msg>Those shares purchased by the new interm CEO are about to be underwater.

School cancels event found to be demeaning to latinos "Seniores" and "Señoritas" events held at an Anaheim high school — in which students dressed as gang members and a pregnant woman pushing a baby stroller — have been canceled after officials concluded the activities were demeaning toward Latinos and their culture. The events, which have been held for at least three years at Canyon High School, took place during senior activity week in June and were approved by campus administrators, according to school district officials. The event was canceled after the Orange Unified School District launched an internal investigation in June in response to two complaints filed by former students. I conclude there was a lack of oversight/supervision and that the school administration should not have allowed this activity," Aileen M. Sterling, "Even if strict guidelines were provided," Sterling said, "the result would still lead to hurtful and demeaning messages about the Mexican culture and to the students of the Mexican, Hispanic and Latino descent." Former student Jared Garcia-Kessler, 19, who graduated last year, said he complained to a teacher in 2011 but decided to file a formal complaint after he learned the event was held again at the Anaheim Hills school. "Enough was enough," Garcia-Kessler told The Times on Wednesday evening. "I was hurt." Recent years, about 55% of the students at Canyon High were white and about 16% were Latino, according to a Times database of California schools. The faculty was 87% white and about 8% Latino. Campus administrators will undergo diversity and sensitivity training, and the school will offer an ethnic studies class for students and hold an International Week activity in the 2012-13 school year, according to Sterling. In the most recent event in June, two boys dressed as a gardener and the woman pushing the baby stroller. Other students dressed as U.S. Border Patrol agents and "gang members with bandannas and tear drops," the investigation found. Some students wore large sombreros and fake mustaches.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1345753615043</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 16:26:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345753670556-51</Id><Title>Markets tank!</Title><Msg>ALL markets are down on "leaked news" that the OBIMBO ADMINISTRATION is about to have another STIMULUS and printing more money!

Fox News said on Thursday that it had identified the real identity of the Navy SEAL who is writing a book about his participation in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The Associated Press later confirmed the report. The forthcoming publication of the book, titled "No Easy Day," was announced on Wednesday. It will be released on September 11, and has not been vetted or cleared by the Pentagon. The author is using a pseudonym, Mark Owen. But on Thursday, Fox News ran an item with what it claimed was the author's true name, Matt Bissonnette. It even named the town where he lives. The network cited "multiple sources" in its reporting. The AP later ran a similar report, citing current and former military officials. The Navy SEALs who killed bin Laden have previously been left unidentified.

If the movie is anything like its source material, we can expect it will be a mostly fraudulent journey. The movie is based on Dinesh D'Souza's book The Roots Of Obama's Rage, which received high praise from people like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, neither of whom have shown any qualms about promoting outright lies, distortions, and outlandish claims in the past. The New York Times reports that the film is partially financed by billionaire investor Joe Ricketts, who previously considered financing a multimillion dollar political ad campaign linking the racially charged rhetoric of Rev. Jeremiah Wright to President Obama. The central thesis of the book is that Obama has some sort of anti-colonial world view, handed down to him by his ancestors, that acts as the motivation behind his actions and policies as president. It is just another form of birtherism, albeit a more highbrow variety of the ongoing conservative conspiracy theory. Appearing on Beck's Fox show, D'Souza explained: Obama is not anti-American in that he wishes ill on America. He wants what's best for America. He thinks it's really bad for us to be a colonial power. And therefore, in his view, he is doing right for America by pulling us out, by knocking us off our pedestal, by in a sense taking us from being the world's arrogant superpower. He wants us to share the wealth. He thinks he's gonna get a better America. The problem is, he's stuck in this theory, he's frozen in this time machine. In a sense, he's a captive of the ideology of a Luo tribesman from the 1950s. It's an incredible idea. D'Souza boosts this ludicrous premise (Obama ran for the presidency because he hates colonialism ... just like America's founders!) using several claims that are simply not rooted in reality. A few examples: ■D'Souza claims that TARP and the federal bailout were programs that "Obama launched." Both programs began under the Bush administration. ■D'Souza claims Obama went by the name Barack to adopt his father's "African identity," but Obama has explicitly said his name change "was not some assertion of my African roots." ■D'Souza insists that references in Obama speeches to a "nuclear-free world" are evidence of "anti-colonialism," but Ronald Reagan made multiple references to the same concept. ■D'Souza claimed that Obama supported the release of the Lockerbie bomber because he sometimes "supports the release of terrorists who claim to be fighting wars of liberation against American aggression." But the Obama administration formally opposed the release in an official letter from the State Department. ■D'Souza claimed that Obama referred to BP as "British Petroleum" in a May 2010 speech. He never did. And D'Souza just goes on and on, inventing incidents that never happened, making historical claims that don't match up to the facts, shoehorning these made-up stories into a false narrative of racial resentment. It doesn't appear that D'Souza has corrected or amended his flawed premise. 2016: Obama's America is just repeating the same falsehoods with moving pictures."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345769982000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:59:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345770105000-69</Id><Topic><Title>Great Read</Title><Username>rubieuyo588</Username><Timestamp>1345728014000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:20:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i enjoyed your video thanks for the information good outlook</Msg><Username>stueberszu05405</Username><Timestamp>1345770105000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:01:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345772061000-70</Id><Topic><Title>Great Read</Title><Username>rubieuyo588</Username><Timestamp>1345728014000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:20:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Clear analysis.</Msg><Username>sandifordamr00804</Username><Timestamp>1345772061000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:34:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345772117000-71</Id><Title>Couldn't have "built it" without you, Uncle!</Title><Msg>"Vice Presidential pick Paul Ryan was put in an awkward position on Thursday when one of the speakers at his own campaign event bragged about getting government funding to help build his business.

Perry’s praise for government funding was odd, considering low public opinion of earmarks generally, and the Romney-Ryan campaign’s persistent focus on the fact that people build businesses themselves, not with the help of government.

(AP) — Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney says big business in the U.S. is "doing fine" in most places. Romney's assertions resembled President Barack Obama's remarks earlier this summer that the private sector "is doing fine." Republicans pounced on Obama's comments, saying they proved he was out of touch with the nation's economy. Speaking to donors Thursday near Minneapolis, Romney said he would focus on helping small business succeed. Romney says large businesses succeed in part because they can better manage government regulations and because they put money in "low tax havens around the world."

Mitt Romney’s policies on women’s rights, there is little to distinguish the Republican presidential candidate from the more radical elements of his party. The many examples of waffling by Gov. Romney are nothing more than attempts to obfuscate his true positions and claim that he is a moderate regarding social issues when he most certainly is not. Here’s the real truth about Gov. Romney’s anti-woman agenda: Whether we’re talking about women’s health, reproductive rights, or economic independence, he would take women backward. Mitt Romney: Bad for women’s health Women’s health has been under constant siege since Republicans overtook the House of Representatives and state governments in the 2010 midterm elections. The Republican record includes the all-male congressional panel debating insurance coverage for contraception, 33 attempts to repeal the health reform law and all of its benefits for women, vaginal probes in Virginia, and efforts to defund Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. Throughout the course of the Republican primary and into the general election, Gov. Romney has made it clear that he’s happy to lead this charge. Romney would repeal Obamacare and its critical protections for women’s health If elected president, perhaps the most damaging thing Gov. Romney could do to women’s health is repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Gov. Romney vows to do “on Day One” of his presidency. Why is this important to women’s health? Due largely to the high cost of health insurance coverage—especially for women without access to employer-based coverage—19 million American women between the ages of 18 and 64 were uninsured in 2011. And women of color comprise 36.3 percent of women in the United States, but disproportionately make up 53.2 percent of uninsured women. Uninsured women typically receive lower-quality care when they enter the health system, and they generally have poorer health outcomes than insured women.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345778694000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 23:24:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345778753000-80</Id><Topic><Title>Talibornagain assault on women</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345778694000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 23:24:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Moreover, whether insured or not, women tend to have higher out-of-pocket costs than men: Women of reproductive age spend 68 percent more than men on health care expenses. And more than half of American women report delaying needed medical care because of cost, while one-third of women report giving up basic necessities such as food, heat, or rent to pay for health care expenses. (see Figure 1) women report their health decisions are affected by cost Women without employer-based insurance coverage have it particularly hard in the so-called individual health insurance market, which discriminates against women in numerous ways and which Gov. Romney wants to maintain. Women are often charged much more for their health insurance coverage solely because of their gender, a practice known as gender rating. In fact, women currently pay $1 billion more than men each year in health insurance premiums in the individual market for the same benefit. While these women pay more, they get less. Many insurance plans in the individual market do not meet their basic needs. For instance, only 12 percent of individual plans cover maternity care—care that only women need—and even then those plans may impose long waiting periods and high deductibles that make the coverage meaningless.Insurers also routinely deny women coverage for gender-related pre-existing conditions such as breast cancer, a Cesarean section, domestic violence, or sexual assault. Obamacare remedies sex discrimination in the insurance market by requiring coverage for maternity care, prohibiting gender rating, and eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions. Obamacare also makes health care more affordable by guaranteeing no-cost coverage for recommended preventive services such as mammograms, Pap smears, well-baby care, contraception, gestational diabetes screening, lactation supports, and much more. Approximately 47 million women will have access to women’s preventive services without cost-sharing under the Affordable Care Act, including 5.1 million African American, 4.9 million Latina, 2.5 Asian American, 300,000 American Indian, and 800,000 other American women.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345778753000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 23:25:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345778844000-81</Id><Topic><Title>Talibornagain assault on women</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345778694000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 23:24:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Women also benefit from other financial protections in Obamacare because they use the health care system more for their own needs and for those of their families. The health reform law makes insurance more affordable by providing tax credits to those who need help paying their premiums and by expanding eligibility for Medicaid. Women of color will benefit in particular from expanded insurance coverage as they face disproportionately high rates of a range of health conditions, including heart disease, hypertension, obesity, certain forms of cancer, and diabetes. In addition, recent studies of Medicaid expansions have been shown to significantly bring down mortality rates, especially for nonwhite enrollees. Obamacare established a number of other financial protections. Insurers must send rebates to enrollees if the company spends less than 80 percent of premiums of paying for health care services. The law has eliminated lifetime caps on coverage and is phasing out annual caps. Nearly 40 million women, especially those with chronic conditions, have already benefited from the ban on lifetime limits. And new health insurance plans will have to cap co-pays and deductibles, which will help reduce the amount women pay in out-of-pocket expenses. Finally, Obamacare gives women peace of mind. Plans can no longer kick someone off when they get sick or because they made an honest mistake in their application. Children can no longer be denied coverage for a childhood illness. And young adults can stay on their parents’ plans until age 26. Gov. Romney wants to take these benefits away. In addition to promising to repeal Obamacare, he has endorsed the proposed Republican budget put forth by the budget committee chairman in the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan (R-WI). Not only did he endorse Ryan’s budget, he then named Rep. Ryan as his running mate. The Ryan budget dismantles the Affordable Care Act in a number of ways and would: Eliminate the ban on pre-existing condition exclusions Scrap the requirement that insurers allow young people to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26 End regulations that prohibit lifetime caps on coverage Do away with health insurance premium subsidies for low-income Americans Torpedo the guarantee for no-cost preventive services such as well-woman care, childhood vaccinations, and flu shots This is no way to help women improve health care for themselves and their families, yet Gov. Romney is fully supportive of the Ryan budget.
