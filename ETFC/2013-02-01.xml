The Newtown Board of Education wants more armed police officers in the town's four elementary schools after the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary. Last night, they decided to ask the town to approve the request to include one additional full-time Newtown police at each of the elementary schools in next year's budget. Members of the board will meet today with state and federal officials about obtaining additional funding for security. “Our parents are demanding of us that things are made safe and secure and certain measures are put in place,” Chairwoman Debbie Leidlein said. “So we’re being very thoughtful.” Several police officers have been stationed at all Newtown schools since the Dec. 14 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, where 20 children and six staff members were killed. Those officers will remain at the school through the remainder of the school year, but the budget for the next fiscal year funds only resource officers at middle and high schools. Parents said security means more than a police presence. “My main concern is with accessibility to these school, said Neil Johnson, a parent of two Newtown students. “On December 14th, that was the main bare-boned reason that occurred.” “After what happened in our community, I just think we should go over and above and provide a shining example for the rest of the world and protect our kids,” said resident Donna Lorenz.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1359741117304</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 12:51:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359741339745-5</Id><Title>What Dud</Title><Msg>schw is pushing 17 and they pay a dividend, amtd too.</Msg><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1359741339745</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 12:55:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359742411230-6</Id><Topic><Title>LMAO@ junglebop and the other anti-gunfreaks</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1359741117304</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 12:51:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, but this goes against everything Barry stands for.

Another debacle brought to you from the folks on the left. **Bronze will be the lowest tier health-insurance plan available under Obamacare** IRS: Cheapest Obamacare Plan Will Be $20,000 Per Family In a final regulation issued Wednesday, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assumed that under Obamacare the cheapest health insurance plan available in 2016 for a family will cost $20,000 for the year. Under Obamacare, Americans will be required to buy health insurance or pay a penalty to the IRS. The IRS's assumption that the cheapest plan for a family will cost $20,000 per year is found in examples the IRS gives to help people understand how to calculate the penalty they will need to pay the government if they do not buy a mandated health plan. The examples point to families of four and families of five, both of which the IRS expects in its assumptions to pay a minimum of $20,000 per year for a bronze plan. “The annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) is $20,000,” the regulation says. Bronze will be the lowest tier health-insurance plan available under Obamacare--after Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Under the law, the penalty for not buying health insurance is supposed to be capped at either the annual average Bronze premium, 2.5 percent of taxable income, or $2,085.00 per family in 2016.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1359743884478</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:38:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359746598948-8</Id><Topic><Title>PPP: Hillary Could Carry Texas in 2016</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1359746352311</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:19:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hillery's a loser.

By Marcus K. Garner The Atlanta Journal-Constitution Atlanta Police on Friday said the student-on-student shooting Thurday at Price Middle School is being investigated by the department’s gang unit. Students began returning to Price Middle School Friday morning, a day after a 14-year-old boy was shot by a fellow student. A 14-year-old student was shot in the back of the neck Thursday on the grounds of Price Middle School in southeast Atlanta, conjuring up memories of the deadly shootings in Connecticut in December as terrified parents descended upon the school. The male shooting victim, whose name will not be released because he is a juvenile, was “alert, conscious and breathing” at Grady Memorial Hospital late Thursday afternoon, according to police. Hospital officials said he was treated at Grady Memorial Hospital and released Thursday evening. Another Price student was taken into custody, but had not been charged late Thursday. The student’s name and age were not released, but police said the shooting apparently resulted from a disagreement between the two boys. Police did not know the nature of the dispute or a motive for the shooting. A small caliber handgun was found at the scene. A teacher who was near the shooting was injured “while running” to get away, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said. The teacher was not injured by gunfire. Police have scheduled a 4 p.m. press conference Friday. Kelvin Fitzgerald, who was dropping his daughter off at school Friday morning, said he was surprised by the lack of a police presence just one day after the shooting. “I thought there would be somebody here; I don’t see nothing. I just saw one down the street.” He called the shooting “sad, confusing … I still don’t have all the details.” Parent Cornelia Stone praised the school for its handling of the shooting. “I think the school handled it really well,” she said, “especially keeping our kids safe and keeping them on lockdown.” She said not being able to contact her children during the lockdown was “torture, but it really did help in the long run.” Friday morning, Fred Smith of Conyers stood outside the school beside a 10-foot cross. Smith said the message he was trying to convey was “that God’s still on the throne … that there’s still hope.” Smith said the area where the shooting occurred was one where “there’s a lot of single moms, fatherless kids … I believe that men need to start rising up again and taking care of their families.” The shooting occurred just before 2 p.m. outside of the school, Campos said. Atlanta Public Schools Superintendent Erroll Davis said it was not clear whether the shooter had to go through the school’s metal detector since the shooting took place outside the building. The victim’s aunt, Keonia Clark, said her nephew was “doing OK.” “His mother is being strong for him,” Clark said. “This is a terrible thing for something like this to happen.” Clark described her nephew as a humble child who loves music and girls and plays on the football team. “He’s just like any other 14-year old,” she said.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1359754999819</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 16:43:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359756012242-14</Id><Topic><Title>-= =- Major ETFC Pre Promotion Report (LEAKED!!!!) -= =-</Title><Username>fosterjoseph487</Username><Timestamp>1359407914135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 16:18:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful info, thanks</Msg><Username>lawrenceronald13</Username><Timestamp>1359756012242</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 17:00:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359756213882-15</Id><Topic><Title>Surprise!...Shooting in Atlanta School was Gang Related...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1359754999819</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 16:43:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Eerily similar to an earlier incident, Skittles were found strewn across the playground.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1359756213882</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 17:03:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359757305376-16</Id><Topic><Title>Gun Fail 3</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1359752481123</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 16:01:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then tell me why we have to carry "UNINSURED MOTORIST" Insurance??????

(And now they are picked up for bail jumping - good thing they don't have a gun, but one got picked up for pulling a knife in a bar!!!) One of them got picked up when she drove her mothers pickup because that was proper insured and registered, but she still didn't have a valid license, her car sits parked in the driveway with lot's of snow on it! HOW DO YOU RELATE THAT TO HAVING A GUN??? The paper is full under "police report" with expired/no license, operating while in possession/intoxicated, no insurance, expired registration...........etc!
