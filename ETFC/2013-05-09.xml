And the "Reserve Bank of San Francisco" is contradicted by every bit of first hand evidence I've seen of people maxxing out their unemployment benefits, or even timing unemployment so they can get two tickets to the train with minimum extra hassle (employed labor). Unemployment checks are based on the highest earning working quarter within a given period before unemployment starts. I've seen at least one person get a job before the year of extended benefits was up, work long enough to qualify, then arrange to get himself let go so he could file again but with his benefits based on the higher salary of the job previous to the last for which he was already getting benefits. Sure, maybe he's not "typical" or "in the majority" or maybe it was all "just a coincidence" (just like several other cases of coincidentally convenient timing I've seen over the last 4 years), and certainly it isn't something that is a reason to end the unemployment program but . . . Right now the unemployment roles are kept low by people leaving the workforce permanently for SSDI, something that years and years ago only happened if you were obviously completely disabled, as in can't really do anything or be retrained. Now the sniffles are sometimes cause for a permanent disability determination (environmental allergies don't ya know). That's where our work force has been going, and that's' where a SIGNIFICANT future liability has roosted since those "workers" unlike other workers will never "retire" but rather go on collecting SSDI and whatever other benefits they're entitled to until they die.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368105486883</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:18:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368106194222-4</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary Arrested</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1368032373831</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 12:59:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only real crime she can be linked to is her addition to the DNC ticket in Illinois back during the 2007 Primary season. Benghazi wasn't a crime, it was just ignorance coupled with incompetence. Or at least it was in the beginning. Obama assumed the Libyan people and the Islamic Duma would just LOVE us for helping overthrow Gaddafi, without realizing that they'll never give us a second look until the Uma is restored to Dar Al Islam, meaning Israel is brought back under Muslim rule, no matter WHAT else we might do. So the consideration of "upsetting our allies" as an excuse to not bring in ready forces was just that, a political excuse. and THAT was the only "crime" here, one that the President and State Department are allowed to make because an assumption ignored at the heart of this is, that at the end of the day, everyone working for the national security apparatus, overtly or covertly, is expendable. It doesn't matter if they screwed up, or if the screwup took place many links above the command chain, they're still on the hook for it.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368106194222</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:29:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368106922733-5</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary Arrested</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1368032373831</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 12:59:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Old Timer, you should know that facts really upset these wingnutz.

What difference does it make?</Msg><Username>formykidsfuture</Username><Timestamp>1368132939238</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 16:55:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368132981406-26</Id><Topic><Title>New problem mortgage loan rates fell - ETFC owns $10B in mortgages, market cap is only $3B</Title><Username>mr_brightside_xy</Username><Timestamp>1367850665317</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:31:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I haven't spent 5 years around here for no stinking .60 cents.

Domestic Terrorists Teaching At Colleges? At least a dozen former members of domestic terrorist organizations are college professors, a guest blog on The Other McCain reports. The report comes on the heels of news that Kathy Boudin, the former American terrorist, is now a professor at Columbia and NYU. Boudin was convicted in a robbery that left two police officers dead in 1981. Apparently, she is not the only former domestic terrorist who now calls the Ivory Tower home: “Members of the Weather Underground make up half of this list; some are well known, like Bill Ayers and his wife Bernadine Dohrn, Ayers is now retired from the University of Illinois, while Dohrn is still teaching at Northwestern Law,” writes Ryan James Girdusky in a guest blog post Wednesday about the dozen or so former members of domestic terrorist organizations who are now college professors.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1368143296343</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:48:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368143849326-29</Id><Topic><Title>New problem mortgage loan rates fell - ETFC owns $10B in mortgages, market cap is only $3B</Title><Username>mr_brightside_xy</Username><Timestamp>1367850665317</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:31:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Indeed, 25 to 35 to 45. Incredible. This is a real pole. In any case, I am dealing with ETFC like with dead wood. I was stuck with them since 1995, and could not divorce them as all trading records would be removed if I leave them. Recently, I was selling puts on CY and CRUS. I sold like 200+ puts on CY, and decided to close them for a small profit prior to its drop - because ETFC was coming down below $10 to threaten my margin balance. I would say than ETCF drop to allow me to clear CY puts. I also sold 150+ contracts of puts on CRUS, rode it down to $18 something, and closed them all on the way up to 20-21. I should have let them all expire by next Monday. The gain from CY was like 2000, while the gain from CRUS was from 12000. I bought and closed ETFC by 3000, 5000, 10,000 shares for a few cents gain when it was between 9.75 to 10.44 because I was hanging this overhang of too many puts on CRUS, and was scared of CRUS continuing to drop down. This trading is indeed for the professionals on the Wall Street, not for a person like me.</Msg><Username>etfc2013</Username><Timestamp>1368143849326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:57:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368145000046-30</Id><Title>Hillary-Benghazi Super Lie 'The Video'</Title><Msg>Hillary pushes the Super-Lie that Benghazi happened because of 'The Video'...as she is standing next to the 4 dead Americans.

It will be harder to write-off loans as the value of homes improve. I expect provisions to start dropping at all banks. This has been the main drag on earnings for 5 years. The next leg up will be when interest rates on treasuries begin to increase. This may help SCHW more than us. The huge cash and assets these firms have can only be invested in low earning products. Once the NIM starts to rise there will be a rush to invest in all banks.</Msg><Username>gar4one</Username><Timestamp>1368146531532</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:42:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368148045548-35</Id><Topic><Title>Using surrogates to tell lies for him doesn't make Obama any less of a liar</Title><Username>robert_carr_donk</Username><Timestamp>1368146476509</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:41:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Idiot@large..

The problem with the stock market is it is now on a possibly last stage of the rally, the parabolic move stage, if the war in the Middle East does not flare up in the next 1-2 months, enough time to complete this parabolic move up. During this parabolic move, ETFC will touch $13. My biggest fear is that the U.S. enters the war against Iran through the back door at Syria. This will surely mess up the Wall Street party.</Msg><Username>etfc2013</Username><Timestamp>1368150444459</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 21:47:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368156268527-37</Id><Topic><Title>Housing improvement will help E-Trade and Banks</Title><Username>gar4one</Username><Timestamp>1368146531532</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:42:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so what you're saying is ........ it's a slow ride totally dependent upon the vagaries of the housing market.
