The process starts with the president submitting his budget request to Congress early in the year. That voluminous document is partly a presidential wish list, but it also gives Congress a framework. "The ‘PresBud,’ as it is called, forms the basis of the fiscal year budget that starts the following October," according to this post from the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. In Congress, the House and Senate have budget committees tasked with creating concurrent budget resolutions, using the president’s budget as a guide. As Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote, "The legislation they draft is for Congressional use only: it doesn't go to the President, it isn't law, it just helps Congress keep its budgetary ducks in a row." So there is the first problem with Romney’s statement. The president doesn’t "pass" a budget. That’s Congress’ job. In Obama’s case, he has submitted his budget request each year he has been in office. Voting on his requests Romney said in his speech that "In February, (Obama) put forward a proposal that included the largest tax increase in history and still left our national debt spiraling out of control, and the House rejected it unanimously." He’s right about the rejection. After Obama submitted his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal on Feb. 13, 2012, House Republicans put it up for a floor vote. The result: 414-0 against. The same thing happened a year earlier in the Senate. That vote: 97-0 against. Democrats didn’t support the plan because it has been supplanted by another deficit-reduction plan Obama had later outlined. Republican leaders demanded a vote on Obama’s budget to show that Democrats don’t support any detailed budget blueprint, according to The Hill. Such votes are taken "just as a means of embarrassing the president and his party," said Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Usually it’s brought up by the opposition party because they generally anticipate that a president’s budget won’t get very much support especially if it has controversial elements to it," he said. Other experts agree. Said Steve Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense: "That was pure political theater and was done to score rhetorical points." And Norman Ornstein, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, "it doesn’t mean a damn thing. It’s only a symbolic gesture." These votes are also what Romney’s campaign cited when we asked for documentation of his statement. "Everyone understands that the president has a unique and important role in facilitating that process," said spokesman Ryan Williams in an email. "President Obama has been an unprecedented failure in that respect. His FY 2012 budget went down 97-0 in the Senate and his FY 2013 budget went down 414-0 in the House." Speaking of precedent We wondered what other budgetary scenarios have played out recently. Knudsen pointed to 2009, when Democrats still held a majority in the House. They introduced a resolution that included the mechanism for the health care legislation championed by Obama in his budget. The resolution had many elements of the president’s budget, Knudsen said, though it wasn’t strictly speaking that document. Ornstein referred us to the gridlock of 2011 that resulted from the debate over raising the debt ceiling. The budget control act, which was passed to avoid a default on our debt and signed by Obama wasn’t a traditional budget resolution, Ornstein said. But he noted: "That was actually a budget adopted by a president." Ornstein also noted that during George W. Bush’s presidency, there were years that Democrats in Congress failed to pass joint resolutions. "To suggest that was Bush not passing a budget would be a misstatement," Ornstein said. He called Romney’s rap on Obama "at best a gross exaggeration." But in Knudsen’s view, Romney’s statement was "technically accurate." "The president’s budgets have been brought to the floor twice and they have failed," Knudsen said. "It’s not atypical that that should happen, but nevertheless the governor is correct." PolitiFact has examined similar accusations about a lack of budgeting when they’ve been leveled at Congress. In January 2012, Republican House member Paul Ryan charged that Senate Democrats "have gone without any budget at all" for more than 1,000 days. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated that Mostly True, finding he was slightly off about the number of days but correct that the Democrat-controlled Senate had gone a long time with passing a budget resolution. Former Louisiana Congressman and Gov. Buddy Roemer earned a Half True from us when he said in July 2011 that "Obama has never submitted a budget, and Congress has worked for two years without passing one." He was right about Congress but wrong about Obama. Our ruling In his speech, Romney faulted Obama for failing to pass a budget. He was correct that the two times Congress voted on the president’s budget requests, both times they were voted down. But the job of passing a budget resolution is not the president’s. That responsibility falls to Congress, and even then the president doesn’t sign it. As Ellis, our expert, put it: "The president has no role in passing a budget. The president can cajole Congress about passing a budget and advocate for positions and funding levels, but in the end, Congress approves the budget resolution for their own purposes." That’s the difference between this and other claims we’ve rated which blamed Congress for inaction on the budget. Romney’s statement contains a grain of truth, in that two of Obama’s budget requests failed to pass. But citing those votes leaves a wrong impression -- namely that the votes were anything more than political theater. Romney omitted the more critical information that passing a federal budget is the job of Congress. Given all that, we rate his statement Mostly False."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349448003057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:40:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349448844285-13</Id><Title>Dumbo: Where's the 'BUDGET"???</Title><Msg>Its your DAMN job!!

In the clip, as Romney approached the podium, he took something white or off-white out of his right pants pocket and placed it on the podium before the start of the debate. According to the Commission on Presidential Debate rules, candidates are not allowed to bring notes to the podium. Democrats and progressives who already think the worst of Romney believe that the clip is evidence that he cheated; Republicans are scoffing at the premise. At least once during the debate, towards the end, Romney wiped the sweat off his upper lip with a handkerchief, before his closing statement, and the candidate didn’t appear to be looking down at the podium as much as President Barack Obama was.

While Mitt Romney still enjoys the afterglow of the debate, the lies and half truths he told are being dissected. From tax policy to hiring teachers. From cracking down on Wall Street (and Sesame Street) to coverage for the uninsured. From Medicare to shipping jobs overseas the fact checkers have been very busy correcting the record and pointing out falsehoods. Even Team Romney had to correct the candidate on health care immediately after the debate. As I predicted earlier this week, Romney had an October Surprise planned for the President – new policy ideas. But I had no idea that Romney would just lie about everything he had said over the past year and a half. As the President said, Mitt Romney’s bright new idea is: Never Mind! But there was a moment in the debate that will be discussed in the days ahead that everyone missed until yesterday. A review of the debate tape reveals that, apparently, Mitt Romney needed a cheat sheet to keep the lies straight. The rules of the presidential debates are clear about not bringing outside notes and presidents and aspirants have followed the rule for decades. Video of the first eleven seconds of the debate available on YouTube shows Mitt Romney reaching into his pocket at the moment he is out of view of those in front of him, he used the lectern as a shield, and removing what appears to be folded papers from his pocket. We see this because the camera that was broadcasting was behind Romney. Those in the audience and the moderator may have been shielded from his sleight of hand, but not the viewers. Romney then proceeds to unfold the item in front of him. For those curious if it could have been some else, later video sheds some light on what Romney retrieves from his lectern. After the Romney and Obama families chat post-debate the President walks off stage, leaving his notes behind for an aide, no doubt. But not so for Romney. The Presidential challenger goes back to his lectern to retrieve his items. It is clear that the only thing that Romney takes is paper. Not a handkerchief. Not a white flag. Nothing but paper. So the next question is: what is Mitt Romney’s explanation for the apparent cheating?</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349459726634</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 13:55:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349460022688-32</Id><Topic><Title>Without the Teleprompter</Title><Username>leftie_weezner</Username><Timestamp>1349444996637</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 09:49:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I imagine those were the notes we was taking while Obama was speaking, as were some of Obama's notes.

Paul Broun (R-GA) tore into scientists as tools of the devil in a speech at the Liberty Baptist Church Sportsman’s Banquet last month. “All that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang Theory, all that is lies straight from the pit of Hell,” Broun said. “And it’s lies to try to keep me and all the folks who were taught that from understanding that they need a savior.” According to Broun, the scientific plot was primarily concerned with hiding the true age of the Earth. Broun serves on the House Science Committee, which came under scrutiny recently after another one of its Republican members, Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO), suggested that victims of “legitimate rape” have unnamed biological defenses against pregnancy. “You see, there are a lot of scientific data that I’ve found out as a scientist that actually show that this is really a young Earth,” he said. “I don’t believe that the Earth’s but about 9,000 years old.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) A new Rasmussen poll and early absentee ballot requests both suggest that President Barack Obama is losing his lead in Ohio after Mitt Romney’s performance in Wednesday night’s presidential debate. A post-debate poll revealed Obama and Romney are essentially tied in Ohio, with just one percentage point separating the candidates. Earlier polls had shown Obama leading by up to eight points. According to county data retrieved by the conservative nonprofit American Majority Action and reviewed by The Daily Caller, early absentee ballot requests also indicate Obama faces a tough battle in Ohio. Compared to 2008, a higher percentage of Republicans have requested absentee ballots in the five largest counties in Ohio this year. Summit County saw a particularly large 27-point increase. “Polls can be manipulated—real votes can’t,” AMA president Ned Ryun said in a statement. So far, Ohioans have requested just over half the amount of ballots they did in 2008. “So far, although it is early, the overall across-the-board direction of every single county in Ohio seems to be not just challenging the pollsters’ template that Obama is widening his lead, but is obliterating it,” Dr. Larry Schweikart, professor at the University of Dayton and New York Times bestselling author, told AMA. “Given Ohio’s voting history, if the numbers are even close after early voting, Obama will lose, and possibly lose big,” Schweikart said. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has removed 450,000 deceased voters and duplicate registrations from the voter rolls in advance of the November election — the majority of them registered Democrats.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349466339396</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:45:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349466467600-40</Id><Topic><Title>Leaderless one losing lead in "OIHO" learn more...</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349466339396</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:45:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a word: Brak is overrated and overestimated</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349466467600</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:47:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349466468197-41</Id><Topic><Title>Leaderless one losing lead in "OIHO" learn more...</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349466339396</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:45:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a word: Brak is overrated and overestimated</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349466468197</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 15:47:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349467579464-42</Id><Title>The year was 1900 and six</Title><Msg>Bef Warren's great grampa reportedly plugged him a native merkin.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349467579464</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 16:06:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349467885471-43</Id><Topic><Title>The year was 1900 and six</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349467579464</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 16:06:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bef needs to axe herself if she's better off now or if she was better off a hundred and six years ago when great grampa bagged him a native.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349467885471</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 16:11:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349469994411-44</Id><Topic><Title>7.8% ........... 7.8% .............

There are still over 12 million Americans unemployed today! With 4.8 million of those Americans having been unemployed for more than 27 weeks. For many, the American Dream is disappearing. Our economy is being stifled by the big spending and over-regulation of the Obama Administration’s policies.

Farrell | MarketWatch – Tue, Aug 10, 2010 "How my G.O.P. destroyed the U.S. economy." Yes, that is exactly what David Stockman, President Ronald Reagan's director of the Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a recent New York Times op-ed piece, "Four Deformations of the Apocalypse." Get it? Not "destroying." The GOP has already "destroyed" the U.S. economy, setting up an "American Apocalypse." This indictment by a party insider -- someone so close to the development of the Reaganomics ideology -- says about America, helps all of us better understand how America's toxic partisan-politics "holy war" is destroying not just the economy and capitalism, but the America dream. And unless this war stops soon, both parties will succeed in their collective death wish. But why focus on Stockman's message? It's already lost in the 24/7 news cycle. Why? We need some introspection. Ask yourself: How did the great nation of America lose its moral compass and drift so far off course, to where our very survival is threatened? We've arrived at a historic turning point as a nation that no longer needs outside enemies to destroy us, we are committing suicide. Democracy. Capitalism. The American dream. All dying. Why? Because of the economic decisions of the GOP the past 40 years, says this leading Reagan Republican. Please listen with an open mind, no matter your party affiliation: This makes for a powerful history lesson, because it exposes how both parties are responsible for destroying the U.S. economy. Listen closely: Reagan Republican: the GOP should file for bankruptcy Stockman rushes into the ring swinging like a boxer: "If there were such a thing as Chapter 11 for politicians, the Republican push to extend the unaffordable Bush tax cuts would amount to a bankruptcy filing. The nation's public debt ... will soon reach $18 trillion." It screams "out for austerity and sacrifice." But instead, the GOP insists "that the nation's wealthiest taxpayers be spared even a three-percentage-point rate increase." In the past 40 years Republican ideology has gone from solid principles to hype and slogans. Stockman says: "Republicans used to believe that prosperity depended upon the regular balancing of accounts -- in government, in international trade, on the ledgers of central banks and in the financial affairs of private households and businesses too." No more. Today there's a "new catechism" that's "little more than money printing and deficit finance, vulgar Keynesianism robed in the ideological vestments of the prosperous classes" making a mockery of GOP ideals. Worse, it has resulted in "serial financial bubbles and Wall Street depredations that have crippled our economy." Yes, GOP ideals backfired, crippling our economy. Stockman's indictment warns that the Republican party's "new policy doctrines have caused four great deformations of the national economy, and modern Republicans have turned a blind eye to each one:" Stage 1. Nixon irresponsible, dumps gold, U.S starts spending binge Richard Nixon's gold policies get Stockman's first assault, for defaulting "on American obligations under the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement to balance our accounts with the world." So for the past 40 years, America's been living "beyond our means as a nation" on "borrowed prosperity on an epic scale ... an outcome that Milton Friedman said could never happen when, in 1971, he persuaded President Nixon to unleash on the world paper dollars no longer redeemable in gold or other fixed monetary reserves." Remember Friedman: "Just let the free market set currency exchange rates, he said, and trade deficits will self-correct." Friedman was wrong by trillions. And unfortunately "once relieved of the discipline of defending a fixed value for their currencies, politicians the world over were free to cheapen their money and disregard their neighbors." And without discipline America was also encouraging "global monetary chaos as foreign central banks run their own printing presses at ever faster speeds to sop up the tidal wave of dollars coming from the Federal Reserve." Yes, the road to the coming apocalypse began with a Republican president listening to a misguided Nobel economist's advice. Stage 2. Crushing debts from domestic excesses, war mongering Stockman says "the second unhappy change in the American economy has been the extraordinary growth of our public debt. In 1970 it was just 40% of gross domestic product, or about $425 billion. When it reaches $18 trillion, it will be 40 times greater than in 1970." Who's to blame? Not big-spending Dems, says Stockman, but "from the Republican Party's embrace, about three decades ago, of the insidious doctrine that deficits don't matter if they result from tax cuts." Back "in 1981, traditional Republicans supported tax cuts," but Stockman makes clear, they had to be "matched by spending cuts, to offset the way inflation was pushing many taxpayers into higher brackets and to spur investment. The Reagan administration's hastily prepared fiscal blueprint, however, was no match for the primordial forces -- the welfare state and the warfare state -- that drive the federal spending machine." OK, stop a minute. As you absorb Stockman's indictment of how his Republican party has "destroyed the U.S. economy," you're probably asking yourself why anyone should believe a traitor to the Reagan legacy. I believe party affiliation is irrelevant here. This is a crucial subject that must be explored because it further exposes a dangerous historical trend where politics is so partisan it's having huge negative consequences. Yes, the GOP does have a welfare-warfare state: Stockman says "the neocons were pushing the military budget skyward. And the Republicans on Capitol Hill who were supposed to cut spending, exempted from the knife most of the domestic budget -- entitlements, farm subsidies, education, water projects. But in the end it was a new cadre of ideological tax-cutters who killed the Republicans' fiscal religion." When Fed chief Paul Volcker "crushed inflation" in the '80s we got a "solid economic rebound." But then "the new tax-cutters not only claimed victory for their supply-side strategy but hooked Republicans for good on the delusion that the economy will outgrow the deficit if plied with enough tax cuts." By 2009, they "reduced federal revenues to 15% of gross domestic product," lowest since the 1940s. Still today they're irrationally demanding an extension of those "unaffordable Bush tax cuts [that] would amount to a bankruptcy filing." Recently Bush made matters far worse by "rarely vetoing a budget bill and engaging in two unfinanced foreign military adventures." Bush also gave in "on domestic spending cuts, signing into law $420 billion in nondefense appropriations, a 65% percent gain from the $260 billion he had inherited eight years earlier. Republicans thus joined the Democrats in a shameless embrace of a free-lunch fiscal policy." Takes two to tango. Stage 3. Wall Street's deadly 'vast, unproductive expansion' Stockman continues pounding away: "The third ominous change in the American economy has been the vast, unproductive expansion of our financial sector." He warns that "Republicans have been oblivious to the grave danger of flooding financial markets with freely printed money and, at the same time, removing traditional restrictions on leverage and speculation." Wrong, not oblivious. Self-interested Republican loyalists like Paulson, Bernanke and Geithner knew exactly what they were doing. They wanted the economy, markets and the government to be under the absolute control of Wall Street's too-greedy-to-fail banks. They conned Congress and the Fed into bailing out an estimated $23.7 trillion debt. Worse, they have since destroyed meaningful financial reforms. So Wall Street is now back to business as usual blowing another bigger bubble/bust cycle that will culminate in the coming "American Apocalypse." Stockman refers to Wall Street's surviving banks as "wards of the state." Wrong, the opposite is true. Wall Street now controls Washington, and its "unproductive" trading is "extracting billions from the economy with a lot of pointless speculation in stocks, bonds, commodities and derivatives." Wall Street banks like Goldman were virtually bankrupt, would have never survived without government-guaranteed deposits and "virtually free money from the Fed's discount window to cover their bad bets." Stage 4. New American Revolution class warfare coming soon Finally, thanks to Republican policies that let us "live beyond our means for decades by borrowing heavily from abroad, we have steadily sent jobs and production offshore," while at home "high-value jobs in goods production ... trade, transportation, information technology and the professions shrunk by 12% to 68 million from 77 million." As the apocalypse draws near, Stockman sees a class-rebellion, a new revolution, a war against greed and the wealthy. Soon. The trigger will be the growing gap between economic classes: No wonder "that during the last bubble (from 2002 to 2006) the top 1% of Americans -- paid mainly from the Wall Street casino -- received two-thirds of the gain in national income, while the bottom 90% -- mainly dependent on Main Street's shrinking economy -- got only 12%. This growing wealth gap is not the market's fault. It's the decaying fruit of bad economic policy." Get it? The decaying fruit of the GOP's bad economic policies is destroying our economy. Warning: This black swan won't be pretty, will shock, soon His bottom line: "The day of national reckoning has arrived. We will not have a conventional business recovery now, but rather a long hangover of debt liquidation and downsizing ... it's a pity that the modern Republican party offers the American people an irrelevant platform of recycled Keynesianism when the old approach -- balanced budgets, sound money and financial discipline -- is needed more than ever." Wrong: There are far bigger things to "pity." First, that most Americans, 300 million, are helpless, will do nothing, sit in the bleachers passively watching this deadly partisan game like it's just another TV reality show. Second, that, unfortunately, politicians are so deep-in-the-pockets of the Wall Street conspiracy that controls Washington they are helpless and blind. And third, there's a depressing sense that Stockman will be dismissed as a traitor, his message lost in the 24/7 news cycle ... until the final apocalyptic event, an unpredictable black swan triggers another, bigger global meltdown, followed by a long Great Depression II and a historic class war. So be prepared, it will hit soon, when you least expect</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349478078801</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 19:01:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349481078709-54</Id><Topic><Title>ANOTHER IGNORANT REDNECK</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349463363328</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 14:56:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean like you follow Rush ?</Msg><Username>lonelygaybillie</Username><Timestamp>1349481078709</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 19:51:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349482363171-55</Id><Topic><Title>7.8% ........... 7.8% .............

A panel of three judges from the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday affirmed a lower court's ruling in August blocking the law from taking effect. The Obama presidential campaign and the Democratic Party had sued the state, asking a federal court to restore voting during those last three days on the grounds that Ohioans would not have equal access to the polls otherwise. The law allowed military families to vote over that period. The lawsuit argued that everyone should be allowed the same access. Ohio Republican leaders insisted that their only motivation was to make things easier for election administrators. But in their ruling the three judges wrote that the state's "proffered interest in smooth election administration" was not sufficiently weighty to justify the voting regulation. The ruling questioned Ohio's stated motivation, noting that the lower court heard evidence to the contrary. "Ohio’s most populous county, Cuyahoga County, asserted that maintaining in-person early voting would actually alleviate some of its burden by spreading out the demand for voting over more days, thus reducing lines and wait times at polling places on Election Day." During the three days before Election Day in 2008, about 105,000 ballots were cast in Ohio, many of them prompted by a "souls to the polls" push from black churches. The early voting period in Ohio began this week -- 35 days before the election -- but not with times convenient to working people. The appellate court judges described as "worrisome" a scenario in which "states were permitted to pick and choose among groups of similarly situated voters to dole out special voting privileges. Partisan state legislatures could give extra early voting time to groups that traditionally support the party in power and impose corresponding burdens on the other party’s core constituents." Friday's ruling is the latest in a series of court decisions that have gone against wide-ranging attempts by Republicans to change voting laws in ways that tend to suppress Democratic votes. The practical effects of the ruling are still very much in the air, however. Republican Secretary of State John Husted had refused to restore those three days of early voting after the lower court decision. And the appellate court decision expressly leaves the final decision about whether to keep the polls open or not on those days to individual county elections boards. Those election boards have two members each from either party -- and the Republican secretary of state is the tiebreaker if necessary. So it's easy to envision a scenario in which Husted still blocks voting on those three days in predominantly urban and Democratic counties. Husted's office gave no indication of its next step when contacted by The Huffington Post. "Really at this point in time, we're reviewing the case," said Matt McClellan, Husted's press secretary. "There will be no action today [Friday] or this weekend."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349487215348</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:33:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349487626168-58</Id><Title>More foreign influence for GOP votes, campaign cash for favorable tax policy</Title><Msg>As the Dems and Justice Ginsburg warned, Citizens United will open our elections to ever growing foreign influence.

A million-dollar donation by a foreign-owned corporation to a Republican super-PAC has raised legal concerns and opened up the controversial Citizens United Supreme Court decision to new criticism. Restore Our Future, the super-PAC supporting Republican Mitt Romney's run for president, received a $1 million donation in mid-August from reinsurance company OdysseyRe of Connecticut, a "wholly-owned subsidiary" of Canadian insurance and investment management giant Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited. Fairfax Financial's founder is Indian-born V. Prem Watsa. Watsa serves as CEO and chairman and owns or controls 45 percent of the company's shares. He is also the chairman of the board of OdysseyRe, the American subsidiary. The law says that any foreign national is prohibited from "directly or indirectly" contributing money to influence US elections. That means no campaign donations, no donations to super-PACs, and no funding of political advertisements. -snip- The company is the subject of an IRS whistleblower's complaint, according to the New York Times, alleging that it received an unwarranted tax break of $400 million between 2003 and 2006, a claim Fairfax disputes. The $1 million donation will likely be used for attack ads against President Barack Obama. And with less than five weeks until Election Day, $1 million is no insignificant amount. It's enough to buy at least a week or two's worth of ads in critical media markets. It also represents one-seventh of the money Restore Our Future collected in August. Lovell said the company decided to donate because it favors Romney's stance on tax policy.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349487626168</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:40:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349487635225-59</Id><Title>More foreign influence for GOP votes, campaign cash for favorable tax policy</Title><Msg>As the Dems and Justice Ginsburg warned, Citizens United will open our elections to ever growing foreign influence.
