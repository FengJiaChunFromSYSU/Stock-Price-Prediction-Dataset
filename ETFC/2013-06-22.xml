And to add to the amazement he did it ALL without striking back until the LAST second. Very clever of him using his Jedi Mind Tricks to "force" Martin to attack him.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1371913143079</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 10:59:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371917690897-2</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting NSA surveillance twist</Title><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1371821926742</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 09:38:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Once Zim left his car he became the "proximate cause" of Martin's death. To what degree is the jury's decision.

You see, for MOST people assault is considered a felony. A violent felony at that. Sure, not a death penalty offense, but what if it wasn't just an assault but attempted murder? Either way that was the first actual CRIME committed, and therefore was the cause of the shooting. No matter what comes out of someone's mouth, assuming something did, it's not reason to punch someone out.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1371928631333</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 15:17:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371929906472-4</Id><Topic><Title>Interesting NSA surveillance twist</Title><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1371821926742</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 09:38:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Zimmerman was unarmed, he would at this moment be sitting in a nursing home pooping in his Depends.</Msg><Username>homie_dont_join_nra</Username><Timestamp>1371929906472</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-22 15:38:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371930864242-5</Id><Title>I see 2 scenarios here</Title><Msg>Survive and thrive or get taken out by a bigger player at around 6B.
