And remember how the Republicans got their panties in a wad about it? "I am disturbed and personally offended by the Department of Homeland Security's view that returning military veterans and gun owners are likely to commit terrorist acts," said Gus Bilirakis (R-FL). Said the DHS Report, "The consequences of a prolonged economic downturn—including real estate foreclosures, unemployment, and an inability to obtain credit—could create a fertile recruiting environment for rightwing extremists and even result in confrontations between such groups and government authorities similar to those in the past." So Republican policies of easy access to firearms AND the Republican policy of keeping the economy in the toilet for as long as possible might - just might - lead to incidents were individuals who are already mentally unstable might be pushed over the edge. And if these persons were former military, there could be dangerous consequences. I'm so terribly sorry that Rep. Bilirakis had his tender feelings hurt. Really. So terribly shocked that something as horrible as that could happen.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344266462000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 11:21:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344266930000-12</Id><Topic><Title>Shooter was a Right Wing Skin Head</Title><Username>chuckiedamanson</Username><Timestamp>1344263742000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 10:35:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right wing crazy, Left wing crazy, It really does not matter - the problem is with the number of guns out there.

They don’t know what they're talking about, Pelosi says. "Harry Reid made a statement that is true. Somebody told him. It is a fact," Pelosi told The Huffington Post in a Sunday interview. "Whether he did or not can easily be disposed of: Mitt Romney can release his tax returns and show whether he paid taxes." Both Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus came out swinging against Reid on Sunday over his claims about Romney potentially not paying taxes. Asked to respond to Priebus calling Reid "a dirty liar" over the situation, Pelosi initially responded, "Who?" She went on to say that Priebus doesn't know what he's talking about since he wasn't part of Reid's conversations. "Well he doesn't know that," Pelosi said. "Harry Reid is a person who is, as we know, A, is a fighter, B, he wouldn't say this unless it was true that somebody told him that."</Msg><Username>topgun_0476</Username><Timestamp>1344275756000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 13:55:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344276090000-36</Id><Topic><Title>Etrade Will Get a Slice of Knights Business</Title><Username>hammerstein_klondike</Username><Timestamp>1344259880000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 09:31:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That 120 mill drops to the bottom line once they are acquired.

According to the department, Gibson entered a "criminal enforcement agreement" resolving the investigation. The federal government will not charge Gibson, but the company has apparently agreed to pay a $300,000 penalty, pay $50,000 to a federal conservation fund and withdraw claims to the valuable fingerboards that were seized in a series of federal raids. "This criminal enforcement agreement goes a long way in demonstrating the government's commitment to protecting the world's natural resources," U.S. Attorney Jerry Martin said in a statement. Gibson has not yet issued a statement on the agreement.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344279315000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 14:55:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344279346000-51</Id><Title>Let's Go Pansies...I Got ALL Day!...</Title><Msg>You little Warts on Society have to face Reality Soon!...

Reid’s spokesman: Republicans forced to defend "the most secretive candidate since Richard Nixon" Last edited Sun Aug 5, 2012, 02:50 PM USA/ET - Edit history (2) &lt;...&gt; Late Sunday morning, Reid’s spokesman Adam Jentleson responded via email to TPM. “Republicans can try to cover up for Mitt Romney’s stonewalling all they want, but this issue is not going away until Romney decides to be straight with the American people and release his tax returns. It is sad that the most secretive candidate since Richard Nixon has forced his party to defend his decision to hide the truth about his tax returns. As Senator Reid has said, an extremely credible source informed him that Mitt Romney did not pay taxes for ten years. From the one year of returns Romney has released, we’ve seen that he uses secret offshore accounts in places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands to avoid paying U.S. taxes. It’s clear Mitt Romney is hiding something, and the only way for him to clear this up is to be straight with the American people and release his tax returns.”</Msg><Username>spenditol98_1</Username><Timestamp>1344309978000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 23:26:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344310006000-129</Id><Topic><Title>I didnt see those a-holes crying at the</Title><Username>hardbrownbone</Username><Timestamp>1344306807000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-06 22:33:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good lord, you are such an ignorant bigot that you think those folks were somehow connected to 911.
