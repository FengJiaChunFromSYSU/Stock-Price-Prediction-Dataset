"The truth is that in prior years, Social Security taxes collected from workers added up to more than the amount of benefits paid to retirees. This buildup of surplus was intentional -- the government wanted to build a reserve that would cover the benefits of the baby boomers." "the federal government has borrowed all of that trust fund money and spent it" SPENT IT ON AN UNFUNDED WAR IN IRAQ.

This is a very dangerous situation for investors ! You can hope to sell in a near short term , but not a big profit , after that stock will decline ! Citigroup will be selling shares of ETFC to the public and selling short to prepare for a decline ! In fact they already prepared for that decline in advance run up of 32 % in the stock price !

Their actions would have been more effective at keeping the price down if they'd waiting until AFTER earnings to do it. At least this way we have an upcoming even which may either lend us a boost, or hammer us into the sand.
