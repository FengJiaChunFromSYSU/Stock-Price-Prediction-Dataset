Mitt didn't and doesn't speak for whole Republican party, he was never a party leader either. You're confusing political campaign tricks for someone who never represented true conservatism with GOP platform. Deliberately! Defense is here to protect us. It may help economy as well, but we are in deep trouble if economy becomes defense's primary purpose. Never was, never should be. Find a true GOP spokesman to support your clam, like Paul, Rubio, Cruz, Mike Lee.

Selling the product takes very long time and that doesn't reduce debt because profit from selling goes to private energy producers, not government. So what is this author's suggestion? Nationalize energy resources like Hugo Chavez did? Just can't wait to destroy another industry, like they doing to healthcare, Post Office and Amtrak? Government is good at screwing things up, I have little doubt they will do exactly that. That wouldn't have much chance to succeed paying the debt either.

In their efforts to disenfranchise tackle that ever-so crushing 0.0002 percent problem of voter fraud (equivalent to the number of UFO sightings and the money spent on House Speaker Boehner’s tanning bed solution), the GOP finally nailed one of those sneaky, derelict voters. Never-mind that the guilty party is an 86-year-old woman with dementia, who says she forgot she had already sent in her absentee ballot when she went to her polling place in November. Whip out the Mission Accomplished banner and send this octogenarian to Gitmo! Margaret Schneider, an 86-year-old woman suffering with dementia, mistakenly voted twice in the 2012 primary elections: once by absentee ballot on July 13 and then again on election day, Aug. 14. “It’s very hard to remember everything,” said Schneider. Adding, “I’ve always voted, ever since I’ve been old enough to,” she said. (Fox News) That’s precisely what these old dementia suffers want us to think; they use their silly degenerative neurological disorders as an excuse to break the law and make Karl Rove and #$%$ Morris upset. Before you know it, she’ll be saying she accidentally stole batteries for her way too expensive medical device that Medicare won’t reimburse. The Nicollet County Attorney’s Office is charging Margaret with voting twice during the 2012 election, according to the Mankato Free Press. Schneider, who now recounts the innocent mix-up (or so she wants us to think since being paid off by the Kenya Socialist’s Chicago goons), feels she shouldn’t have been allowed to vote twice in their first place. “It had been awhile and I didn’t even remember. I was shocked to death because I thought my absentee ballot was for the president,” Schneider told the paper. “I think if I’m convicted, they should be convicted too. They knew I had voted already, so they shouldn’t have let me vote.” (Huffington Post).

Oh well. the fact is: Debt, Deficits, and Demographics: Why We Can Afford the Social Contract November 2012, Dean Baker The emphasis on budget deficits in national policy debates over the last three decades has badly distorted national priorities. There has been an enormous amount of fundamentally confused thinking on budget deficits that has made its way into mainstream political debates. This paper shows that the potential harm from budget deficits has been seriously misrepresented and it is implausible that future generations of workers will see a decline in living standards due to the effects of an aging population................ The first section of this paper discusses the economy’s recent growth and projected future growth. It compares the projected gains from continued growth and contrasts these with the impact of an aging population. Under any plausible scenario, the benefits from growth will swamp any negative impact on living standards from an aging population. The second section examines how deficits can pose a drain on the economy. Specifically, it will point out the distinction between a deficit when the economy is near full employment and a deficit run when the economy has a large number of unemployed workers and a large amount of excess capacity. In the latter case, there is really no way that the deficit can be seen as imposing a drain on the economy. In fact, deficits in the latter case are likely to increase the well-being of future generations.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1363035638644</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 17:00:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363036202239-28</Id><Topic><Title>When was the last time this thing was over 12??</Title><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1363033641644</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:27:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nothing new here.

In the USA there is ONE party trying to tell its citizens what to do with their bodies in regards to child bearing. Republicans want to force people to have children and then NOT help poor people feed\cloth\doctor these children. Dems want people to have a CHOICE if they want children or not, AND want to help poor people feed\cloth\doctor these children. and what party is closer to facism? what party is corrupt in their supposed morality?</Msg><Username>sec_fordummies</Username><Timestamp>1363037227481</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 17:27:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363038038920-30</Id><Topic><Title>True Aim of Deficit Scare-Mongering: To Gut Social Security and Medicare</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1363035638644</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 17:00:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Projected growth 4 years ago was above 3%. Someone made a mistake in projection. Can you tell me what was projected unemployment rate 4 years ago? Did they predict 7.7%(12% real one) at the time? Another mistake in projection. Sounds like manufactured pattern. It smells bad. I bet they will project a pile of gold for everyone in America to distract them from #$%$ right under their feet today. Yeah, Obamaphones help that too. The debt is already huge. And the deficit which isn't getting any smaller makes the picture even scarier. Can you start living in the real world, not in the fantasy land? Not a chance? Look, convincing young and uneducated that their financial future is secure all while we continue going down the drain is nothing less than criminal. All while you #$%$ sitting here eating their money and posting your garbage.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1363038038920</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 17:40:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363038911942-31</Id><Topic><Title>BO the Conqueror</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363033520586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 16:25:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Budget deficit can't be passed 4 years forward.

Biden apologized after for no "recovery summer". Didn't happen. Not summer, not winter, not spring nor fall in the following years. It was pathetic. It still is. "from 2010 through 2013, the administration assumes that real GDP will grow at a 4% annual rate. To put this in perspective, that is twice as fast as the economy's 2% annual rate of growth between 2004 and 2008." Sure, make excuses for doofuses who didn't have full picture at the time. DON'T MAKE FALSE PREDICTIONS. No one on conservative side would believe them. Why? Unrealistic. Now, what you will never learn is that GDP can be severely hurt, but it doesn't affect future GDP growth. Those are different things. Crushed GDP in early 2009 can be addressed to Bush's term. But dismal GDP growth years later is 100% Obama's. Yet you still didn't give up on Bush . Obama team stopped making predictions. Thanks! But some worshipers still continue making false assumptions, and idiots right here on this board would take them as given fact.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1363043812362</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-11 19:16:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363044264867-39</Id><Title>Signal for a correction</Title><Msg>Vix 52 week low @$11.56.
