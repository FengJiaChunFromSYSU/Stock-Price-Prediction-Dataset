No one at that moment knew where the attack was coming from. Those 7 minutes wouldn't affect a darn thing. 3 days later W was standing with megaphone on the rubles of WTC still in smoke: "I can hear you! I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you! And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon! Rescue Workers: [Chanting] U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!" That's was the most important thing that country needed at the time. 11 years later, another president hears about attack on consulate in Benghazi, he is informed exactly what happened, but gives no meaningful instructions and goes to bed. Next day in the Rose Garden he blames attack on #$%$ Mohammed video and takes off to Vegas for money raising. 6 weeks later, during 2nd debate he falsely claims that in Rose Garden he called it a terrorist attack in front of tens of millions viewers. And gets no blame neither for letting fellow Americans to die, nor for the further chain of lies. There were dozens of witnesses who managed to escape the attack. But none of them can be found for testimony. It's KGB tactics. Said story is that most of Obama voters don't even know what's KGB.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1369123465647</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 04:04:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369127142035-3</Id><Topic><Title>When Bush Learned of 9/11, He Continued Reading His Book</Title><Username>biddermoron_ca</Username><Timestamp>1369101916774</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 22:05:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Russia could have launched an all out strike on us and he STILL would have had time to finish the book with about 15 minutes to spare. There's only so much a President can do immediately, and when faced with a situation that evokes that many emotions and changes that many variables to be seen continuing to read was far preferable to the likely alternative of totally losing it and freezing or freaking while on camera. You know, like if he'd pretended the problem didn't exist while planes hit New York for 8 hours, when he could have put fighters in the air with a word. Big difference between taking time like 7 minutes to gather your thoughts and time like 8 hours.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1369127142035</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 05:05:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369129280705-4</Id><Topic><Title>When Bush Learned of 9/11, He Continued Reading His Book</Title><Username>biddermoron_ca</Username><Timestamp>1369101916774</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 22:05:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You guys are kidding right?

It is also possible to estimate how many Mitt Romney and Barack Obama voters would have been audited last year. The calculation assumes that an individual’s chance of being audited was related to their income, but not to their political views. I estimate the number of voters in each income bracket from the 2012 Current Population Survey. I then estimate the share of the vote in each income bracket that went to Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama based on last year’s national exit poll. (Note that the income brackets used in the exit poll and the Current Population Survey do not exactly match the income brackets listed in the I.R.S.’s audit data, so I use the closest available approximations.) This results in an estimate that about 380,000 of Mr. Romney’s voters were audited last year, as were about 480,000 of Mr. Obama’s voters. It’s almost like the IRS audits low-income Americans far more than the wealthy because there are far more low-income Americans to audit, and they are much more likely to receive a refund from the government, and that these low-income Americans are primarily Obama voters. It’s also almost like Peggy Noonan found a couple people who had been audited and concluded, without any evidence whatsoever, that they had been deliberately targeted because of their political views, and that she then dismissed every other possible explanation for the audits. And then Nate Silver came along and said “Wow, this woman is insane, TO THE NATE CAVE” and then squished her. Then he probably had a tasty beverage.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369162617163</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 14:56:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369164498871-47</Id><Topic><Title>we are the same: unluckyspankerbill and unluckyskunkergerbil.......</Title><Username>unluckyspankerbill</Username><Timestamp>1369155512236</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 12:58:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He wouldn't be laughing if he knew what the evenings entertainment lineup is bringing . . . or maybe it is that he's laughing because he knows and its maniacal?

Real Clear Politics was the first to report that Palin — who reportedly signed a $1 million-a-year contract with the network in 2010 — will not be renewing it. The New York Times' Brian Stelter later confirmed the news with Fox News. A "source close to Palin" told RCP that she had turned down a new offer. Fox News merely told the New York Times in a statement that it wished her the best. The news is not very surprising, but it does highlight, as much as anything, Palin's diminished relevance. Reports about the increasingly icy relationship between Palin and Fox News CEO Roger Ailes have been circulating for years. He has mocked her in public, and is said to have privately labeled her "stupid." Meanwhile, her public profile has waned as the years since her bid for the vice presidency grind on. In August, New York magazine's Gabriel Sherman wrote that a new contract for Palin was a very iffy thing indeed. That report came the day after Palin publicly complained that the network had canceled some of her appearances. By the time her contract ended, it had been since mid-December that Palin had appeared on Fox News at all.</Msg><Username>bami2012</Username><Timestamp>1369184679136</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 21:04:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369185085998-77</Id><Topic><Title>5th Amendment for I.R.S. top Lawyer (Corruptocracy)</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369167831646</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 16:23:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>because soul searching is what Neocons do??? give me break, idiot!</Msg><Username>bypartisan305</Username><Timestamp>1369185085998</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 21:11:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369190877957-78</Id><Topic><Title>Tea Buggers Standing First in Line for FEMA Trailers !</Title><Username>biddermoron_ca</Username><Timestamp>1369169955886</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-21 16:59:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's obvious you have no concern nor respect for your home country language.
