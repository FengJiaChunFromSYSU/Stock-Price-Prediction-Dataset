In a new statement, the coalition of OB-GYNs warns that the Texas bills are “over-reaching” and “set a dangerous precedent” for medical care. “The Texas bills set a dangerous precedent of a legislature telling doctors how to practice medicine and how to care for individual patients,” the group’s Executive Vice President, Dr. Hal C. Lawrence III, said in the statement. “ACOG opposes legislative interference, and strongly believes that decisions about medical care must be based on scientific evidence and made by licensed medical professionals, not the state or federal government.” Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 2 — formerly known as SB 5 during Texas’ last special session — would criminalize abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and shut down the vast majority of the women’s health clinics in Texas. The proposed measures threaten to restrict access to all types of reproductive care, since many women currently receive contraceptive services and cancer screenings at the clinics that will be forced to close their doors. ACOG’s Texas District Chair, Dr. Lisa M. Hollier, called the abortion-related proposals “a compilation of over-reaching measures” intended to police the circumstances under which women can receive reproductive care. “The bills are not based on sound science, despite our efforts to provide the legislature with the best available medical knowledge,” Hollier pointed out, warning that SB 1 and HB 2 will ultimately “erode women’s health.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372858616633</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:36:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372858708195-4</Id><Topic><Title>Docs denounce TX war on women</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372858616633</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:36:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This isn’t the first time the nonpartisan OB-GYN group has taken a stand against restrictive abortion laws. Last month, ACOG issued a formal statement in opposition to the mounting pile of state-level restrictions that get in between a woman and her doctor, slamming anti-abortion laws for “imposing a political agenda on medical practice.” OB-GYNs have also repeatedly reiterated their support for expanding access to emergency contraception, and expressed bewilderment that providing young women with their full range of contraceptive options has become so politically contentious. Texas voters agree with the ACOG’s assessment about the proposed legislation. A recent poll found the 80 percent of Texans want their lawmakers to stop focusing on abortion restrictions in their special sessions. After successfully staging a “people’s filibuster” to help block the abortion restrictions last week, over 5,000 activists flooded the state capitol again on Monday to continue opposing the bills.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372858708195</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:38:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372858825857-5</Id><Topic><Title>Docs denounce TX war on women</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372858616633</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:36:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mary Morrison : "At the request of the Texas Medical Assoc., Rep. Donna Howard offered an amendment to SB 5 that would at least allow physicians and nurses in emergency to rooms administer medications to help women who were losing a pregnancy (miscarrying) to complete the miscarriage, and still the legislature overwhelmingly voted it down. So as it stood at that time, if a heartbeat had ever been detected in the fetus, and the nurses administered the needed medications, the doctors who ordered the drugs, and the nurses who gave them would be open to criminal charges, although no abortion was ever performed. Without those medications, the mother is at risk for life-threatening infection, and loss of future child bearing. Those are the kind of people who wrote SB5 and tried to vote it into law. They will not listen to physicians and nurses. (Rep. Howard is a nurse.) They will probably be successful this time. Perhaps the court will strike it down, perhaps not."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372858825857</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 09:40:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372861452077-6</Id><Title>Obama stands with the muslims</Title><Msg>They will r*pe your grandmother and your grandfather and your dogs.

The Big Question.</Title><Msg>Wingnuts blame Obama for four deaths in enemy territory, saying he ignored the warnings. ( Benghazi, enemy territory ) Bush should then be blamed for the same thing........... resulting in 3000 deaths on American soil, and 5000 troops sent to the wrong country. And if you saw the video of Bush, reading to children ......... and he didn't stop after he was told of the attack ........... and hid in his plane until it was "safe" ................ I can't understand the wingnut outrage with Obama, after they defended the much larger crime. Both ignored the warnings. Both delayed their reaction. Any arguments ? And please, no tinfoil hats.</Msg><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1372909709065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-03 23:48:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>24</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372910170927-37</Id><Title>Malia Obama.
