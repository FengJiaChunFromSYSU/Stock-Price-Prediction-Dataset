The product shutdowns, which Yahoo announced on its official company blog on Friday, are part of what the company said are regular efforts to evaluate and review its product line-up. "The most critical question we ask is whether the experience is truly a daily habit that still resonates for all of you today," wrote Jay Rossiter, Yahoo's executive vice president of Platforms. The announcement represents Yahoo's second group shutdown of products since Mayer, a former Google executive, became CEO of the struggling Web portal in July. So-called "spring cleaning" announcements, in which multiple products are shut down, have become a regular feature at Google in recent years. Mayer signaled the company would prune its line-up of mobile apps at an investor conference last month, noting that Yahoo would reduce the 60 to 75 disparate mobile apps it currently has to a more manageable 12 to 15 apps. Yahoo said its app for Blackberry smartphones would no longer be available for download, or supported by Yahoo, as of April 1. Yahoo also said that on April 1 it will stop supporting Yahoo Avatars - the cartoon-like digital characters that consumers create to depict them on Web services such as Yahoo instant messenger and Facebook. Consumers who want to continue using their avatar on Yahoo's online services must download the avatar and then re-upload the information to their personalized Yahoo profile. The other Yahoo products set to be terminated include Yahoo App Search, Yahoo Sports IQ, Yahoo Clues, the Yahoo Message Boards website and the Yahoo Updates API.

Raising funds for war in Iraq in his first 2 years in office wasn't priority despite record budget deficit of $1.4T. Democrat president, huge majority in the House and Senate, and not even a peep for raising tax rates for 2 years! We have Obamacare instead which will cost $6T in the next decade. That's equivalent to 6 Iraq wars. For what? For another piece of socialism? After accumulating extra "unpatriotic" $6T of debt we need to squeeze the rich more to cut few drops from the river flow. Subway CEO Fred DeLuca on Obamacare: "It’s going to affect the food business and it’s going to make it less competitive, compared to eating at home...". "Subway wouldn't exist' If started today due to regulations". I remember CEO of Home Depot said something similar a while ago. But who is DeLuca? Just another fat cat! Who needs them? We need everyone to be like Peggy Joseph, praising Obama for giving free stuff, or like these Obamaphone lady.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1362263203157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 17:26:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362263714070-6</Id><Title>Look out Lee Majors, we now have a new 6 trillion dollar man</Title><Msg>Read it and weep if you are not part of the 47%.... **Under Obama, the debt has already increased by more than it increased under all U.S. presidents from George Washington through Bill Clinton** The $6 Trillion Man The debt of the federal government has now increased by $6 trillion during the time that Barack Obama has been president, according to the U.S. Treasury. At the close of business on Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama was first inaugurated, the debt of the federal government was $10,626,877,048,913.08. At the close of business on Thursday, Feb. 28, the debt of the federal government hit $16,687,289,180,215.37. That means that so far during Obama’s presidency, the total debt of the federal government has increased by $6,060,412,131,302.29. According to the latest estimate from the Census Bureau, there are 115,031,000 households in the United States. Thus, the debt of the federal government has increased by approximately $52,685 per household during Obama's time in office. Under Obama, the debt has already increased by more than it increased under all U.S. presidents from George Washington through Bill Clinton.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1362263714070</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 17:35:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362265881360-7</Id><Topic><Title>We Are Not Done Sequestering</Title><Username>saywhat_1999</Username><Timestamp>1362239710969</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 10:55:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sequester is political ploy for Obama going again in campaign mode crying about evil GOP. There will be cuts in the military, that's what Obama wanted all along. Everywhere else - on paper only. But predictable with a lot of noise about some fake Julie left witout income. Like there were no 15 millions leaving workforce for welfare prior to sequester. So where is our president taking time off from his golfing schedule to make more meaningful cuts? You wish. Villifying GOP is how he views his job. Golfing makes him look like his 2nd job(governing) is done right. See, if he would actually be doing his job, people would think he is on vacation, just like W "vacationing" in Crawford, TX. 2013 spending will still exceed 2012.That's not payrol cuts, it is hiring freezze. It's a gimmick. Disgrace. So many wouldn't understand that economy can't suffer from government budget cuts. For everyone with shred of common sense, it is relief from burden. Government consumes, spends, it doesn't generate any revenue. MIlton Fridman must be mandatory reading in every high school. Well. I wish.

You (and our beloved leader to by the way)are trying to portray this category like they are stuck in those wages for life. It is almost never the case. But that's how the left creates false image of inequality. In fact, some of those low income earners in their early lives become multi-millionaires. And this early experience helps them to become business leaders, entrepreneurs, scientists, engineers or whoever they want to become. Your worthless statistics is trying to make them victims. What you are trying to do is for them to stuck behind the cashier counter till the end of life and wait for government handouts. F'get about dreams, just make sure you are not better than others. What’s more, is that some who earn $15K can have millions in the bank, others who make $500K in one year make next to $0 next year or year before. But the picture you are trying to make puts the 1st one in the category of poor and the other one as wealthy none of that is true. My today’s income is my way to become wealthy (may in fact never happen), but it is deliberately presented as permanent, lifelong status. This is why you are talking about wages adjusted for inflation, like it is your birth right.
