I am still upside down a bit, but the past two years been selling calls and managed to make about a 21% return each year. It has been a very painful few years with this stock, yet I remain optimistic there will be a decent turnaround. Nothing as dramatic like $30 per share, but I can see $18 per share in a couple of years. Uneducated guess mind you. When the interest rates rise and E gets through some of the loan runoff, I hope they get back in the loan biz....making conservative loans to QUALFIED borrowers. Brokerage biz will continue to be competitive to the point that I don't really see a ton of growth. Tech available from all the online brokers is relatively the same....E has nothing that will allow them grab a significantly bigger share of the market. Diversification in the biz will be the ticket to higher share price....not sticking with the core biz. For now, they have no choice but sticking with the core biz. Sorry for the midnight rambling.</Msg><Username>irush59</Username><Timestamp>1359178285026</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 00:31:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359178398299-2</Id><Topic><Title>This stock has hurt me</Title><Username>gentlegiantromeo</Username><Timestamp>1359125811446</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:56:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are not alone....many of us have been ganged raped by this stock.

Based on your post, I assume E is running a super bowl ad...hope it is the E baby. Have to advertise if you want to maintain or grab a bigger share of the market. Business 101. Fairly certain they will see a return in the investment.</Msg><Username>irush59</Username><Timestamp>1359178812303</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 00:40:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359201842953-4</Id><Topic><Title>Big strong volume</Title><Username>perryk01</Username><Timestamp>1359139113478</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 13:38:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, power to you. I think if you have the funds to just buy and wait it out for a few years, you will definitely see a fat return. Etfc will be worth much much more than its current PPS in the future, absolutely no doubt about that. The painful thing is how slow they are moving! Drives me crazy. I personally was hoping/kind-of-expecting the earnings would be better and the CC better. Was hoping for the new CEO Paul starting off strong in the CC with a more enthusiastic, optimistic forecast. But I don't think we heard anything new. Had huge position (for my acct) with margin, sold half, now I'm waiting to see. Things are looking not so bad after today. Hope it holds true for the coming weeks.</Msg><Username>perryk01</Username><Timestamp>1359201842953</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 07:04:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359224981249-5</Id><Topic><Title>Super Bowl Ad for Etrade</Title><Username>billwilliselkins</Username><Timestamp>1359143976935</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 14:59:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Etrade held up well in today's trading. I fully expected a 20mil share volume day with a 5-7% decline, similar to last quarter after the surprise 50mil increase in LLP's. In this market, during the past couple of weeks as long as your company was not called apple, you did pretty well. Fund flows are very strong and the vix is tame. My point is that etrade simply continues to give investors no reason to be excited about this stock. Maybe this new CEO will do something positive and give shareholders a reason to get excited. Up until now, the management and decisions have been horrible, even after the 2006/2007 blow up. It just looks like they really have no idea what "increasing shareholder value" really means although they say it often.</Msg><Username>billwilliselkins</Username><Timestamp>1359224981249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 13:29:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359228809810-6</Id><Title>I told you so, free healthcare for illegals</Title><Msg>The march to insolvency is in full force and effect.

Is this you lefties idea of social justice.... just curious. **while leaving unionized civilian defense workers’ benefits untouched** Obama To Cut Healthcare Benefits For Military The Obama administration’s proposed defense budget calls for military families and retirees to pay sharply more for their healthcare, while leaving unionized civilian defense workers’ benefits untouched. The proposal is causing a major rift within the Pentagon, according to U.S. officials. Several congressional aides suggested the move is designed to increase the enrollment in Obamacare’s state-run insurance exchanges. The disparity in treatment between civilian and uniformed personnel is causing a backlash within the military that could undermine recruitment and retention.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1359229468572</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 14:44:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359241295475-8</Id><Title>Should new Etrade CEO file lawsuit against banks and mortgage lenders?</Title><Msg>The mortgage portfolios likely had misrepresentations on documentation for the ratings supplied by the rating agencies.
