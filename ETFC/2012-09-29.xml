The RNC hired the firm to do voter registration drives for $3.1 million this year. The firm’s founder, Nathan Sproul, is a longtime Republican strategist whose reputation was tarred by widespread accusations of voter registration fraud and attempts to suppress Democratic voter turnout. George W. Bush’s campaign reportedly paid Sproul over $8 million for his work in the 2004 election. Sproul, now under new scrutiny, claims he started Strategic Allied Consulting because the RNC wanted to hide his past: Sproul said he created Strategic Allied Consulting at the RNC’s request because the party wanted to avoid being publicly linked to the past allegations. The firm was set up at a Virginia address, and Sproul does not show up on the corporate paperwork. “In order to be able to do the job that the state parties were hiring us to do, the asked us to do it with a different company’s name, so as to not be a distraction from the false information put out in the Internet,” Sproul said.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348893539666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 00:38:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348893768241-3</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on democracy</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348893539666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 00:38:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>McClatchy reporter: 'Alarming power grab' of GOP by 'misguided group of extremists' Fri Sep 28, 2012 On Thursday, I posted McClatchy Washington bureau chief James Asher’s memo to colleagues in which he says that “the process of journalism leaves a lot of nuance on the cutting room floor. And I suspect a little bit of the truth goes with it as well. … We must work to capture more nuance in our work.” ... Here’s McClatchy national correspondent James Rosen‘s response to the bureau chief. ... Even if we give Romney the benefit of a doubt that I don’t believe he’s entitled to, he’s running for the highest office and most-demanding job on the planet. If he says stupid and thoughtless things about the Chinese or the Russians or the Iranians, will they shrug their shoulders and say, “Gosh, we know Mitt didn’t mean it?” Romney’s dad was governor of my state when I was a boy, and I loved him. He could mix it up with anyone, from royalty to janitors, he was a real person, and he stood for important things. Mitt has been running for president for six years, and I still don’t know who he is or what he stands for. I would suggest that is why he’s losing ground in polls, not because the anti-Republican crowd is misunderstanding his statements. I agree with you that a lot of nuance gets lost on the cutting board, and that that is unfortunate. But I think a bigger reason our readers are losing faith in us is that we are less willing to call things by their true names, cut through cant and tell readers what is really going on. One of the important stories of our time that we are missing is how a misguided group of extremists, many of them closet racists like the author of the South Carolina voter ID law I’ve been covering, is trying to take over one of our two major political parties. Romney’s mean-spirited video rant is a cowardly accommodation to that alarming power grab.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348893768241</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 00:42:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348894686291-4</Id><Topic><Title>President Romney WINS in Landslide!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1348835996084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 08:39:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pacifica, Where does it say it is up to the Prez to create jobs???

As economist Justin Wolfers noted, this means that President Obama is now net positivefor job creation over his term in office, even taking into account the massive losses in January 2009: The BLS benchmark revisions means that there has been a net jobs gain since Jan ’09. Romney can no longer talk about job losses under Obama. — Justin Wolfers , September 27, 2012 BLS Benchmark revisions mean that over the year to March 2012, the economy was adding 194k jobs per month, not 162k as previously thought. — Justin Wolfers , September 27, 2012 The Economist’s Greg Ip noted that the revisions mean that Obama’s net job creation number is now 125,000: Incorporating today’s BLS revision, net payroll growth over Obama’s term would move from -261K to +125K. — Greg Ip , September 27, 2012 The new numbers — which are based off of unemployment insurance reports that employers submit to the federal government — show that 453,000 more private sector jobs were created than shown by previous estimates, meaning Obama’s net private sector job creation total is now 868,000. Government jobs, meanwhile, shrank by an additional 67,000. It’s also worth noting that Obama has already produced more new private sector jobs than his predecessor, George W. Bush. Bush ended both his first and second terms in the hole in terms of private sector job creation. Only significant increases in government employment allowed him to eek out a small overall net gain by the end of his two terms in office. BOTTOM LINE: Ahead of next week’s critical first presidential debate, today’s news deprives Mitt Romney of one of his most frequently used talking points: that Obama has created no new jobs. While that talking point was always highly misleading at best, it is now a lie by any measure.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348934735174</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 12:05:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348935295433-8</Id><Topic><Title>Once again , the morally bankrupt GOP abandons "principles" and promises</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348770939799</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 14:35:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another Republican jumps back on Akin bandwagon By MANU RAJU | 9/28/12 1:14 PM EDT Last month, former Missouri Sen. Kit Bond called on Todd Akin to end his bid to unseat Sen. Claire McCaskill -- and declared the Senate race "lost" if the conservative congressman refused to quit in the wake of his "legitimate rape" remarks. How times have changed. Bond -- joining Sen. Roy Blunt and the National Republican Senatorial Committee, among others -- is now changing his tune and supporting Akin, who refused to drop out before a deadline that passed earlier this week. "Todd's comments were unacceptable but he's apologized, I believe his regret is sincere, and it is time to focus on the national stakes in this election," Bond said in a Friday statement. "Todd can win and I'll be doing what I can to help ensure the Democrats that gave us big government and job-killing policies like 'Obamacare' don't continue controlling the U.S. Senate." But at the Republican National Convention last month, Bond was blunt about Akin's chances. “Unfortunately with him on the ticket, not only is the Senate race lost, but I think the state ticket is in danger,” Bond told POLITICO at the time.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348935295433</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 12:14:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348935897710-9</Id><Title>The Dipshidiot straddle</Title><Msg>Mitt Romney: Mitt: Military action on Iran may not be needed By: Darren Samuelsohn September 28, 2012 05:04 PM EDT ABOARD THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN PLANE — ­ Mitt Romney said that military action to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon may not be necessary, though he still pledged to take a tough line against the nation if elected president. “I do not believe that in the final analysis we will have to use military action. I certainly hope we don’t have to,” Romney told reporters on Friday. “I can’t take that option off the table — it must be something which is known by the Iranians as a possible tool to be employed to prevent them from becoming nuclear. But I certainly hope that we can prevent any military action from having to be taken.” The GOP nominee’s statements came after Romney and President Barack Obama both spoke Friday by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a day after Netanyahu warned of Iran’s nuclear ambitions during a speech this week to the United Nations General Assembly. “We spoke about his assessment of where the red line ought to be drawn and my own views with regards to Iran,” Romney said, noting the two also covered other Middle East developments in Syria and Egypt. Asked if there was any daylight between himself and Netanyahu on thresholds for military intervention in Iran, Romney replied, “We did not go into enough, into the kind of detail that would define precisely where that red line would be.” Romney has taken a tough posture towards Iran, calling it the top U.S. national security priority. He has also supported the right of Israel to unilaterally defend itself by intervening militarily to disarm a nuclear Iran. “If Israel has to take action on its own, in order to stop Iran from developing that capability the governor would respect that decision,” top Romney adviser Dan Senor said during a July trip by the GOP nominee to Israel. On Friday, Romney said as president he would undertake “extensive covert activity” if he were president and leaving open the door to U.S. military action if that country continues pushing development of nuclear weapons. Speaking to reporters while en route to Boston, the Republican presidential nominee outlined his Iran agenda when asked how his policy differs from that of the Obama administration. “There would be extensive covert activity, but I’m not aware of the president’s and our administration’s covert actions to an extent to be able to define differences between the two of us in that regard,” Romney said. “And of course I would be exploring military options in the event they were necessary, and again, what options the president has considered is something only he could describe.” Romney and Republicans have been hitting Obama hard for straining the U.S. relationship with Israel. But the GOP nominee’s remarks on Iran are similar to President Barack Obama’s, with both of them pledging to stop that country from obtaining a nuclear capability. On the plane today, Romney said the president’s stance on Iran has “moved over time” to get closer to where the GOP nominee stands on the foreign policy issue. Obama’s “words more recently are more consistent with the words I’ve been speaking for some time, and we’ll see what actions he pursues,” Romney said, explaining that he would have taken action to indict Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad under the Geneva Convention “for incitation of genocide.” “I think that’s still an option open to us,” Romney said. “That would be a course I would take. I would also look to take action against their diplomats and treat them like the pariah I think they are, the same way wetreated South African diplomats under Apartheid.” Romney also softened his tone against the Obama administration for its handling of the aftermath of the attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya on Sept. 11, saying it was “premature to describe precisely what the administration did correctly or incorrectly” while an investigation is ongoing.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1348935897710</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 12:24:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348936321730-10</Id><Title>DUMBO!

The candidate certified that after February 1999 he was not involved with Bain Capital operations "in any way." But he signed documents for the firm's big deals. By David Corn | Fri Jul. 13, 2012 3:30 PM PDT The ongoing hullabaloo over the timing of Mitt Romney's exit from Bain has become a bit absurd. The Romney camp and Bain insist that Romney fully retired in February 1999 from the private equity firm he founded and owned—even though in the past he and Bain have described his departure as a part-time leave—and evidence has emerged (including Securities and Exchange documents I first reported [1]) showing that Romney was involved to some extent in Bain as late as 2002, while he continued to maintain his ownership of the firm and its various entities. Romney has been working hard to avoid being held responsible for any post-February 1999 Bain deals that might have resulted in bankruptcies or outsourcing. But there is another reason for the Romney crew to worry about this controversy: Romney may have made a false statement on a federal financial disclosure form, and doing so is a felony punishable [2] by up to one year of imprisonment and a $50,000 fine. Like all presidential candidates, Romney has to submit a financial disclosure statement to the Office of Government Ethics. He filed his most recent one last month, and the disclosure [9] contains a very clearly stated footnote: Mr. Romney retired from Bain Capital on February 11, 1999 to head the Salt Lake [Olympics] Organizing Committee. Since February 11, 1999, Mr. Romney has not had any active role with any Bain Capital entity and has not been involved in the operations of any Bain Capital entity in any way. There's no ambiguity there: not involved in Bain operations in any way. But that's not true. As I reported [1], in November 1999, Romney signed a SEC filing that noted he was the "sole shareholder, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President" of several Bain entities that had acquired 22 percent of medical-waste firm Stericycle. The form also stated that Romney shared "voting and dispositive power with respect to" 2,116,588 shares of common stock in Stericycle "in his capacity as sole shareholder" of the Bain entities that were part of this $75 million investment. To repeat: Romney signed a Bain document pursuant to a $75 million deal. That would appear to qualify as involvement in Bain activity. And according to a Bain spokeswoman, Romney signed such documents more than once. She told me [1] that after February 1999 Romney was a "signatory on certain documents" until his separation agreement with Bain was finalized in 2002. A Romney campaign official, asked if Romney's disclosure statement was inaccurate, told Mother Jones, "signing technical documents as required by law doesn't constitute an active role or involvement in the operations." But on his federal disclosure statement, Romney declared no participation in "any way"—which presumably would cover signing documents that enabled deals to go forward. Additionally, a Bain press release [10] issued on July 19, 1999, described Romney as "currently on a part-time leave of absence"—not retired—and it quoted Romney speaking for Bain Capital regarding the departure of two of its managing directors. Numerous other SEC filings submitted by Bain in the years following February 1999 list Romney as a Bain executive and a member of its "management committee." (Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo found [11] two SEC filings from 2000 and 2001 listing Romney's "principle occupation" as managing director of Bain.) And the Boston Globe made a splash this week when it reported [12] that it had unearthed "nine SEC filings submitted by four different business entities after February 1999 that describe Romney as Bain Capital's boss; some show him with managerial control over five Bain Capital entities that were formed in January 2002." The Huffington Post, meanwhile, reported [13] on testimony Mitt Romney gave in 2002 in which he acknowledged that after he headed to Salt Lake City he still participated in board meetings for firms in which Bain had invested. (In an interview on Friday, Romney said that in this time frame one of these firms, Staples, no longer was connected to Bain.) Some fact-checkers and journalists have challenged the assertion that Romney continued to play a role in Bain after February 1999. Dan Primack, a senior editor at Fortune, obtained [14] Bain documents from 2000 that don't include Romney on the list of Bain's managers or "key investment professionals" or as part of the day-to-day operations or investment committee. But the question here is not whether Romney was actively managing funds on a daily basis, but whether he did anything at all that was Bain-related. Glenn Kessler, who writes the Washington Post's "Fact Checker" column, dismisses [15] the SEC filings bearing Romney's name, insisting, "much of the language saying Romney was 'sole stockholder, chairman of the board, chief executive officer, and president' was boilerplate that did not reveal whether he was actually managing Bain at the time." Again, there is a difference between managing and participating in the firm's operations. Kessler notes that Romney signed that public disclosure form, under the penalty of perjury. Still, he doesn't seem to believe this is a problem for Romney. He does concede, "The SEC documents, especially the ones Romney signed, do raise some questions. One can certainly argue that because Romney did not fully extricate himself from Bain till after his Olympic sojourn ended, he should bear some responsibility for what happened in that period." Kessler, though, slams the Obama campaign—three Pinocchios!—for saying that Romney and Bain may have violated the law by filing documents with the SEC that falsely represented Romney's status at Bain. But even Kessler's reading of the available evidence could land Romney in hot water regarding his financial disclosure form. While he contends the available evidence does not support the claim Romney actively managed Bain after February 1999, he does find that the signed SEC documents indicate that Romney, at the least, did not "fully extricate himself from Bain" until 2002. That would suggest that Romney's declaration on his disclosure form—no involvement "in any way"—is inaccurate. The Romney camp maintains that a few signatures here or there are no big deal. But Romney declared in a document submitted to the US government that he had nothing to do with Bain operations after February 1999. In light of that, those signatures are not nothing.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1348937257659</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 12:47:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348937829472-14</Id><Title>Dipshidiot is a LIAR</Title><Msg>A Case of Romnesia Mitt Romney's long history of misremembering his past. By David Corn Mitt Romney has a history problem. It's not only that past events and stances—say, his implementation of an Obamacare-like reform in Massachusetts, or his 1994 call for "full equality" for gay and lesbians—undermine his current efforts by calling into question his political integrity. Romney often distorts—or is detached from—significant realities of his personal past. Voters and the media world received a glimpse of this last month when the Washington Post disclosed [1] that Romney, while attending an elite prep school, once led a posse of schoolmates to assault a fellow student who was thought to be gay. Though the newspaper cited five sources, including several participants in the brutal episode, Romney, through a spokeswoman, claimed he had "no memory" of the matter. After the story appeared, Romney, still insisting not to recall the event, apologized for pranks that "might have gone too far." Yet his lack of recollection was tough to believe, especially given the searing memories the attack had left within others. More important, Romney's blank-out was in keeping with a pattern of selective and manipulative presentations of his past. He's not merely a flip-flopper; he's a self-revisionist. I. The Father Romney has a wonderfully colorful and much-storied family past. His great-great grandfather Miles Archibald Romney, an English carpenter, was one of the first Brits to convert to Mormonism. Following the call, Miles immigrated to Illinois. Three generations later—after plenty of family drama intertwined with the rise of the Mormon Church—the Romney family would yield George, Mitt's father. He would become an innovative auto executive, a well-regarded governor of Michigan (who in 1964 walked out of the Republican National Convention to protest nominee Barry Goldwater's opposition to civil rights legislation), and a presidential candidate. On the campaign trail, Romney, attempting to establish some 99-percent cred, has emphasized his gritty and hardscrabble family roots, citing his father. In a campaign appearance in February, Romney repeated a familiar refrain [2]: My father never graduated from college. He apprenticed as a lath and plaster carpenter. And he [was] pretty good at it. He actually could take a handful of nails, stick them in his mouth and then, you know, spit them out, pointy end forward. On his honeymoon, he put aluminum paint in the trunk of the car and sold it along the way to pay for the gas in the hotels. Mitt's father, in this account, was one helluva tough guy with quite a pair of bootstraps, a working-class hero. But that's not quite what happened. George attended George Washington University in Washington, DC, and while he was a student, according to Michael Kranish and Scott Helman's fine biography, The Real Romney, George Romney became a typist and then a policy aide for Sen. David Walsh (D-Mass.). He then used his Capitol Hill connections to obtain a job as a salesman for the Aluminum Company of America. He only dropped out of school to chase after Lenore, his sweetheart (and future wife), who had headed to Hollywood to become an actress. George Romney may have been a good nail-spitter. But he was also a fellow who benefited from inside influence. He parlayed that Senate job into the salesman position, and a few years later, after he had persuaded Lenore to marry him in 1931, George returned to Washington—to become a lobbyist for the Aluminum Company of America. He would later leave that perch and go to work for the Automobile Manufacturers Association. A carpenter who sold paint, or a well-connected lobbyist? George's lathing and plastering had little to do with his future success. He had been a Washington insider. But that crucial part of the Romney family biography is excised from Romney's public memories. (Romney has distorted the past [3] regarding his father in another way, claiming in a 1978 interview, "My father and I marched with Martin Luther King Jr. through the streets of Detroit." When later news accounts questioned whether this had occurred, Romney said he had meant it as "figure of speech.") II. The War Mitt Romney, who was born in 1947, was eligible for the Vietnam War draft. But he did not serve in the military. In 2007, he told the Boston Globe that he "longed in many respects to actually be in Vietnam and be representing our country there, and in some ways it was frustrating not to feel like I was there as part of the troops that were fighting in Vietnam." Romney could have acted on that supposed longing by merely signing up—or by not taking steps to avoid the draft. But he chose to duck the war. Romney's blank-out was in keeping with a pattern of selective and manipulative presentations of his past. In 1994, when Romney was running for the Senate against Ted Kennedy, he told the Boston Herald that he did not "take any actions to remove myself from the pool of young men who were eligible for the draft." But that's exactly what he had done. As the Associated Press recently reported [4], Romney, while at Stanford in 1965, sought a deferment as a college student. Then for two-and-half years, as he served as a Mormon missionary in France, he maintained a deferment "as a minister of religion or divinity student." After that deferment expired, Romney again received another academic studies deferment. That final deferment ran out in 1970, and Romney became eligible for the draft as US troops in Vietnam were decreasing. But his draft number was high, and he was never called. So his story—he yearned to be fighting for the United States in Vietnam and did nothing to keep himself out of the reach of Uncle Sam—is false. And he has not acknowledged in public a particularly interesting wrinkle. At Stanford, Romney led a protest against demonstrators who mounted an anti-war sit-in at the university. He held a sign that proclaimed, "SPEAK OUT, DON'T SIT IN." Yet five years later, in 1970, after George Romney had turned against the war, Romney told the [4]Boston Globe [4], "If it wasn't a political blunder to move into Vietnam, I don't know what is." Romney wished he could have gone to war, but he didn't enlist. He took no steps to prevent himself being drafted, but he did. He supported the war, then he didn't. As a politically-minded son of privilege and politics, Vietnam was a confusing matter for Romney, and he has not addressed that publicly. III. The Businessman Why should Mitt Romney be president? He says it is because of his experience as a free-enterprise-loving businessman who has had whopping success in the private sector. On the stump, Romney praises risk-taking entrepreneurial behavior. "What makes America's economy go is individuals with dreams who take risks, borrow money from their family, max out their credit cards, maybe get an outside investor," he declared this month. He claims that [5] President Obama doesn't understand this basic dynamic of the US economy, and Romney suggests that he himself possesses a fundamental appreciation, due to his own biography. At a Republican debate last fall, when Herman Cain challenged Romney's business record, Romney countered that he had been the CEO of a "start-up." [6] Announcing his presidential bid in June 2011, Romney more fully described his role [7] as a private-sector free spirit: Twenty seven years ago, I left a steady job to join with some friends to start a business. Like many of you, it had been a dream of mine to try and build a business from the ground up. We started in a small office a couple of hours from here and over the years, we were able to grow from ten employees to hundreds. He was, by his own account, the embodiment of the American spirit: a risk-taking, rugged, go-for-it entrepreneur, willing to sacrifice his "steady job" for a shot at his dream. Romney didn't leap at the chance to follow his supposed dream of building "a business from the ground up." His first instinct was to play it safe. Not really. After graduating from Harvard University's business and law schools—not one, but two citadels of the elite!—Romney rose through the ranks of Bain &amp; Company, a consulting firm. He so impressed Bill Bain, the head of the firm, that Bain asked Romney to oversee the creation of a private equity off-shoot, Bain Capital, which would look to buy up troubled companies, put them in order, and resell them for a profit. And Romney said no. As recounted in The Real Romney (an essential read for anyone looking to understand the GOP candidate), Romney "saw the opportunity, of course, but he also saw risks." With five kids at home, he already had a comfortable set-up: great job at Bain &amp; Company, money in the bank. He'd have to kick in some of the start-up funds, and he didn't want to put his present salary and financial resources on the line. That is, he didn't leap at the chance to follow his supposed dream of building "a business from the ground up." His first instinct was to play it safe and not be a daring entrepreneur. Bill Bain made it safe for Romney. He told the young biz-wiz that if Bain Capital flopped, Romney could have his old job back—and all the salary increases he might have missed. But this wasn't enough insurance for Romney, who worried his reputation might be tainted should he fail to deliver at the new enterprise. Bain promised that if Romney had to come back to Bain &amp; Company, he'd tell people that was because the consulting firm needed Romney desperately. "So," Bain later said to Kranish and Helman, "there was no professional or financial risk" for Romney. Romney was given a golden elevator. And he made the most of it. But his path to becoming a quarter-billionaire is hardly a classic tale of risk-defying entrepreneurship. Romney's serial denials of past positions have partly shaped his public political persona. He was for gun control measures, now he's not. He favored climate change action, now he doesn't. He was a fan of individual health care mandates, now he decries Obamacare. His craven flexibility was perhaps best epitomized when he tried to explain to Kranish and Helman why during the 1994 Senate campaign he had written a letter to the Log Cabin Republicans, a pro-gay rights group, asserting a desire "to establish full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens." He told the reporters, "well, okay, let's look at that in the context of who it's being written to." Romney, in this moment of candor, was inadvertently admitting he was an unapologetic panderer. That was an exception. Romney tends to reject charges of flip-flopping, as he did in his unsuccessful interview last November with Fox News' Bret Baier. And this is to be expected. To be a credible candidate, Romney cannot acknowledge his long list of 180s. (Nor can he dwell on his years as governor of Massachusetts, where his signature accomplishment was health care reform that was the basis for Obama's initiative.) But his refutation of the past extends beyond the politician's traditional refusal to acknowledge previous positions that have since become inconvenient. He has adopted an overly flexible attitude toward his personal history, showing that he is an unreliable source of information about himself. If he cannot tell his own tale accurately, can he be trusted to tell the nation's?</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1348937829472</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 12:57:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348938244349-15</Id><Topic><Title>Ann Romney has Doubts About Mitt's Brain</Title><Username>mittins_da_wimpins</Username><Timestamp>1348888093066</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 23:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mitt won the nomination from the worst field of candidates and fools and adulterers in history.

By Josh Harkinson Unlike Mitt Romney, most Americans who will pay their taxes today can't afford fancy accountants. But Romney has reluctantly made public his tax returns, and thus shared valuable strategies to ensure that he pays a far lower rate than, say, Warren Buffett's secretary. Citizens for Tax Justice [1] recently waded through Romney's 2010 return—in which his $22 million in income was miraculously taxed at just 13.9 percent [2]—to come up with a handy primer for how you, too, can beat the IRS at its own game. To paraphrase: 1. Don't work for a living The tax rate on money earned actually working ("salaries and wages") can be more than double the rate on money earned sitting around watching your investments go up in value ("capital gains"), thanks to the work of other people. Almost all of Romney's income is taxed as capital gains. 2. If you work, disguise your compensation as capital gains About half of the $15 million in capital gains and dividend income Romney reported in 2010 was actually compensation for his work at Bain Capital. But using a tax loophole favored by private-equity guys, he was able to get paid by taking equity stakes in deals that he put together ("carried interest," in tax parlance) instead of in the proletarian form of a fully taxable salary. Bonus: This allowed Bain to avoid paying Medicare payroll taxes. 3. Give to charity—but not with cash, checks, or money orders In 2010, Romney was able to write off $1.5 million worth of Domino's Pizza stock he donated to a charity. It is likely that he originally received the stock as compensation from Bain, in which case the price he paid for it would have been close to zero. In this scenario, by donating the stock instead of selling it and donating the cash, Romney would have saved about $220,000 in taxes. 4. Give to charity—but not now Romney's return reports income from the W. Mitt Romney 1996 Charitable Remainder UniTrust. Not only is the trust tax exempt, but when Romney set it up 16 years ago, he got a tax deduction for making a charitable donation. Though the money in the trust is eventually supposed to go to charity, Romney can receive income from the trust for a number of years—quite possibly for the rest of his life. 5. Give to charity—your own In 2010 Romney made a tax-deductible, $1.5 million donation to the Tyler Charitable Foundation, which he controls. Commanding your own foundation allows you to curry favor with political and business allies by donating money to their pet organizations and causes. For instance, in 2010 the Tyler Charitable Foundation donated [3] $100,000 to to the George W. Bush Library. 6. Do not invest in America Certain foreign investment vehicles allow you to avoid certain taxes. For example, Romney's Individual Retirement Account could bypass the Unrelated Business Income Tax by investing through a foreign corporation. Though it's hard to know whether Romney availed himself of those kinds of savings, he has invested substantially in foreign entities, including ones based in offshore tax havens such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, and Luxembourg. 7. Invest in sexy financial instruments Romney earned $415,000 from an investment that gets special tax treatment: Through an accounting loophole, 60 percent of the profits from the investment are treated as long-term capital gains, a designation that has tax benefits, no matter how long the investment is held. 8. Borrow money to invest While you can't deduct interest from car loans or credit cards, you can write off interest on the money you borrow to make certain types of investments—for instance, if you borrow from a broker to buy stock (a "margin loan"). Portfolio management fees are also write-offs. A fellow like Romney, who makes his millions mainly from investments, could probably deduct a fair sum. 9. Push the limits of the law When you engage in a type of transaction that the IRS views as potentially abusive, you must disclose it in a separate form. In 2010, Romney filed six such forms. 10. Be part of the 1 percent When it comes to taxes, it costs money to save money. You'll need to hire lawyers to help you set up tax-exempt charities and trusts or exploit offshore tax havens—and a professional money manager if you plan to invest in sexy financial instruments. It probably won't be cost effective if you aren't already rich, but any hard-working son of a governor can land a job at a private-equity firm and start getting paid in carried interest. Bonus: You might make enough money to one day run for president.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1348939970346</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 13:32:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348943263601-18</Id><Topic><Title>What will you do when they come for you</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1348863635560</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 16:20:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Idiot at large..</Msg><Username>du_fonz</Username><Timestamp>1348943263601</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 14:27:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348948256290-19</Id><Topic><Title>DUMBO!

At that rally, Mitt Romney admitted he tripped his daughter-in-law, who had just given birth, in order to win a family race. CRAIG ROMNEY: ...And it was down to my wife and my dad over here. ROMNEY: I tripped her. CRAIG ROMNEY: And it was kind of in the home stretch in the run there. And she had a slight lead on him. And he said that in that moment, he decided he was going to win that race or he was going to die trying. And you see this fight to the finish, and he went for this -- he gave it everything he had. He gave it a good kick and he beat her in the end. And he did almost die trying, by the way. He passed out in a lawn chair and we didn't see him the rest of the day. He barely made lot of life. But it's that type of hard work, it's that type of determination, I think, that we need in the White House. The Atlantic Wire, January 31, 2012 That's nice, an old man trips his own daughter-in-law to win a foot race ... hmmm ... well, at least he didn't impersonate a cop this time like he did when he was in college. Was Mitt 'kidding' when he volunteered on stage that he tripped his daughter-in-law in a foot race to win? hmm ... I seem to recall the family laughed when the story first broke of Mitt driving 12 hours with a dog on the roof of his car ... then they stopped laughing. But, in their defense, Ann Romney has told us that the dog loved being placed on the roof for 12 hours. In June 2012, the rightwing blog Daily Caller wrote that Mitt Romney would often impersonate police and pull drivers over. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney was once quite the prankster. Apparently he was also somewhat of a felon. Reporter Joe Conason writes in an article published by The National Memo that Romney routinely impersonated police officers by sporting a cop uniform that he owned. Romney would show off his uniform, apparently a gift from his father, to friends. One of Romney’s college friends, Robin Madden, claims the former Massachusetts governor “told us that he was using it to pull over drivers on the road.” “He also had a red flashing light that he would attach to the top of his white Rambler,” Madden said. “We thought it was all pretty weird,” recalled Madden’s wife, who also attended Stanford University with Romney. “We all thought, ‘Wow, that’s pretty creepy.” Daily Caller June 2012</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1348952579936</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 17:02:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348952845799-23</Id><Topic><Title>George W.

Major Garrett was on NPR's Diane Rehm show today. The host was not Diane Rehm but was Tom Gjelten. A caller called in and asked the panel why we should believe Romney is telling the truth about anything he says about his Tax Returns when he was caught lying on and about his 1999-2001 Tax Returns. After the caller outlined that in June 2002 Romney got caught lying on and about his Federal and State 1999-2001 and explained that for months Romney and his campaigned had been telling the people of Massachusetts to "trust me" regarding Romney's Tax Returns only to find out in June 2002 that Romney had not only lied to the people of Massachusetts for months on end, but actually had lied on his 1999-2001 Federal and State Tax Returns so he had to Amend them retroactively. The host, Tom Gjelten, was in disbelief and said, "lying on tax returns is a serious issue." Yes, Gjelten is correct, lying on Tax Returns is a serious issue which explains why Mitt Romney Amended his 1999-2001 Federal and State Tax Returns retroactively - before he got in trouble for lying on them. Major Garrett said he had never heard that story and then he went on to talk about Harry Reid. I like Major Garrett, I think, now that he is off Fox, he is fair minded and has a lot of journalistic integrity. Therefore, I think it is time to educate Major Garrett with the fact that yes, in 2002 Mitt Romney was factually caught lying on and about 3 years worth of Federal and State Tax Returns. Facts 1) In order to be qualified to run for Governor of Massachusetts you have to prove your Primary Residency was Massachusetts for 7 consecutive years. 2) For months and month, between April 2002 - June 2002, Romney and his campaign said, "trust me when I tell you that my 1999-2001 Tax Returns listed Massachusetts as my Residency." 3) That chant Romney and his campaign spouted about in 2), above, to the People of Massachusetts turned out to be a blatant bold-faced lie when the facts came out on June 7, 2002. 4) In April 2002, Mitt Romney secretly Amended 1999-2001 Tax Returns to finally include Massachusetts as his residency. 5) On June 7, 2002, Mitt Romney had to publicly admit that he had been lying to the MA people and that he had not listed Massachusetts as any form of Residency on his 1999-2001 Tax Returns. 6) On June 7, 2002, Romney had to tell the MA People that on April 2002 he Amended his 1999-2002 Tax Returns to finally include Massachusetts as a residence retroactively. 7) Between April 2002 and June 2002 he, Mitt Romney, knowingly, willingly and with forethought intentionally lied to the People of Massachusetts when he falsely claimed he had listed Massachusetts as his residency on his 1999-2001 Tax Returns. 8) Mitt Romney finally had to admit he only Amended his 1999-2001 Returns in April 2002 after he decided to run for Governor of Massachusetts -- 'for Pete's sake.' 9) Mitt Romney testified, under oath, that he habitually and routinely perjures himself to the Federal and State Governments about the accuracy and completeness of his personal Tax Returns as he, a licensed lawyer, testified that he willfully ignored the fact that he was legally compelled to examine Form 1040 and all attached Schedules under the pains of Penalty of Perjury as he testified he had not even bothered to even so much as read if the State of his Permanent Residence, domicile, was even filled out. Evidence That Backs Up Facts: Below is a partial transcript of Mitt Romney, under oath, with the Massachusetts Board of Election plus a series of 2002 articles that support the items I listed as "Fact" above. June 19, 2002, from 2002 New York Times: Until early June, Mr. Romney had said that he had paid his taxes as a Massachusetts resident while in Utah. He later acknowledged [June 7, 2002] that in 1999 and 2000 he paid state taxes as a Utah resident and listed himself as either a part-time resident or a non-resident of Massachusetts. He said that in April, after deciding to run for governor, he had amended his 1999 and 2000 tax returns to say that he was a Massachusetts resident. ~June 19, 2002 GOP Candidate Seeks to Clarify Massachusetts Residency Issue New York Times (page 2) June 7, 2002 Boston Globe: Boston Globe reported Mitt had been lying to the MA People and Mitt finally admitted he listed Utah as his primary residence so he Amended his 1999-2002 Federal &amp; State Tax Returns retroactively in April 2002 when he decided to run for Governor of MA. ROMNEY: “I am Amending them because it is the right thing to do. I was not thinking of running for office. I was trying to fill our -- my tax forms as accurately as possible.” ~ Romney quote in Romney says he didn’t file as Mass. resident in ’99-’00 Boston Globe 6/7/2002 There it is again, I didn't know I would run for office for Pete's sake. June 13, 2002: Boston Globe [...] Romney had told a "baldfaced lie" when he originally told reporters he filed income tax returns as a resident of Massachusetts when living in Utah. Romney later acknowledged he had not filed as a resident, but Amended those Returns to claim resident status after he decided to run for governor. Also yesterday, Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom, after denying it earlier in the week, confirmed that a lawyer for the Romney campaign had contacted Harvard Law School constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe. ~Boston Globe "Romney Offers Documents On Utah Tax Break Payment Record Called A Mistake" June 18, 2002: Romney, under Oath, told the Massachusetts State Ballot Commission that he signed the IRS Form 1040 but, gee whiz, he had no idea his signature meant he was signing under Penalty of Perjury that he had examined his 1040 and schedules in their entirety. 2002 New York Times reported: Mitt Romney said in a hearing before the Massachusetts Ballot Law Commission. ROMNEY: ''I do not read those [IRS 1040] or review those before I sign them nor the attached Schedules,'' ~June 19, 2002 GOP Candidate Seeks to Clarify Massachusetts Residency Issue New York Times (page 2) See the picture below? That's a picture of the Signature Line on IRS Form 1040. See the part above where you sign your name that says: "Under penalty of perjury, I declare that I have examined this return and accompanying schedules and statements and to the best of my knowledge they are true, correct and complete. ~IRS Form 1040 " Romney does not claim he 'didn't see' the sentence saying he was signing under Penalty of Perjury, Romney was saying he didn't give a damn that he was signing under Penalty of Perjury because, as you will see in the below Transcript when Mitt was under Oath, Mitt does not examine any document he signs under Penalty of Perjury, thus, Romney admitted he habitually, routinely, willingly perjures himself. June 18, 2002: Here is the MS Ballot Commission exchange after Romney said he didn't bother to examine his Tax Returns. LAWYER: "...if I were to hand you an affidavit, Mr. Romney, and at the end of it, typed in your signature, and above your signature, I put "signed under the pains and penalties of perjury," and I said, "Mr. Romney, sign this document," you'd read it first; wouldn't you?" ROMNEY: "If you were to put it in front of me, yes." LAWYER: "So, you'd sign documents under the pains and penalties of perjury without necessarily reading them; is that your testimony?" ROMNEY: "I have not read the entire Massachusetts tax form, nor the Federal tax form, nor the Utah tax form, and all of them have me sign under pains and penalty to the best of my knowledge and belief, and I do not read the entire form." [-June 18, 2002 testimony before MA State Ballot Commission] I find it very troubling that Mitt Romney admits he signs his signature to documents, under the pains of Penalty of Perjury, without examining the document to determine if the document is accurate --- something very troubling about that. June 8, 2002: Boston Globe reports Mitt profited by listing Utah, not Massachusetts, as his Primary Residence. By declaring himself a Utah resident rather than a Massachusetts resident in 1999 and 2000, gubernatorial candidate Mitt Romney might have saved on his taxes if he had substantial short-term capital gains, analysts said yesterday; otherwise, Utah residency would have provided him no obvious tax benefits. Utah doesn't differentiate between capital gains and regular income, which means Romney would have paid the top 7 percent tax rate on all of the earnings as a resident there. Massachusetts, on the other hand, taxes gains from investments held less than a year at 12 percent and hits longer-term capital gains at a sliding scale that falls to zero for investments held six years or more. ~ Boston Globe, June 8, 2002 "Tax Benefit Unclear and Candidate Mum" (Boston Globe requires subscription for complete article, sorry) The same article reports When it came to light that [Romney] had gained a $54,000 tax break by claiming his Utah home as his primary residence, [Romney] said that that filing was the result of a clerical error. When reporters questioned whether he'd also profited on his income taxes by declaring Utah residency, Romney first said that he would respond to questions posed in writing. When those questions were submitted. ~ Boston Globe, 6/8/02, "Tax Benefit Unclear and Candidate Mum" June 8, 2002 same Boston Globe article But after a reporter submitted written questions to a campaign aide, Romney's spokesman, Eric Fehrnstrom, said that Romney would not be responding because "he values his privacy and his wife's privacy." A few minutes later, pressed on whether he benefited financially in Utah by filing as a resident there and a nonresident in Massachusetts, he said: "That's as far as I'm telling you, that's it. That's the answer I'm going to give you, and that's all I got." That sounds like what Romney camp says now, "we won't release any more taxes period, you people got all you're going to get -- oh and did mention, my secret Tax Returns show I never paid less than 13% tax rate -- trust me" June 8, 2002 New York Times reports Romney intentionally lied to the People of Massachusetts about his Tax Returns. Mr. Romney insisted until Thursday that he had paid his taxes as a Massachusetts resident during his three years in Utah. Then he acknowledged that in 1999 and 2000 he paid his state taxes as a Utah resident and listed himself as nonresident of Massachusetts. ~ New York Times "Republican's Candidacy Is Challenged By Democrats" June 19, 2002: Boston Globe reports Romney acknowledged under oath yesterday that he filed income taxes as a part-time resident of Massachusetts in 1999 and a nonresident in 2000. In April, after he announced he would run for governor, he amended the returns to claim Massachusetts residency, he confirmed under oath. When the Globe first raised the issue, Romney initially said he had filed as a resident of both states. He later revised that position [retroactively] Also yesterday introduced an affidavit from a Utah reporter who wrote in 2000 that Romney had told her he had declared his Utah house "his primary residence for tax purposes." Deseret News reporter Lisa Riley Roche provided an affidavit stating that the article was, to her knowledge, a "fair and accurate representation" of what Romney told her in an interview. Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom said Romney had been talking about his status as a Utah resident for income tax purposes, not property taxes. ~ The Boston Globe June 19, 2002 "Romney Taxes Show No 'Domicile'" (Globe requires paid subscription for complete article, sorry) Since Mitt Romney signed his 1999-2001 Tax Returns under Penalty of Perjury indicating Utah was his residency, then he lied on his Tax Returns and had to Amend them 3 years later so he would not be accused of defrauding the Federal Government and the State of Utah. Additionally, he would have had to Amend them 3 years later so he would not be accused of being a tax evader by the State of Massachusetts. Because, like NPR host Tom Gjelten said, "lying on tax returns is a serious issue." I believe I have provided enough evidence, that is documented in history, to conclude: Mitt Romney, knowingly, willingly and with forethought intentionally lied to the People of Massachusetts when he falsely claimed he had listed Massachusetts as his residency on his 1999-2001 Tax Returns. Clearly Mitt Romney is willing to lie to the People about what is in his Tax Returns. What I find disturbing, is Mitt Romney lied to the People of Massachusetts about the "Residency" listed on his Tax Returns. What else, what other big ticket items on Mitt's Tax Returns is Mitt Romney willing to lie to the People about? Maybe now Major Garrett can answer the caller's questions: why we should believe Romney is telling the truth about anything he says about his Tax Returns when Mitt was caught lying on and about his 1999-2001 Tax Returns?</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1348959434500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 18:57:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348959874074-31</Id><Topic><Title>DUMBO!

Try it some time, it's a REAL hoot. When I moved from Ohio to MA I had to declare Ohio as my Residence on my MA tax returns, since I didn't move to MA until late in the year, yet MA still was charging me income tax for that year on funds earned in MA, and Ohio also wanted those funds. Which gets them? It takes a tax lawyer to TRY to get it right, and even then they fail often. State laws on residency differ, and federal rules on determining domicile or homestead are a nightmare. Another note, "SPEAK OUT, DON'T SIT IN." is good advice, if the OWS people would have taken it they might have done as well as the Tea Party and actually have representatives running for Congress in this election. Instead they did it "the other way" and accomplished nothing but discrediting an otherwise worthy topic.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1348964197365</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 20:16:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348970738364-36</Id><Topic><Title>the #$%$ anti muslim film is not the reason for his arrest. neo loons and rightwing bigots just have their usual pantie wad fest to make political hay</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1348864647283</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 16:37:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey hadji...why don't you just sali beam your #$%$ on over to mecca</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1348970738364</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 22:05:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348973156669-37</Id><Topic><Title>What will you do when they come for you</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1348863635560</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 16:20:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'Residents' are people who live in a building.
