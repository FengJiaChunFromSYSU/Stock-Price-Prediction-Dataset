By a 228-14 vote, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said the administration lacked "clear and adequate evidence" that military action against Saddam Hussein would be morally justified. "We fear that to resort to war, under present circumstances and in light of current public information, would not meet the strict conditions in Catholic teaching for overriding the strong presumption against the use of military force," the prelates said.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1365513385776</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:16:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365513795107-2</Id><Title>Hillary pushed very hard for Iraq Invasion</Title><Msg>Hillary, John Kerry, Bill Clinton, Tom Daschle, Harry Reid and Al Gore all campaigned for Iraq Invasion.

The interview, published Tuesday by The Huffington Post, includes several swipes by the Senate leader at the GOP candidate. “His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son,” Reid said in reference to George Romney’s decision to turn over 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968. Reid suggested that Romney’s decision to withhold tax information would bar him from ever earning Senate confirmation to a Cabinet post. Then, Reid recalled a phone call his office received about a month ago from “a person who had invested with Bain Capital,” according to The Huffington Post. Reid said the person told him: “Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years.” “He didn’t pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that’s true? Well, I’m not certain,” Reid told HuffPo. “But obviously he can’t release those tax returns. How would it look?” Neither Reid nor his aides would identify the alleged investor, HuffPo reported.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1365520850757</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 11:20:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365522118595-9</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary pushed very hard for Iraq Invasion</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1365513795107</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:23:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pre-War Quotes from Democrats "Together we must also confront the new hazards of chemical and biological weapons, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them. Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them." President Clinton, Jan. 27, 1998. "Fateful decisions will be made in the days and weeks ahead. At issue is nothing less than the fundamental question of whether or not we can keep the most lethal weapons known to mankind out of the hands of an unreconstructed tyrant and aggressor who is in the same league as the most brutal dictators of this century." Sen. Joe Biden (D, DE), Feb. 12, 1998 "It is essential that a dictator like Saddam not be allowed to evade international strictures and wield frightening weapons of mass destruction. As long as UNSCOM is prevented from carrying out its mission, the effort to monitor Iraqi compliance with Resolution 687 becomes a dangerous shell game. Neither the United States nor the global community can afford to allow Saddam Hussein to continue on this path." Sen. Tom Daschle (D, SD), Feb. 12, 1998 "Iraq is a long way from [here], but what happens there matters a great deal here. For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." Madeleine Albright, Feb. 18, 1998. "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb. 18, 1998.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1365522118595</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 11:41:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365522332137-10</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary pushed very hard for Iraq Invasion</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1365513795107</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:23:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998. "As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations. Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998. "Hussein has ... chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies." Madeleine Albright, Clinton Secretary of State, Nov. 10, 1999. "This December will mark three years since United Nations inspectors last visited Iraq. There is no doubt that since that time, Saddam Hussein has reinvigorated his weapons programs. Reports indicate that biological, chemical and nuclear programs continue apace and may be back to pre-Gulf War status. In addition, Saddam continues to refine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer-range missiles that will threaten the United States and our allies." Letter to President Bush, Signed by Sen. Bob Graham (D, FL) and others, Dec, 5, 2001. "We begin with the common belief that Saddam Hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region. He has ignored the mandate of the United Nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them."</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1365522332137</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 11:45:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365522468096-11</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary pushed very hard for Iraq Invasion</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1365513795107</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:23:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Without question, we need to disarm Saddam Hussein.

For this reason OCD has often been likened to a disease of pathological doubt, in which the sufferer, though not usually delusional, is often unable to realize fully which dreaded events are reasonably possible and which are not.[citation needed] There are severe cases in which the sufferer has an unshakeable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from psychosis.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1365534426112</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 15:07:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365534508868-26</Id><Topic><Title>The beginning of the Real Bull market just</Title><Username>arcanos70</Username><Timestamp>1365523762777</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 12:09:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go outside and get some fresh air.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1365534508868</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 15:08:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365534711178-27</Id><Topic><Title>Senators were told Iraqi weapons could hit U.S.</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1365515355567</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 09:49:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another allegation? No one in Bain Capital filed Romney's tax returns. No one in my company files my returns either. IRS is in full control of all tax returns. No one except IRS has access to my tax returns unless I am a felon and my return is requested by course of investigation. I can release my forms at my own will. If IRS didn't file suit against Romney, that means the agency doesn't have problems with Romney tax filings. Someone knows someone who knows someone who knows something is not a proof of anything. It's a shame that Anderson Cooper even brings this #$%$ on air. Not paying any taxes is a felony and punishable under US law with fines and prison time. None of that was reported for Romney.

That’s one in six Americans, and one in five American children** What is ironic is that Barry and Ben's policies have hurt the poor and made the rich richer. Of course he hasn't noticed, old Barry and Michelle have been to busy throwing lavish parties at the Whitehouse on the backs of the poor. Poverty Plagues Obama’s America For a moment, let's forget about who is president and just look across the country. Today, 21 and a half million Americans are unemployed or underemployed—about twice as many as six years ago, according to NPR. Work-force participation, a fancy term for the number of Americans either working or looking for work, has dropped to “the lowest level since the malaise of the late 1970’s,” an era when far fewer women were working, according to MSNBC. Yes, the unemployment rate dropped last month—but only because so many people simply gave up looking for work. The dirty little secret is that after only four weeks of not looking for a job, an unemployed worker stops being counted. So far as the jobless numbers are concerned, that person ceases to exist. But, of course, they do exist and continue to be counted in other, troubling statistics: More than 16 million Americans have been added to the food stamps rolls since Barack Obama was first elected—a 46 percent increase and greater than the population of Ohio. More than 50 million Americans now live in poverty. That’s one in six Americans, and one in five American children.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1365535332194</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 15:22:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365535832688-31</Id><Title>Norfolk, VA - Air Force!</Title><Msg>Squadrons of Fighter Jets, Bombers, Airborn Warning and Control Aircraft getting grounded because of "SPENDING CUTS"!

West Virginia Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller, one of the towering architects of Obamacare, on Tuesday openly criticized program managers for not moving quickly enough to build the system, warning that if it gets off to a bumpy start it will just get worse. Decrying the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as way too complex, he warned the acting Medicare director that Obamacare is "so complicated and if it isn't done right the first time, it will just simply get worse." The retiring senator also told Marilyn Tavenner at her Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services that Obamacare rivals tax reform in its capacity to confuse Americans. "I believe that the Affordable Care Act is probably the most complex piece of legislation ever passed by the United States Congress. Tax reform obviously has been huge too, but up to this point it is just beyond comprehension," said Rockefeller.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1365546717770</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 18:31:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365549054523-45</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare architect...it will just get worse</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1365546717770</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-09 18:31:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bidder.......mark my words, this whole Obimbocrap is going to collapse!

Any taxes. Paying $0 tax from millions in income even with all given tax breaks and loopholes is nearly impossible unless you mean something fishy. There was no additional clarification given for this statement by Reid. He let it in the air for anyone to interpret what it means. Now, go ahead and ask a college student who went in droves to vote for Obama, but never filed a single tax form, what "didn't pay any taxes" means. Ask same question a housewife who knows nothing about taxes. In the minds of tens of millions not paying any taxes presumes illegality. Now, I don't care what Harry Reid meant to say. Fact is, this unfunded allegation influenced millions. Reid must resign for spreading misinformation to american public. But he didn't pay any price. In Romney's case I would file a law suit. The burden of proof is not on Romney. He still doesn't have to disclose anything, not a single line of his tax forms.
