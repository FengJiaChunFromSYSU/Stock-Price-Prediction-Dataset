All da Ryan pick did is to further solidify da undecideds, i.e., there's less to change their minds now than before, bad news for R&amp;R. I can understand why Romney did it, pick Ryan, he was failing in da polls. Bro Romney needed ca$h so he turned to his extreme right wing. Big mistake. Da Pubs biggest demographic in da mid terms was senior men, especially Catholic men, giving Da Pubs at least a 60:40 margin there, 65:35 among Catholics. Bro Romney still has a lead among senior men, but, now it's closer to 55:45. Oh, and among senior women he's losing. Even Cathoilc women are at 50:50. Bottom line folks, if y'all wanna stop Obama's march to socialism, give to da House &amp; Senate campaigns and forget da Presidential election. It's all over but da counting and court challenges. C Yaz - Da Bear Cares [CGDGE] ( I seriously doubt that Romney would have won regardless of who he picked, people can be made to hate a rich man. Without Ryan, however, it would have been closer and da Pubs had a better chance of picking uppity Da House &amp; Senate.

This is the theoretical value for a takeover. Here is the definition: "Think of enterprise value as the theoretical takeover price. In the event of a buyout, an acquirer would have to take on the company's debt, but would pocket its cash. EV differs significantly from simple market capitalization in several ways, and many consider it to be a more accurate representation of a firm's value. The value of a firm's debt, for example, would need to be paid by the buyer when taking over a company, thus EV provides a much more accurate takeover valuation because it includes debt in its value calculation." What do you all make of this. YAHOO FINANCE says $9.6 billion.</Msg><Username>CityBlade</Username><Timestamp>1345647748000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:02:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345648676000-10</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC'S ENTERPRISE VALUE........</Title><Username>CityBlade</Username><Timestamp>1345647748000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:02:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So, if your enterprise theory is correct then etfc would be trading 400% above the price today.

If the movie is anything like its source material, we can expect it will be a mostly fraudulent journey. The movie is based on Dinesh D'Souza's book The Roots Of Obama's Rage, which received high praise from people like Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh, neither of whom have shown any qualms about promoting outright lies, distortions, and outlandish claims in the past. The New York Times reports that the film is partially financed by billionaire investor Joe Ricketts, who previously considered financing a multimillion dollar political ad campaign linking the racially charged rhetoric of Rev. Jeremiah Wright to President Obama. The central thesis of the book is that Obama has some sort of anti-colonial world view, handed down to him by his ancestors, that acts as the motivation behind his actions and policies as president. It is just another form of birtherism, albeit a more highbrow variety of the ongoing conservative conspiracy theory. Appearing on Beck's Fox show, D'Souza explained: Obama is not anti-American in that he wishes ill on America. He wants what's best for America. He thinks it's really bad for us to be a colonial power. And therefore, in his view, he is doing right for America by pulling us out, by knocking us off our pedestal, by in a sense taking us from being the world's arrogant superpower. He wants us to share the wealth. He thinks he's gonna get a better America. The problem is, he's stuck in this theory, he's frozen in this time machine. In a sense, he's a captive of the ideology of a Luo tribesman from the 1950s. It's an incredible idea. D'Souza boosts this ludicrous premise (Obama ran for the presidency because he hates colonialism ... just like America's founders!) using several claims that are simply not rooted in reality. A few examples: ■D'Souza claims that TARP and the federal bailout were programs that "Obama launched." Both programs began under the Bush administration. ■D'Souza claims Obama went by the name Barack to adopt his father's "African identity," but Obama has explicitly said his name change "was not some assertion of my African roots." ■D'Souza insists that references in Obama speeches to a "nuclear-free world" are evidence of "anti-colonialism," but Ronald Reagan made multiple references to the same concept. ■D'Souza claimed that Obama supported the release of the Lockerbie bomber because he sometimes "supports the release of terrorists who claim to be fighting wars of liberation against American aggression." But the Obama administration formally opposed the release in an official letter from the State Department. ■D'Souza claimed that Obama referred to BP as "British Petroleum" in a May 2010 speech. He never did. And D'Souza just goes on and on, inventing incidents that never happened, making historical claims that don't match up to the facts, shoehorning these made-up stories into a false narrative of racial resentment. It doesn't appear that D'Souza has corrected or amended his flawed premise. 2016: Obama's America is just repeating the same falsehoods with moving pictures."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345667158000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 16:25:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345668235000-35</Id><Topic><Title>gals, if you're pregnant it wasn't rape</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345655698000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 13:14:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>99% of the debate rests upon when you consider it to be a person.

Mitt Romney’s policies on women’s rights, there is little to distinguish the Republican presidential candidate from the more radical elements of his party. The many examples of waffling by Gov. Romney are nothing more than attempts to obfuscate his true positions and claim that he is a moderate regarding social issues when he most certainly is not. Here’s the real truth about Gov. Romney’s anti-woman agenda: Whether we’re talking about women’s health, reproductive rights, or economic independence, he would take women backward. Mitt Romney: Bad for women’s health Women’s health has been under constant siege since Republicans overtook the House of Representatives and state governments in the 2010 midterm elections. The Republican record includes the all-male congressional panel debating insurance coverage for contraception, 33 attempts to repeal the health reform law and all of its benefits for women, vaginal probes in Virginia, and efforts to defund Planned Parenthood clinics around the country. Throughout the course of the Republican primary and into the general election, Gov. Romney has made it clear that he’s happy to lead this charge. Romney would repeal Obamacare and its critical protections for women’s health If elected president, perhaps the most damaging thing Gov. Romney could do to women’s health is repeal the Affordable Care Act, which Gov. Romney vows to do “on Day One” of his presidency. Why is this important to women’s health? Due largely to the high cost of health insurance coverage—especially for women without access to employer-based coverage—19 million American women between the ages of 18 and 64 were uninsured in 2011. And women of color comprise 36.3 percent of women in the United States, but disproportionately make up 53.2 percent of uninsured women. Uninsured women typically receive lower-quality care when they enter the health system, and they generally have poorer health outcomes than insured women.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345692459000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:27:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345692515000-57</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot's assault on women</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345692459000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:27:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Moreover, whether insured or not, women tend to have higher out-of-pocket costs than men: Women of reproductive age spend 68 percent more than men on health care expenses. And more than half of American women report delaying needed medical care because of cost, while one-third of women report giving up basic necessities such as food, heat, or rent to pay for health care expenses. (see Figure 1) women report their health decisions are affected by cost Women without employer-based insurance coverage have it particularly hard in the so-called individual health insurance market, which discriminates against women in numerous ways and which Gov. Romney wants to maintain. Women are often charged much more for their health insurance coverage solely because of their gender, a practice known as gender rating. In fact, women currently pay $1 billion more than men each year in health insurance premiums in the individual market for the same benefit. While these women pay more, they get less. Many insurance plans in the individual market do not meet their basic needs. For instance, only 12 percent of individual plans cover maternity care—care that only women need—and even then those plans may impose long waiting periods and high deductibles that make the coverage meaningless.Insurers also routinely deny women coverage for gender-related pre-existing conditions such as breast cancer, a Cesarean section, domestic violence, or sexual assault. Obamacare remedies sex discrimination in the insurance market by requiring coverage for maternity care, prohibiting gender rating, and eliminating pre-existing condition exclusions. Obamacare also makes health care more affordable by guaranteeing no-cost coverage for recommended preventive services such as mammograms, Pap smears, well-baby care, contraception, gestational diabetes screening, lactation supports, and much more. Approximately 47 million women will have access to women’s preventive services without cost-sharing under the Affordable Care Act, including 5.1 million African American, 4.9 million Latina, 2.5 Asian American, 300,000 American Indian, and 800,000 other American women.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345692515000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:28:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345692556000-58</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot's assault on women</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345692459000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:27:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Women also benefit from other financial protections in Obamacare because they use the health care system more for their own needs and for those of their families. The health reform law makes insurance more affordable by providing tax credits to those who need help paying their premiums and by expanding eligibility for Medicaid. Women of color will benefit in particular from expanded insurance coverage as they face disproportionately high rates of a range of health conditions, including heart disease, hypertension, obesity, certain forms of cancer, and diabetes. In addition, recent studies of Medicaid expansions have been shown to significantly bring down mortality rates, especially for nonwhite enrollees. Obamacare established a number of other financial protections. Insurers must send rebates to enrollees if the company spends less than 80 percent of premiums of paying for health care services. The law has eliminated lifetime caps on coverage and is phasing out annual caps. Nearly 40 million women, especially those with chronic conditions, have already benefited from the ban on lifetime limits. And new health insurance plans will have to cap co-pays and deductibles, which will help reduce the amount women pay in out-of-pocket expenses. Finally, Obamacare gives women peace of mind. Plans can no longer kick someone off when they get sick or because they made an honest mistake in their application. Children can no longer be denied coverage for a childhood illness. And young adults can stay on their parents’ plans until age 26. Gov. Romney wants to take these benefits away. In addition to promising to repeal Obamacare, he has endorsed the proposed Republican budget put forth by the budget committee chairman in the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan (R-WI). Not only did he endorse Ryan’s budget, he then named Rep. Ryan as his running mate. The Ryan budget dismantles the Affordable Care Act in a number of ways and would: Eliminate the ban on pre-existing condition exclusions Scrap the requirement that insurers allow young people to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26 End regulations that prohibit lifetime caps on coverage Do away with health insurance premium subsidies for low-income Americans Torpedo the guarantee for no-cost preventive services such as well-woman care, childhood vaccinations, and flu shots This is no way to help women improve health care for themselves and their families, yet Gov. Romney is fully supportive of the Ryan budget.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345692556000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:29:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345693145000-59</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot's assault on women</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345692459000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 23:27:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read and learn.
