"The Bible runs his life "not just on Sunday, but just about every day," he said in his annual State of the State address in February. "I can't look at the disabled, I can't look at the poor, I can't look at the mentally ill, I can't look at the addicted and think we ought to ignore them," he told lawmakers. But fellow party members don't seem willing to make a leap of faith. Republicans overwhelmingly control both the Ohio House and Senate. They're leery of expanding government programs and fear being stuck with any long-term costs. The Senate, where Republicans hold 23 of 33 seats, is critical." John Kasich (R) governor Ohio....... in support of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion WASHINGTON (AP) — It's Republican vs. Republican in the latest round of political battles over health care. Conservative Republican legislators in major states are trying to block efforts by more pragmatic governors of their own party to accept health insurance for more low-income residents under President Barack Obama's health care law.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370093542336</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 09:32:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370098218243-8</Id><Title>National registry needed</Title><Msg>"The National Rifle Association has suffered a rare setback in its crusade to block new gun regulations after a federal appeals court allowed the US government to go ahead with a plan to reduce the smuggling of semi-automatic weapons across the Mexican border. The new rules, introduced by Barack Obama under his executive powers in July 2011, require gun dealers located in states abutting the border to report to federal officials any multiple sales of semi-automatic rifles such as AK-47s to individuals within a five-day period. The administration presented the requirement as a justified move to "detect and disrupt the illegal weapons trafficking networks" operating in Mexico. The obligation to report such multiple sales would apply to all gun dealers in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas in an attempt to cut off the supply of military-style weapons being smuggled into Mexico. The north of Mexico is being sapped by a virtual war between law enforcement and drug cartels. But the NRA under the leadership of Wayne LaPierre vociferously objected to the plan, complaining that the measure was a ruse by Obama to introduce a register of gun sales via the back door. The NRA lodged a lawsuit seeking to block the new regulations. It was supported by its sister pro-gun rights group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is based in Newtown, Connecticut, the scene of the Sandy Hook school tragedy where 20 young children and six of their carers were killed in a mass shooting last December."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1370098218243</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 10:50:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370100243510-9</Id><Title>WalMart Costs Taxpayers $900,000 Per STORE !!!</Title><Msg>Walmart wages are so low that many of its workers rely on food stamps and other government aid programs to fulfill their basic needs, a reality that could cost taxpayers as much as $900,000 at just one Walmart Supercenter in Wisconsin, according to a study released by Congressional Democrats on Thursday.</Msg><Username>biddermoron_ca</Username><Timestamp>1370100243510</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 11:24:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370103196401-10</Id><Topic><Title>republican scandal fest gets no traction</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369427657831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 16:34:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AG Eric Holder is still in office! rowdyrodent eat your heart out.</Msg><Username>hunterspoint</Username><Timestamp>1370103196401</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 12:13:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370108542457-11</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary-Dumbo scandal fest gets major traction</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369429062593</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 16:57:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hillary-Dumbo corrutocracy is now doing major damage to their suckability poll numbers.</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1370108542457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 13:42:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370113737020-12</Id><Topic><Title>republican scandal fest gets no traction</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369427657831</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 16:34:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and you do not seem to get that this has nothing to do with tax free status either based on your comment "(not just tax exempt status) challenged".
