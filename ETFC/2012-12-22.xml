Yeah. He spent few hundred days "vacationing"! In Crawford. Been there? Haven't seen this place on the list of recommended resorts. Who really wants to spend that much time in 100F heat? He never played golf after 9/11 either. Why? He felt it would be inapropriate. Our current president though beat all golfing records, spends his vacations .in the most extravagant places. And I souldn't complain. Cause our dear leader did such a darn good job? By doing exactly what? Sending extra 15 million to live on food stamps and driving the nation's debt to sky high levels. Well, of course none of that is his fault, it's always the other guy. But still, just a little modesty is too much to ask? He is spending our tax money, not his own. Oh, those millionaires. My boss makes a lot of money.What's his fault?</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1356161299210</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 02:28:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356200524311-2</Id><Title>GM workers to get bonuses after 40 billion loss on stock buy back</Title><Msg>What a country! **GM workers can expect bonuses of between $5,500 and $7,000** Nice Bonuses For Ford, GM United Auto Workers’ Members Profit-sharing bonuses for United Auto Workers’ members at Ford Motor Co.

The hunger strike began Tuesday and is expected to end late Saturday, according to The Washington Post. Six former and current postal workers, part of a group called Communities and Postal Workers United, are calling the strike “six days starving to save six-day delivery.” Their goal is to stop Congress from reducing postal delivery to five days a week. “We have to be on guard, to raise awareness and pressure the decision-makers as they wrangle back-room deals,” group spokesman Jamie Partridge, a retired letter carrier from Portland, said in a statement. The agency lost $16 billion in fiscal year 2012, and needs to cut around $22.5 billion from its annual budget by 2016.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1356217267726</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 18:01:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356227958995-6</Id><Title>Pig Chronicles</Title><Msg>Hello boys and girls,,, In the past, as I slammed,,,, ummmm, George,,,,, I recall saying for instance, that I was too old to ‘learn a new tap-dance’; that engineering ‘was my plan’; etc., blah, blah, blah,,,, Well, dammit, I went and learned a new ‘tap-dance’,,,, fer I was thinkin’ that I couldn’t dance at all,,,, alas,,,,,,,, Yep, here it is,,,, (((Drum-roll please))),,,, I went and got my CDL Semi Truck Driving License.
