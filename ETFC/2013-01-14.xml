The constant itself is no doubt a deeply hidden White House economic secret, not to be disclosed to the public, along with his entire "jobs" plan.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358181390534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 11:36:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358182384676-2</Id><Title>For 4 whole years Obama has solved exactly nothing</Title><Msg>The people who voted for him should hide their heads in shame.

Expect similar result when you ask a hard question: who is the speaker of the House. Yeah. Someone who has no idea how/where to get an ID card has a right to vote too. And G-d forbid to ask ID in the voting booth. That's what gave Obama 3.5M extra votes to win, That's who Obama wants to be right where they are, in darkness.

Short term fix to a long term trend of folks with means moving out and millions of poor people moving in. All that will be left is poor Mexicans, pensioners, and everybody to stupid to "get it" in the middle will be paying for it all. I had no idea thet you resided in California, if not you should come on out and join in all the fun.

With 47million people and one out of four children on food stamps in the US...I would say is that his policies are only helping the folks with capital to invest... He is a banker after all. BTW, have you noticed gas prices as of late at the pump...another consequence of his dollar policy. The dollar dropped Thursday, pushing the euro up by the most since September, after comments from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi lowered expectations that an interest-rate cut will be coming soon. “He sounded rather upbeat on the economic outlook,” said David Song, an analyst at DailyFX. “Market participants took it as a signal that the ECB would hold off on any additional rate cuts for the time being.” The ICE dollar index /quotes/zigman/1652083 DXY -1.01% , which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell to 79.678 from 80.514 late Wednesday.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358197958854</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 16:12:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358201831128-11</Id><Title>America's greatest 21st century president</Title><Msg>BOOOOOOOOSSHH!
