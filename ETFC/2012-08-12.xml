Selecting Ryan is a declaration of war on seniors. Here's da problem for Mitt. Ryan's Plan: 1) 20% across da board tax cut on W-2 2) Slash benefits on Medicare for Seniors to pay for it. 1st: Most olde people on Medicare (65+) probably have no Federal tax obligation, since they already paid their payroll tax on SS &amp; Medicare over 30-40 years. Therefore, they get no benefit from Ryan's 20% tax reduction, only a huge increase in medical costs to pay for da tax cut for W-2. 2nd: Da average cost for Medicare for all seniors is about $9,000 per person per year. Under a "coupon" private plan, very few seniors would qualify for insurance, especially if Obamacare were trashed, since da premiums on 70+ would exceed $12,000, less a $3,000 coupon from Ryan. What senior in their right mind would vote for that, huh? Twenty % tax cuts for da rich and 75% increases in da cost of senior medical costs for da poor. Comon, gimme a break.

Analysis of the resulting comprehensive News21 election fraud database turned up 10 cases of voter impersonation. With 146 million registered voters in the United States during that time, those 10 cases represent one out of about every 15 million prospective voters. “Voter fraud at the polls is an insignificant aspect of American elections,” said elections expert David Schultz, professor of public policy at Hamline University School of Business in St. Paul, Minn.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344745665000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 00:27:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344745689000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan plan already abandoned</Title><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344742285000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 23:31:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea, you're probably right.

Republican: We wanted to suppress black votes Source: Salon In the debate over new laws meant to curb voter fraud in places like Florida, Democrats always charge that Republicans are trying to suppress the vote of liberal voting blocs like blacks and young people, while Republicans just laugh at such ludicrous and offensive accusations. That is, every Republican except for Florida’s former Republican Party chairman Jim Greer, who, scorned by his party and in deep legal trouble, blew the lid off his what he claims was a systemic effort to suppress the black vote. In a 630-page deposition recorded over two days in late May, Greer, who is on trial for corruption charges, unloaded a litany of charges against the “whack-a-do, right-wing crazies” in his party, including the effort to suppress the black vote. In the deposition, released to the press yesterday, Greer mentioned a December 2009 meeting with party officials. “I was upset because the political consultants and staff were talking about voter suppression and keeping blacks from voting,” he said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. He also said party officials discussed how “minority outreach programs were not fit for the Republican Party,” according to the AP."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344746432000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 00:40:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344776192000-9</Id><Topic><Title>My neighborhood odumbomites</Title><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1344457137000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 16:18:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well...guess what..yesterday i found the odumbomite neighbor was a vegan...who woulda thought...lol...anyway i had to dig out my old t-shirt to mess with him a little bit...it says "i love animals...they taste so good" he didn't appear to see much humour in it....anyway he has a couple of dogs he lets run loose in the neighborhood....i told him him to keep them on a leash or confined to his property...he said they were born to run free...i let him know they were chasing the kids on their bikes and could cause an accident or even bite the kids, opening up big liability for him....he told me it wasn't his dogs..i told him i know it was....in a serious tone, he said it's impossible..his dogs don't ride bikes...i just shook my head laughing...then called the animal shelter.....</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1344776192000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 08:56:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>17</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344776904000-10</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan plan already abandoned</Title><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344742285000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 23:31:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ryan's Plan: 1) 20% across da board tax cut on W-2 2) Slash benefits on Medicare for Seniors to pay for ________________________________________ the tax cuts are up front, the medicare spending cuts are in the Future......The medicare cuts wont touch most of the boomers.......anyone aged 55 or so now</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1344776904000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 09:08:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344778697000-11</Id><Title>Ryan will lower Mitt's income tax to 0.82%</Title><Msg>Nice, Mitten's is going to lower his income tax going forward to about ZERO%......

Romney vowed the duo would "preserve" Medicare, an eye-popping claim considering Ryan wants to transform the program from the ground up. Not all the rhetoric fit neatly with reality or with the record when Romney introduced his Republican vice presidential choice to the nation Saturday. A look at some of the claims by the Wisconsin congressman and Romney, and how they compare with the facts. ROMNEY: "Unlike the current president, who has cut Medicare funding by $700 billion, we will preserve and protect Medicare and Social Security and keep them there for future generations." THE FACTS: You could fill an arena with all the details left out in this statement. Ryan's reputation as a fiscal conservative is built on a budget plan that would overhaul the Medicare program and introduce a voucher-like plan that future retirees could use to buy private health insurance. Whether that results in a better or worse situation for Medicare recipients is a matter of debate. But under Ryan's plan, traditional Medicare would no longer be the health insurance mainstay, just one of many competing options. (See Romney's full remarks at left). The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the Ryan plan — which Romney endorsed in broad strokes in the past — would slow the increases in money for seniors. A typical 66-year-old would receive about 35 percent more than last year — $7,400 in 2011 dollars. Under current law, that person would probably receive at least 56 percent more in 2030, and quite possibly 75 percent more — $9,600 in 2011 dollars. The CBO said his plan grows spending for Medicare enrollees "at a much slower rate" than under current law or other policy scenarios. In Washington, a slower increase in spending is tantamount to a spending cut. Romney's assertion that the team would preserve Social Security left out the fact that he proposes significant change. He would protect the status quo for people 55 and over but, for the next generations of retirees, raise the retirement age for full benefits by one or two years and reduce inflation increases in benefits for wealthier recipients. At least with this program, he has offered more specifics than President Barack Obama has in dealing with the entitlement's long-term financing shortfall, though neither has laid out a comprehensive solution.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344786242000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:44:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344786398000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Fact checking the Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344786242000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:44:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RYAN on Romney: "As governor of Massachusetts, he worked with Democrats and Republicans to balance budgets with no tax increases, lower unemployment, increase income and improve people's lives." THE FACTS: For a Massachusetts governor, balancing a budget is a requirement of state law. Ryan's claim that Romney didn't raise taxes to comply with Massachusetts' yearly balanced budget requirement is also misleading. While Romney didn't raise state income or sales taxes, he worked with the state's Democratic-controlled legislature to raise hundreds of millions of dollars through new or raised fees on marriage licenses, gun licenses and much more. Romney also closed what he called business tax "loopholes," raising between $350 million and $375 million annually for three years. Many in the Massachusetts business community said they saw the maneuver as a tax increase by a different name. And while Romney himself didn't raise income taxes, he benefited from a huge $1.1 billion tax hike passed by Democrats the year before he took office. It was responsible for roughly half of the deficit Romney helped cut in his first year in office.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344786398000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:46:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344786519000-19</Id><Topic><Title>Fact checking the Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344786242000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:44:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ROMNEY: "We offer solutions that are bold, specific, and achievable." RYAN: "The commitment Mitt Romney and I make to you is this: We won't duck the tough issues, we will lead." THE FACTS: So far, vital specifics are missing from Romney as he pledges broad cuts in federal spending, but more money for the armed forces, and significant tax cuts. He proposes to cap federal spending at 20 percent of gross domestic product by the end of a first term, an ambitious goal that is not fleshed out with the painful choices that will be necessary for that to happen. If current Social Security and Medicare beneficiaries are protected, domestic Cabinet agency budgets would have to take a hit in ways that could reshape government to its core. Health research, transportation, homeland security, education, food inspection, housing and heating subsidies for the poor, food aid for pregnant women, grants to local governments and national parks are among the programs that would be at risk of substantial cuts. Romney promises to cut a wide swath of spending by 5 percent immediately, but independent analysts say the cuts would have to be far deeper to meet budget goals and would be certain to meet stiff resistance in Congress. —-</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344786519000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:48:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344786647000-20</Id><Topic><Title>Fact checking the Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344786242000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:44:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RYAN on Obama: "And in his first two years, with his party in complete control of Washington, he passed nearly every item on his agenda, but that didn't make things better. " THE FACTS: Obama succeeded in achieving a stimulus plan, the automakers' bailout, his health care law, new rules in the financial services sector and more. But he had failures, too, a promised immigration overhaul and climate change legislation among them. Ryan's assertion that the Obama agenda "didn't make things better" is primarily a political judgment call. But no one seriously argues that the stimulus plan or the auto bailout made no difference at all. The question is whether such spending was worth the gains that were made. Obama's $800 billion-plus stimulus, enacted in February 2009, created both public-sector and private-sector jobs, even if not as many as its sponsors had hoped. The director of the Congressional Budget Office, Douglas Elmendorf, estimated that the stimulus saved or created more than 3 million jobs. Princeton University economist Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, estimated that the stimulus, together with the bank bailout started by President George W. Bush and continued by Obama, saved or created more than 10 million jobs. An earlier CBO analysis estimated that stimulus trimmed the unemployment rate by 0.7 to 1.8 percentage points. —- ROMNEY on Ryan- "And throughout his legislative career he's shown the ability to work with members of both parties to find common ground on some of the hardest issues confronting the American people." THE FACTS: Not exactly. Ryan enjoyed a reputation as a consistent, if occasionally plucky, conservative before Obama took office in 2008. Ryan was known for occasionally bucking his party on social issues and foreign policy. In 2007, for example, he voted with Democrats for a bill prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. He has also enjoyed a lifelong friendship with former liberal Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, whose father worked in the same office as Ryan's father in Janesville, Wis. But particularly since Obama's election, Ryan's been something of a no-compromise-congressman: He's emerged as a leading intellectual force in the conservative opposition to Obama, joined unanimous blocks of Republicans in opposing Obama's biggest pieces of legislation and given little ground in negotiations over the budget and the deficit. Budget blueprints he released in 2011 and 2012 as House Budget Committee chairman were viewed as anathema to rank-and-file Democrats because of their cuts to social programs, not as carrots designed to get bipartisan consensus. In 2011, he criticized the work of a bipartisan group of senators, known as the Gang of Six, who were working on a budget compromise of their own. Ryan did work with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon in 2011, on a proposal for changes to Medicare that would allow private plans to compete with Medicare. But Wyden was the only prominent Democrat to support that plan and, in the end, Wyden himself did not support Ryan's larger budget plans, which included the Medicare component, when they were released later in 2012. —-</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344786647000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:50:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344786678000-21</Id><Topic><Title>Fact checking the Wimp</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344786242000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:44:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>RYAN: "I'm proud to stand with a man who understands what it takes to foster job creation in our economy, someone who knows from experience, that if you have a small business — you did build that." THE FACTS: Ryan, like Romney and scores of Republicans in recent weeks, has used comments Obama made at July 13 campaign appearance in Virginia against him. But the rhetorical jab takes Obama out of context. Republicans have seized on only part of Obama's quote — "If you've got a business, you didn't build that" — but the full quote makes clear Obama is talking about the conditions that help businesses and individuals succeed, such as teachers and infrastructure. The more complete quote from Obama: "If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in roads and bridges. If you've got a business — you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get invented on its own.

And Conservative Elderly DISAPPROVE at the level of 54%. From Politico: http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79607.html In June 2011 a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey found that 58 percent of American adults opposed the Medicare idea, while just 35 percent said they supported. Among the elderly, the disapproval rate soared to 74 percent. Even among conservative voters, 54 percent disapproved. In the same month, a Pew Research Center poll found that 41 percent of Americans opposed turning Medicare into a voucher system, akin to Ryan’s plan, although 23 percent had no opinion. That poll also found that a majority of older Americans, 51 percent, opposed the idea. When Pew drilled down, it found that voters preferred Democrats handling of Medicare over Republicans by 10 points — 44 to 34 percent. Choosing Ryan could be a game changer all right: by bringing more elderly into the Obama camp.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344790669000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:57:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344791106000-27</Id><Topic><Title>Pubs, remember come november</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1344788948000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:29:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As always, Libtarts can show their support for the Brak-Biden ticket by simply inserting their penii in something that smells likeshit.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1344791106000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 13:05:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344791813000-28</Id><Topic><Title>The Right Wings Only Mentions Global Warming</Title><Username>mitt_wit</Username><Timestamp>1344784770000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 11:19:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Check this video of 131 years of climate records.

Romney's aides have stressed publicly in the 24 hours since Romney electrified conservatives with his choice that the pick was the governor's alone. They have been less forthcoming on the flip side: That much of his staff opposed the choice for the same reason that many pundits considered it unlikely — that Ryan's appealingly wonky public image and a personality Romney finds copasetic will matter far less than two different budget plans whose details the campaign now effectively owns. "Everybody was against [Ryan] to start with only Romney for," said one top Republican, who is skeptical of the choice and griped that Romney's top advisors have "been giving Mitt everything he wanted in this campaign." Romney, his advisor Beth Myers told reporters Saturday, met with a team of about a half-dozen key campaign advisors several times on the issue, and spoke to a wide circle of trusted allies; it's not unusual that there would be differences, or that the instinct of many would be to do no harm, and to keep the campaign focused on the economy and on Barack Obama. Romney's decision to roll the dice himself reflects a different side than often seen of the cautious candidate: A desire to surround himself with people he genuinely respects, and a confidence in his own political judgement. Ryan spent Sunday on the campaign trail with Romney, helping the candidate draw some of the largest and most enthusiastic crowds of the presidential cycle. He also passed some early tests with flying colors, proving an engaging and comfortable figure under the white hot national spotlight. A media that cast doubts on the basic qualifications of the last Republican running mate, the previously obscure Sarah Palin, to step into the office of the presidency has evinced no such doubts about the Wisconsin congressman, a familiar figure in Georgetown and New York. Some of the doubters, though, also see warning signals. Congressional candidates in difficult districts and Florida Republicans are not eager to debate Ryan's attachment to converting Medicare into a system of vouchers for workers under 55. The fact that Ryan's push to cut capital gains taxes, which Romney opposes, would reduce the presidential nominees own taxes to nothing has also gotten unwelcome attention. Another Republican in conversation with the campaign — though not a member of the inner circle of Romney advisers — said the early skeptics tended to be the political professionals, including consultants Stuart Stevens and Russ Schriefer, and pollster Neil Newhouse, while Myers, foreign policy advisor Dan Senor, and ultimately Romney himself favored Ryan. (Those involved declined to shed light on the campaign's most confidential conversations; and others, including Myers, disputed that characterization; she said Saturday she kept her opinion to herself.) The debate inside the campaign, sources and other media reports said, in fact took into account many of the same concerns about Ryan that were aired publicly. "Many close aides had been lobbying for the low-risk, nonobjectionable Pawlenty, arguing that the two could run as outsiders taking on Washington," Politico noted Sunday. And Romney's own aides, in conversations with reporters over the last day, have also made clear that the candidate himself, not his advisors, drove the Ryan choice, something they have put in the context of Romney's forceful leadership. "He made his decision to select Congressman Ryan," advisor Myers said. "It was his decision alone."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344827269000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 23:07:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344827385000-70</Id><Topic><Title>Wimp's VP choice imprudent</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344827269000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 23:07:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Some of the doubters, though, also see warning signals.

That was a good article from seeking alpha. I don't think Freiberg put any feelers out for a sale as he was hiding behind goldman sachs recommendation. Truly, given what is happening in the markets and the obvious consolidation need, etfc should be set up for a sale. The prime buyer would be scottrade as they strategically need etfc more than amtd. Scott faces the same pressures and some additional scale would help them immensly. They can combine the backrooms and carve out $300,000,000 to $500,000,000 in annual expenses and also gain some scale and reduced costs of clearing and wholesale transactions. For etrade to think they can tough it out in this challenging environment is foolish math.

As it happens, pollster Stan Greenberg ran a series of focus groups for Democracy Corps about a month ago on the Ryan budget, worth revisiting in light of this weekend's news. Swing voters were exposed to a series of arguments both for and against the budget, including direct quotes in favor from Ryan and Romney as well as criticisms from Democrats. The key finding: President Obama’s lead against Romney more than doubles when the election is framed as a choice between the two candidates’ positions on the Ryan budget – particularly its impact on the most vulnerable. The President makes significant gains among key groups, including independents and voters in the Rising American Electorate (the unmarried women, youth, and minority voters who drove Obama to victory in 2008). I encourage you to click through and read the whole thing if you haven't already. Overall, the study found that the moral argument against the Ryan plan is the most powerful. Voters are simply unwilling to support a budget that achieves deficit reduction by ending support for the poor and vulnerable, while turning around and giving millionaires a tax break. By far, the strongest messages all emphasize the basic understanding that we live in a moral country. These messages confront basic core principles—that we need to live in a moral country, that we should not punish children who are poor through no fault of their own, and that it is in our American character to help those who are less fortunate. Two-thirds of all voters found these messages compelling and more than a third said they were very convincing. That matches the critiques of many in the Catholic Church who declared that the Ryan budget was "not a moral document." There are implications for messaging. According to Greenberg, the most effective attacks against the budget are that it will push children into poverty, that it will end Medicare, and that it will cut taxes on millionaires while raising them on the lower class. The conclusion: The President starts out with a 3-point margin against Mitt Romney, 49 percent to 46 percent. When asked to judge the two candidates in a very narrow way—Romney’s support for the Ryan budget because it reflects his values and Obama’s opposition because of what it would do to the most vulnerable—the vote shifts. Obama wins a majority of voters (51 percent) and his margin more than doubles to 8 points (51 to 43 percent.) This is a significant finding."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344828722000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 23:32:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344828742000-74</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC will be sold around $16~18 per share very soon!!</Title><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1344807765000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 17:42:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You omitted "1".
