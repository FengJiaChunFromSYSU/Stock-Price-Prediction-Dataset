Republicans have never been better at comvincing Americans with lower incomes to vote in favor of benefits for the wealthiest. All they have to do is set up a scapegoat for all the problems facing the middle class - someone who "isn't like us," someone allegedly born in another country who doesn't even want America to succeed. Truth is, it's the Republicans who've been committed to failure for the past four years. They didn't want us to thrive, not with Obama at the helm. But by trying to undermine him, they've made progress difficult. And yet they have the nerve to complain that more hasn't been done under Obama, while pushing for tax breaks for the wealthiest even if that means getting rid of middle-class tax benefits like the Child Tax Credit. Republicans seek only to empower the wealthiest, charging critics of this policy with trying to punish exceptionalism. Frankly, exceptionalism is not just about money. When more people realize that, they'll vote out the frauds and stop believing the lies.

This one may be fatal, as it affects whatever base Romney might still have. While ostensibly on the program to hammer an ad being aired by a pro-Obama PAC in which a man blames Mitt Romney for losing his job and health insurance, and then his wife to cancer that would have been treated under his old insurance policy, Spokeswoman Saul said these words that were followed by a thunderclap of hands smacking foreheads around the nation. To that point, you know, if people had been in Massachusetts under Governor Romney’s health care plan, they would have had health care. Lord, lord, lord! The last thing conservatives want to talk about, even less than Romney's tax returns (because at least there, they have a common enemy in Sen. Harry Reid), is Romneycare's similarity to Obamacare. Saul's comment turns Romney into the conservative's worst nightmare! Their main complaint about Romney all the way back to the primary season was his implementation of Obamacare on a state level would make him an ineffective messenger on repealing the president's legislation. The editor of RedState.com, influential conservative blogger Erick Erickson put it this way: "This might just be the moment Mitt Romney lost the election. Wow." As governor of Massachusetts, Romney implemented a health-care legislation that features the same individual mandate provision of President Barack Obama's legislation that has come under constant fire from conservatives since it passed in 2009. Romney has, however, repeatedly stated that his health care legislation that featured the individual mandate would not be effective as a national model. And here, on Fox News, the "fair and balanced" network favored by the conservatives Romney needs to turn out en masse if he has a shot at winning in November, one of his chief spokespeople goes and makes the argument that Romneycare should be implemented nationwide by saying these nice people should have been in Massachusetts to get the kind of care they needed. These are the very same provisions Romney has vowed to repeal from Obamacare if he is elected. Slap. This latest self-inflicted wound comes the day after Romney referred to the Sikhs murdered by a white supremacist in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, on Sunday as "sheiks" and the same day as the Huffington Post released a story showing Romney started Bain Capital with money from families with ties to Central American death squads. If this is the Romney plan to get people to stop talking about his tax returns, it might just work."

But Romney suggested the standards aren’t the same for people and businesses. “I’m not a business,” he said. “We have a process in this country, which was established by law, which provides for the transparency which candidates are required to meet. I have met with that requirement with full financial ­disclosure of all my investments, but in addition have provided and will provide a full two years of tax returns.” This is the candidate who, almost exactly one year ago, got into a somewhat-heated exchange with a heckler in Iowa in which Romney made that case that “corporations are people” — that is, what happens to corporations affects the people who work for them. ------------------ Here is the latest Romney dodge as to why he is not releasing his tax returns, which is particularly noteworthy since he once vigorously asserted that "corporations are people."</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344526377000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 11:32:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344526617000-43</Id><Topic><Title>Wimp weaseling weakly</Title><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344526377000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 11:32:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Similar to Obama not wanting to release his Columbia school transcripts; deep secret(s) ?</Msg><Username>nysenaz</Username><Timestamp>1344526617000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 11:36:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344526884000-44</Id><Title>At least Kenny will look after us;</Title><Msg>he always has.

Bloomberg News The company ousted CEO Steven Freiberg Thursday, naming Chairman Frank Petrilli, a brokerage industry veteran, in his place for now. BGB Securities analyst Faye Elliot says the management change, recent board appointments and the continuing struggle of E*Trade signal that the company is at least “gearing up for a sale.” David Trone of JMP Securities also says the CEO change seems to show the board is “warming up to the idea.” Of course, it might not take much gearing up. E*Trade looked at selling itself last year after top shareholder Citadel and Ken Griffin pushed it to sell. There were bankers hired but in November the company decided not to sell The new board members, added earlier this year, are Rodger Lawson and Rebecca Saeger, two former financial services executives with experience at two of E*Trade’s main competitors, Fidelity Investments and Charles Schwab Corp. Petrilli himself was formerly head of TD Waterhouse and tied to Toronto-Dominion Bank, the 45% owner of TD Ameritrade, often cited as a potential buyer of E*Trade. Trone said today he continues to believe that deal is most likely. But BGB’s Elliot doesn’t have the highest hopes for a sale price: “Consider a steep haircut to ETFC’s mortgage book, hovering regulators, and the likely declining operating leverage going forward; little to no premium in our opinion.” E*Trade shares were up 6% to $8.52 in recent trading. TD Ameritrade was up 2% to $16.76, as Trone said a deal could boost its value. –Brett Philbin contributed to this post.</Msg><Username>brandish_mow</Username><Timestamp>1344535156000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 13:59:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344535237000-87</Id><Topic><Title>New report out: (ETFC)</Title><Username>starrxfl966</Username><Timestamp>1344521991000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 10:19:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow free of charge.

Another scenario is that they are close to a buyer making an offer. Firing the CEO sweetens the deal two ways: 1) Don't pay Freiberg any contractual bonus or sale commision. 2) Save money on new CEO "search" that is only going on in theory.

At least from 16 share to current levels. But looking back to 2006 this stock price was 34 times higher split adjusted than it is today. A market cap of 80+ billion vs. the 2.4 billion it is today. While citadel was a problem they also saved the company from a total collapse and so due credit has to be given for that. And..they wanted out of what they did and in retrospect..were wise to sell where they did. What happened to etfc? several things. The mortgage and banking crisis.. and competition in the industry being the two biggest factors. More recently a slowdown in trading and the market overall. Who's going to fix it? I don't know. It's definitely going to have to be someone with a keen eye towards cost cutting though because growth is going to be hard to come by. In retrospect the reverse split was a mistake even though i somewhat supported it at the time. I felt like they were doing it because they could and because it would help..not because they had to as most companies do. Turns out shorts and citadel didn't care. They sold anyway. I've stayed long my position however and averaged down to the 11's. Selling calls has helped as well. I'm down on it overall for sure but not as bad as i otherwise might be. I'm somewhat surprised a schwabb or atrade hasn't made a move on it. We're certainly cheap by their stocks standards. I just think though that they're in a mode of preserving cash and that hinders something that otherwise might have been a buyout. It would be a good fit though and so i remain somewhat hopeful. And that's probably how these players will survive..by ultimately consolidating. As for the CEO leaving..great. Who cares? He did nothing for the company except rake in his millions. Good that he's now gone and the door is open for someone who can perhaps better handle the situation. If it can be handled. We'll have to see. I think it's going to be tough. A weak market and a lot of competition and newer players even in the business doesn't bode well for growth. Personally..i'm just waiting and looking for my next good options play on it. At least selling calls brings some returns. In any event..do we blame citadel? maybe. Somewhat. But..we should also blame ourselves for not selling like they did. Or being in this at all for that matter following the reverse split. I'll be staying long this because i rarely like to sell anything. But I won't be happy about it i'm sure. ~TS</Msg><Username>tradestoxx11</Username><Timestamp>1344539153000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 15:05:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344539241000-109</Id><Topic><Title>Citadel is the problem</Title><Username>m_totten</Username><Timestamp>1344537926000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 14:45:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>want to thank you if you had anything to do with getting rid of the dead weight!!!IMHO</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1344539241000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 15:07:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344539655000-110</Id><Title>Etrade Savings not taking loan apps</Title><Msg>Just finished refi and saw that msg on website on Monday.

This company has suffered under poor leadership - the shareholders have taken it in the shorts. Wall street is great at spotting weakness and taking advantage of it. Here they saw a management team embarked on the wrong plan. Entirely WRONG. So they go with the flow and sure as shootin, they shorted it down to $7 bucks without a word from the management team. NOTHING. The Directors appear to have strong backgrounds (and perhaps thick wallets) and should have foreseen this calamity as well as known that the PPS would be attacked by shorts. But their callous disregard for shareholders got them to a $7 pps, facing headwinds that have NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE. Dummies, all of the directors are DUMMIES.

BLOW I smell desperation. It's one thing when campaign supporters and even surrogates issue scurrilous attacks on their candidate's opponent- both sides have done some of this - but it's another thing altogether when those accusations become a central line of attack stemming from the candidate himself. Earlier this week, Mitt Romney claimed that President Obama had moved to eliminate the work requirement for welfare recipients. Romney pushed the point in an ad with the narrator saying: On July 12, President Obama quietly announced a plan to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements. Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work and wouldn't have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check, and 'welfare to work' goes back to being plain old welfare. In person, Romney has repeated this claim over and over. The only problem is that it's not true. In fact, that assertion is misleading in myriad ways. Never mind that waivers from aspects of the federal welfare program were requested by the Republican governors of Nevada and Utah. Never mind that, as Talking Points Memo pointed out Tuesday: "In 2005, Romney and 28 other Republican governors wrote a letter to Congress requesting even more flexibility than Obama has offered, for the purpose of '[e]mpowering states to seek new and innovative solutions to help welfare recipients achieve independence.'" Never mind that "as governor, Romney offered welfare recipients free auto insurance, registration, inspections and memberships in AAA, " as Joe Klein noted, also on Tuesday. Setting all that aside, the memo in question bore little relation to Romney's provocative claims. It said, in part, that the Department of Health and Human Services: is issuing this information memorandum to notify states of the Secretary's willingness to exercise her waiver authority under section 1115 of the Social Security Act to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families. The memo continued: The Secretary is interested in using her authority to approve waiver demonstrations to challenge states to engage in a new round of innovation that seeks to find more effective mechanisms for helping families succeed in employment. In providing for these demonstrations, H.H.S. will hold states accountable by requiring both a federally-approved evaluation and interim performance targets that ensure an immediate focus on measurable outcomes.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344544523000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 16:35:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344544557000-127</Id><Topic><Title>Wimp's Blow out</Title><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344544523000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 16:35:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Furthermore: States that fail to meet interim outcome targets will be required to develop an improvement plan and can face termination of the waiver project. That's right, the Department of Health and Human Services was granting flexibility to states because it wanted to improve employment outcomes and H.H.S. promised to terminate the waiver if states didn't meet the targets. It is no wonder, then, that PolitiFact said of Romney's ad: The ad's claim is not accurate, and it inflames old resentments about able-bodied adults sitting around collecting public assistance. Pants on Fire! "Pants on Fire" is PolitiFact's worst rating. And the welfare claim comes on the heels of Romney accusing the president of filing a lawsuit "claiming it is unconstitutional for Ohio to allow servicemen and women extended early voting privileges during the state's early voting period." In reality, as Factcheck.org pointed out, "the Democratic lawsuit seeks to restore early voting 'for all Ohio voters,' " because "Ohio's GOP-controlled Legislature in 2011 limited early voting for nonmilitary residents." Politifact said that what voters got from the Romney campaign "is a falsehood." In other words, a lie. What could push a man to hang his hat on so sharp a nail? Fear, that's what. As we move into the conventions, the Republican candidate is still down in the polls - two recent surveys have deplorable favorability numbers for Romney. At this point, according to my colleague Nate Silver's blog, FiveThirtyEight, Obama is favored to win in November. Romney has to find a line of attack that works because there is a creeping feeling beginning to overtake part of the electorate that his candidacy is in trouble. The problem is that these sorts of desperate, baseless attacks only amplify the sense of panic.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344544557000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 16:35:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344544650000-128</Id><Topic><Title>new ceo 500k a month?

He will be eligible for an annual cash performance bonus with an annual target of $3,000,000 and for annual equity incentives with an annual target initial value of $3,000,000 (with the actual amount based on the performance of the Company) and subject to vesting over up to four years following the grant. For 2010 only, he will be guaranteed a pro rata payment of his target cash bonus and equity incentives, each to be made in early 2011. The term of the agreement is four years, subject to renewal at the end of the initial term. If Mr. Freiberg is terminated without cause or resigns due to adverse actions by the Company, and he signs a release of claims, he would receive severance benefits of one times his annual compensation (including salary, annual cash bonus and annual equity grant value) and accelerated vesting of equity, in addition to a pro rata payment of his cash bonus for the year of termination. If the termination occurs in anticipation of, or following, a change of control, his severance would be increased to two times his annual compensation. If Mr. Freiberg retires at the end of the four-year term of his agreement, he will be entitled to retain his unvested equity awards subject to his compliance with restrictive covenants over the scheduled vesting period of such awards.

Purpose of any religion is sheep management. Basically - government, but without accountability to it's people. Some religions have lofty goals - some don't. Most end up with sinister and petty agenda that serves it's leaders and control the crowd. Most religions have a dumb set of premises you have to believe in without a shred of proof and in some cases - with ample proof to the contrary. Some religions exceed in "dumb". Mormonism excels among those religions that already exceed in "dumb" - plus - I believe, most "religious scholars" (talk about an oxymoron) agree that Mormonism is a cult. Since I think religions in general are designed to fight knowledge and progress, and promote "conservative way of life" (aka - keep the dumb dumb), all I can do is tolerate them, AS LONG AS they do not teach and encourage violence to achieve their goals - whatever those may be. What I DO NOT EVER tolerate, is one group of religious sheep claiming superiority over another group of religious sheep solely on the premise that THEIR Sheppard is the only true and righteous Sheppard. Basically, if you just stick to chewing grass and stay away from charging at other sheep - I have no issue with you or your religion.</Msg><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1344567309000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 22:55:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344567789000-176</Id><Title>Who's Next?</Title><Msg>Trying like heck to put my finners on who's next.

Lets get our finners on the board minutes and the D&amp;0 policies and we will see who the smart guys are.</Msg><Username>brandish_mow</Username><Timestamp>1344568235000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:10:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344568550000-179</Id><Title>Ahhh Yes.

The maximum yearly contribution is now $6000 and in years 2002 through 2004 it was $3500. I figure he's got to have increased the value of his contributions at least 90 fold over the years. That's got Madoff beat! BTW I agree with those who think Reid is out of line. When Romney ran for Governor of Mass. he claimed the required citizenship on the basis that he had filed joint returns in Utah and the Commonwealth. When this assertion turned out to be a lie, the commonwealth required him to file tax returns retroactively. But all that was a matter of law. He is under no legal obligation to file federal returns.</Msg><Username>symmetric_prime</Username><Timestamp>1344569233000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:27:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344569429000-184</Id><Title>Citadel buyout</Title><Msg>Theory 1: Citadel is setting up etrade so they can buy out at $15ish n then take it private.</Msg><Username>perryk01</Username><Timestamp>1344569429000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:30:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344569656000-185</Id><Title>Rosemary's Baby</Title><Msg>KG is father freiberg is the mother.</Msg><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1344569656000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:34:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344569859000-186</Id><Topic><Title>Citadel buyout</Title><Username>perryk01</Username><Timestamp>1344569429000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:30:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They have to recover from their enourmous loss when they bought etrade at $42 back in 2007. Taking it private for themselves at the mid teens prices seems logical. They have sold a significant amounts of shares since the beginning of 2011 at around $15 pps. They can start buying it back at around these prices and then sumit offer.</Msg><Username>perryk01</Username><Timestamp>1344569859000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:37:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344569864000-187</Id><Topic><Title>Citadel buyout</Title><Username>perryk01</Username><Timestamp>1344569429000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 23:30:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They will be sued ifnthey only offer $15.

Porter - Co founder of E-Tub, 1998. Bro Porter set E-Tub uppity on da new tech business model, hype da price with limited shares, then cash out when da stinky stuff hits da fan. He followed da AWE rule on AT&amp;T Wireless, dump before everybody else beats ya to it. Da Greek Costakos - Co founder of E-Tub, 1998. After refusing to sell E-Tub when it was trading over $100 pre split, he tried to rob da joint of $80,000,000, demanding money from a crony BOD for being a "visionairy." Cost Dr. Costakos his job, and now he's broke in Greece. Mitch Caplan - dumb, dumb banker who became CEO when Da Greek got das boot. Set uppity an incentive system that paid em millions for taking risks (to da shareholders only) with E-Tub's capital. What did Yinz expect, huh? Mitch got rich, then got ditched. Next up, Da Harvard Boob, Kenny's boy. He did his job for his bossman, Kenny Da Griffin. Then, he retired to da golf course with millions in options. Oh, da stock was a disaster after his 2nd offering. Here it comes, wait for it....FREIBERG! Another banker. Guess how he worked out, huh? Anybuddy? NEXT? C Yaz - Da Bear Cares [CGDGE] ( I know, Yinz are hoping for a White Knight, err, Bro moon[P] probably a Black Knight. Whatever. I'd temper my enthusiasm based on past history.
