Now that the law has been passed, Romney has no plans to get rid of it, that adviser, Ed Gillespie, added. But Romney didn't support it while it made its way through Congress. "The governor would not repeal the Lilly Ledbetter Act," said Gillespie, following Tuesday night's presidential debate. "He was opposed to it at the time. He would not repeal it." The statement from Gillespie is the furthest that the Romney campaign has gone in detailing the candidate's position on the law, which allows women greater opportunity to sue over pay inequity at the workplace. Previously, the governor's campaign has said that he would not repeal the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which was the first bill President Barack Obama signed into law, while leaving unanswered whether or not he would have signed it had he been president at the time. The topic came up during the debate, with Obama criticizing Romney's campaign for demurring when asked about the legislation. "I just want to point out that when Governor Romney's campaign was asked about the Lilly Ledbetter bill, whether he supported it, he said, 'I’ll get back to you,'" Obama said. "And that’s not the kind of advocacy that women need in any economy." In the spin room after the debate, other Romney surrogates tried to skirt questions regarding the legislation, arguing that it was more valuable to look at how the candidate had constructed his staff while in public office. "Governor Romney feels that he is absolutely in favor of equal employment opportunity for women, equal pay for women. I don’t think he wants to be cornered into talking about this particular piece of legislation as a tool of a campaign," said Kerry Healey, who served under Romney as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts. "I think Governor Romney wants to be judged on his own record and how he has dealt with women in his administration and with women's issues throughout his career." But Gillespie's admission that Romney opposed the Lilly Ledbetter Act while it was being debated -- there is no evidence readily available showing Romney weighing in on the topic in the months before it was signed -- provided ample material for his critics. "Is that leadership?" said Cecile Richards. "If he was president, we wouldn't have equal pay. I think that's the point. He doesn't lift a finger to do anything for women."</Msg><Username>spenditol98_1</Username><Timestamp>1350484109563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 10:28:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350485292728-6</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on women</Title><Username>spenditol98_1</Username><Timestamp>1350484109563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 10:28:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rumney won 2 to 1 on the economy.

Guess what. It's #$%$. by Kaili Joy Gray Mitt Romney sure knows how to woo the ladies, doesn't he? In Tuesday night's debate—a full six months after his campaign evaded the simple question of whether he supports the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act—Romney still didn't have an answer. Instead, he had this: CROWLEY: Governor Romney, pay equity for women? ROMNEY: Thank you. And important topic, and one which I learned a great deal about, particularly as I was serving as governor of my state, because I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men. And I — and I went to my staff, and I said, "How come all the people for these jobs are — are all men." They said, "Well, these are the people that have the qualifications." And I said, "Well, gosh, can't we — can't we find some — some women that are also qualified?" Pause right there. Mitt Romney is a highly educated man. He's traveled the world. He's run a business. But it's only after he's elected governor that he realizes, gosh, all these jobs are for men? He'd somehow managed to live for more than half a century without noticing the absence of women in the halls of power—not to mention the boardrooms? Sure must be nice to be the rich white son of a governor. But let's continue: ROMNEY: And — and so we — we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet. I went to a number of women's groups and said, "Can you help us find folks," and they brought us whole binders full of women. Binders full of women. Yup. That was tonight's pitch to the lady voters. He once looked at some binders with women in them. Wow. Ooooh. Ahhhh. What a man. What a leader. What a feminist. What a guy chicks should totally vote for because binders. Just one teeny, tiny little problem with Mitt's "Vote for me 'cause binders!" pitch. As David S. Bernstein explains, it's #$%$: What actually happened was that in 2002 -- prior to the election, not even knowing yet whether it would be a Republican or Democratic administration -- a bipartisan group of women in Massachusetts formed MassGAP to address the problem of few women in senior leadership positions in state government. There were more than 40 organizations involved with the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus (also bipartisan) as the lead sponsor. They did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions. They presented this binder to Governor Romney when he was elected. I have written about this before, in various contexts; tonight I've checked with several people directly involved in the MassGAP effort who confirm that this history as I've just presented it is correct -- and that Romney's claim tonight, that he asked for such a study, is false. Got that? Mitt Romney didn't go out of his way to look for women. He didn't ask for anyone's help. He didn't say, "My goodness, where are the women?" The women came to him. They told him he needed to hire more women. And you know what he did, right? None of the senior positions Romney cared about -- budget, business development, etc. -- went to women. Goal Thermometer Secondly, a UMass-Boston study found that the percentage of senior-level appointed positions held by women actually declined throughout the Romney administration[.] Mitt Romney doesn't love women. He didn't go out of his way to hire them. He didn't give a good golly about filling his cabinet with women. And he still hasn't told us whether he supports equal pay for equal work. Mitt Romney is just like the rest of his fellow Republicans waging their War on Women. And it's time to end the war.</Msg><Username>spenditol98_1</Username><Timestamp>1350486293078</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:04:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350486602534-8</Id><Title>Young Man - You Are Doing a Great Service for Your Country By Getting A Higher Education</Title><Msg>and then moving back home so you can attend debates in the suit that you probably can't afford.</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1350486602534</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:10:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350486671782-9</Id><Topic><Title>wazzzz happening odumbomites????</Title><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1350422331887</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 17:18:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We were nervously sucking on Obombas large teleprompter while Romney was #$%$-slapping the punk.

He understands that when women are paid less than men for the same work, it hurts the entire family. Mitt Romney refused to say whether or not he would have signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law, and Paul Ryan voted against it. Ending health insurance discrimination President Obama is putting an end to the health insurance company practice of charging women more than men for the same coverage. Mitt Romney would let employers, insurance companies, and politicians limit women’s health choices. Women’s health and birth control Thanks to Obamacare, many insurance plans are beginning to fully cover birth control without co-pays or deductibles as part of women's preventive care—potentially saving women hundreds of dollars every year. Get the facts. Mitt Romney would repeal Obamacare, and give employers the authority to limit women’s access to common forms of birth control. Protecting women’s rights President Obama believes a woman’s health care choices are personal decisions, best made with her doctor—without interference from politicians. Mitt Romney believes that Roe v. Wade should be overturned, and backed an extreme proposal to outlaw abortions even in the case of incest and rape. Expanding access to health care President Obama fought back against Republican attempts to defund Planned Parenthood, one of the largest providers of women’s health services, including breast and cervical cancer screenings, and birth control. Under Obamacare, health insurance companies now cover recommended preventive care like mammograms and cancer screenings, and are beginning to cover birth control without co-pays or deductibles. Mitt Romney would eliminate all federal funding for Planned Parenthood, and roll back all the benefits of health reform.</Msg><Username>spenditol98_1</Username><Timestamp>1350488355465</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:39:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350488727236-11</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on women</Title><Username>spenditol98_1</Username><Timestamp>1350484109563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 10:28:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Mitt Romney raised eyebrows during the presidential debate Tuesday night when he claimed that as governor of Massachusetts, he had been so dismayed at the lack of female cabinet candidates that he sent women's groups out to find them. "I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' and they brought us whole binders full of women," he said. In fact, Romney did not direct women's groups to bring him female candidates, Boston Phoenix reporter David Bernstein points out. A non-partisan collaboration of women’s groups called Massachusetts Government Appointments Project (MassGAP) was responsible for the effort in 2002, when the group's leaders realized that women held only 30 percent of the top appointed positions in the state. Romney boasted that during his term as governor, Massachusetts had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America. "Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort," he said. This statement, too, is misleading. While 42 percent of Romney’s appointments during his first two and a half years as governor were women, the number of women in high-level appointed positions actually declined to 27.6 percent during his full tenure as governor, according to a 2007 MassGAP study.

We could call it a gaffe or a flip-flop or invoke some other euphemistic excuse from Very Serious Journalism dictionary, but let's not. The truth is, Mitt Romney is a liar. In the second presidential debate on Tuesday night, Romney said: I’d just note that I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives. And the President’s statement of my policy is completely and totally wrong. None of that is true. Romney does believe bureaucrats in Washington should decide who has access to contraceptives, and he does believe employers should also make that decision. We know this is true, because Romney supported the Blunt Amendment to allow employers to decide whether their employees should have access to contraceptives. That's what the Blunt Amendment did, and Romney said at the time, "Of course I support the Blunt Amendment." And Romney didn't just support the amendment; he joined his fellow Republicans in attacking the president for his policy to make birth control affordable and accessible to all American women—a policy Romney claimed, last night, to support when he said he too thinks all women should have access to contraceptives. In January, when the policy was first introduced, the Romney campaign said, "This is a direct attack on religious liberty and will not stand in a Romney presidency." To further appeal to the rabid Republican base, Romney also pledged to end Title X, which funds family planning programs. You know, contraception. When the policy was enacted in August and Republicans were hyperventilating that women having access to affordable birth control was just like 9/11 and Pearl Harbor Day, Romney released an ad accusing the president of declaring a war on religion. And let's not forget that Romney promised when it comes to Planned Parenthood, the largest provider of health care for women and specifically, the nation's largest and best resource for affordable birth control for women: Planned Parenthood, we're going to get rid of that. Romney does believe bureaucrats and employers should be making birth control decisions for women. He does not believe all American women deserve access to affordable birth control. And when the president said, during the debate, that Romney "suggested that in fact employers should be able to make the decision as to whether or not a woman gets contraception through her insurance coverage," he was absolutely accurate. Except that Romney didn't merely suggest it; he said, in no uncertain terms, that's the policy he supported. And then, like the rest of his despicable party, he accused the president of waging a war on religion for implementing a policy that all of a sudden, Romney supports. And then he has the audacity to say the president is "completely and totally wrong" about Romney's policy? The only question is, which policy, Mitt? The one where you want to defund our health care, support Washington bureaucrats vote on our access to birth control, and let our employers make our decisions for us? Or the policy where you'll say anything, even if it's a lie, to try to win the presidency?</Msg><Username>fritzinacrotchlesstutu</Username><Timestamp>1350489618705</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350489674335-13</Id><Topic><Title>Bami won the the second prez debate!!!</Title><Username>bami2012</Username><Timestamp>1350444200617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 23:23:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No doubt, the Prez won the second debate.</Msg><Username>bami2012</Username><Timestamp>1350489674335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:01:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350490629352-14</Id><Title>shineola is c#apping her pants</Title><Msg>A Frank Luntz focus group made up mostly of former Obama voters say they now support Mitt Romney.

I wrote before the first debate that the most important thing to look for would be presidential temperament. I said that temperament is hard to define, but it “is the strength of character that allows a president to stay on top of all the events and complexities and life-and-death challenges of the world’s most difficult job, and to remain open-minded and flexible and yet determined.” In the first debate, I saw more of that in Romney.

Well, now we know that just isn't the case. Since the debate, Gallup shows Romney moving from a two-point lead to a six-point lead. Today, Romney beats the president 51-45%. State polls, which are always lagging indicators, have also shown movement towards Mitt Romney. Absolutely nothing we've seen in those numbers indicates that Joe Biden's classless, childish, buffoonish debate performance did anything other than to ensure Mitt Romney's momentum kept right on keeping on. It's worth noting that today's Rasmussen poll only shows Romney up one, 49-48%. One possible explanation comes from NumbersMuncher, a smart poll analyst on the Twitter-nets. The thinking is that Gallup might be picking up an increase in Republican enthusiasm that Rasmussen isn't. Rasmussen weights his polls with a D+5 sample. That's a perfectly reasonable skew, but as Republicans come closer to the realization that we might actually have a chance at firing President FalureTeleprompter, Rasmussen might want to have another look. The only question now is what Obama's frantic performance at last night's debate might have done for enthusiasm on his side. If the media focus groups are any indicator, I would say not a whole lot as far as undecideds, who seemed more inclined to move towards Romney. As far as rank-and-file Democrats, they seem more relieved today than elated.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1350497664576</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 14:14:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350498471833-26</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes Magazine says Obama did better in the second debate</Title><Username>elksmember</Username><Timestamp>1350491825746</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:37:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All the community agitator did was raise the heat in the debate, which makes the debates less interesting with all the vitroil.

From the standpoint of a public pension, Obama is well-heeled. As president, he will receive $191,300 annually for life - win or lose in next month's election - and receives a travel allotment as well as mailing privileges. Should Obama lose, his presidential pension kicks in immediately after leaving office. Given that the president enjoys a normal life span, the pension allotment would be worth upwards of $6 million. The federal budget spends about $3 million annually for the four living ex-presidents. Obama also will get Secret Service protection. In addition, Obama may be due a nice pension for the eight years he served in the Illinois Legislature as a state senator. Illinois is infamous for its lavish pension plan for former lawmakers. But what about Romney? It's extensively documented that Romney is, well, a rich guy. He earned untold millions -though famously circumspect about releasing tax returns - while leading private equity giant Bain Capital and has a substantial retirement plan. His Individual Retirement Account could be worth in the neighborhood of $87 million, as documented in an extensive report from the Washington Post. But as for a strictly public pension? Zip, zero. Romney only served one term as governor of the Bay State and did not take a salary, so he is eligible for nothing.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1350510016757</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 17:40:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350511607346-34</Id><Title>CBS Poll: Who's is bigger, Mitt's or the Twit's?</Title><Msg>I don't look at my pension.</Msg><Username>maynardkrabs</Username><Timestamp>1350511607346</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:06:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350511681019-35</Id><Topic><Title>lying phony Mittens said he is for 100% of the people</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1350480427967</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 09:27:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whenever I read the header to your posts, fire shoots out of my #$%$.</Msg><Username>maynardkrabs</Username><Timestamp>1350511681019</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:08:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350512035637-36</Id><Title>Women favor Romney</Title><Msg>of the twenty top positions in the Romney administration, ten of them were filled by women, more than any other state in the nation. Romney's Chief of Staff was a woman - Beth Myers. As we took office, our administration actively sought to recruit the best and brightest women the Commonwealth had to offer. And Governor Romney wasn't just checking a box. He sought out our counsel, and he listened to our advice. We didn't always agree, but we were always respected. Mitt Romney didn't judge the people who were in his administration by their gender. He wanted the best, male or female. There's no greater evidence that Mitt Romney will represent all Americans than his record of treating all people fairly and impartially. His was a brand of leadership that got things done by bringing people together, not dividing them. We need that kind of leadership today. People are hurting in this country, and women especially have been suffering. The numbers are stark. Five-and-a-half million women are unemployed. Under President Obama, the number of women living in poverty has climbed to a record high of nearly twenty-six million. Despite President Obama's best efforts -- and despite his soaring rhetoric -- his policies simply haven't worked. In the two debates we have seen so far, we've heard the President give excuses for his disappointments, but we haven't heard him offer a specific plan or concrete proposals detailing how the next four years will be any different than the last four years. We can't afford four more years of the status quo. What we need is change, and that is precisely what Governor Romney is offering. He has a plan that will create twelve million new jobs, one that will get our economy moving again and lift Americans back out of poverty. He'll do it by offering strong leadership and by working across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats.</Msg><Username>the_whizinator</Username><Timestamp>1350512035637</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:13:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350513355158-37</Id><Topic><Title>Women favor Romney</Title><Username>the_whizinator</Username><Timestamp>1350512035637</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:13:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as the women don't have a uterus, then Romney is your man!</Msg><Username>gar4one</Username><Timestamp>1350513355158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:35:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350513639938-38</Id><Topic><Title>Women favor Romney</Title><Username>the_whizinator</Username><Timestamp>1350512035637</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:13:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' and they brought us whole binders full of women," he said. In fact, Romney did not direct women's groups to bring him female candidates, Boston Phoenix reporter David Bernstein points out. A non-partisan collaboration of women’s groups called Massachusetts Government Appointments Project (MassGAP) was responsible for the effort in 2002, when the group's leaders realized that women held only 30 percent of the top appointed positions in the state. Romney boasted that during his term as governor, Massachusetts had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America. "Now one of the reasons I was able to get so many good women to be part of that team was because of our recruiting effort," he said. This statement, too, is misleading. While 42 percent of Romney’s appointments during his first two and a half years as governor were women, the number of women in high-level appointed positions actually declined to 27.6 percent during his full tenure as governor, according to a 2007 MassGAP study.

But at his second encounter with Obama in New York, the GOP presidential candidate — who has run a post-truth campaign from day one — outdid himself and crammed 31 myths in 41 minutes: 1) “I want to make sure we keep our Pell grant program growing. We’re also going to have our loan program, so that people are able to afford school.” Paul Ryan’s budget could cut Pell Grants for nearly 1 million college students and even Romney’s white paper on education, “A Chance for Every Child,” suggests that he “would reverse the growth in Pell Grant funding.” It says: “A Romney Administration will refocus Pell Grant dollars on the students that need them most and place the program on a responsible long-term path that avoids future funding cliffs and last-minute funding patches.” 2) “I put out a five-point plan that gets America 12 million new jobs in four years and rising take-home pay.” The Washington Post’s in-house fact checker tore Romney’s claim that he will create 12 million jobs to shreds. The Post wrote that the “‘new math’” in Romney’s plan “doesn’t add up.” In awarding the claim four Pinocchios — the most untrue possible rating, the Post expressed incredulity at the fact Romney would personally stand behind such a flawed, baseless claim. 3) “And the president’s right in terms of the additional oil production, but none of it came on federal land. As a matter of fact, oil production is down 14 percent this year on federal land, and gas production was down 9 percent.” 14 percent is a one-year number. “Overall, oil production on federal land under Obama is up from 566 million barrels in 2008 to 626 million barrels in 2011, a 10.6 percent increase.” Compared to the last three years of President Bush, there have been 241 million more barrels of oil produced from public lands in the first three years of Obama. 4) “Because the president cut in half the number of licenses and permits for drilling on federal lands, and in federal waters.” There are slightly fewer permits in 2009 and 2010, from between 8,000-9,000 permits to over 5,000, and they have not been cut by half. The oil and gas industry is sitting on 7,000 approved permits to drill, where it hasn’t begun exploring or developing. Two-thirds of “acreage leased by [oil] industry lies idle” on public lands, according to the Department of the Interior. 5) “I believe very much in our renewable capabilities; ethanol, wind, solar will be an important part of our energy mix.” Romney is actually against a one-year renewal of the wind production tax credit. The wind production tax credit has led to $14 billion of investment in 2011 and tens of thousands of American jobs. 6) “And coal, coal production is not up; coal jobs are not up.” 1,500 coal jobs have been created under Obama. 7) “And if we do that, if we do what I’m planning on doing, which is getting us energy independent, North America energy independence within eight years.” Romney would actually eliminate the fuel efficiency standards that are moving the United States towards energy independence, even though his campaign plan relies on these rules to meet his goals. 8) “I will fight to create more energy in this country, to get America energy secure. And part of that is bringing in a pipeline of oil from Canada.” Even with generous assumptions, the impact of the pipeline on oil prices is unclear and may raise prices in midwest states. After all, a lot of that refined tar sands crude will be sold on the international market. 9) “The proof of whether a [energy] strategy is working or not is what the price is that you’re paying at the pump. If you’re paying less than you paid a year or two ago, why, then, the strategy is working. But you’re paying more.” Gas prices are certainly high, but oil is a global commodity, and the president has virtually no control over them. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, Romney’s proposal to increase domestic oil production would not have much impact on volatility. 10) “And I will not — I will not under any circumstances, reduce the share that’s being paid by the highest income taxpayers. And I will not, under any circumstances increase taxes on the middle-class.” As the Tax Policy Center concluded, Romney’s plan can’t both exempt middle class families from tax cuts and remain revenue neutral. “He’s promised all these things and he can’t do them all. In order for him to cover the cost of his tax cut without adding to the deficit, he’d have to find a way to raise taxes on middle income people or people making less than $200,000 a year,” the Center found. 11) “But your rate comes down and the burden also comes down on you for one more reason, and that is every middle-income taxpayer no longer will pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains. No tax on your savings. That makes life a lot easier.” This would actually help very few Americans. Nearly three-fourths of households that make $200,000 or less annually would get literally nothing from Romney’s tax cut, due to the simple fact that most of those households have no capital gains income. To be exact, 73.9 percent of the households upon which Romney “focused” his tax cut will see zero benefit from it. 12) “A recent study has shown the people in the middle-class will see $4,000.00 per year in higher taxes as a result of the spending and borrowing of this administration.” Romney is pointing to this study from the American Enterprise Institute. It actually found that rather than raise taxes to pay down the debt, the Obama administration’s policies — those contained directly in his budget — would reduce the share of taxes that go toward servicing the debt by $1,289.89 per taxpayer in the $100,000 to $200,000 range. 13) “Fifty-four percent of America’s workers work in businesses that are taxed as individuals. So when you bring those rates down, those small businesses are able to keep more money and hire more people.” Far less than half of the people affected by the expiration of the upper income tax cuts get any of their income at all from a small businesses. And those people could very well be receiving speaking fees or book royalties, which qualify as “small business income” but don’t have a direct impact on job creation. It’s actually hard to find a small business who think that they will be hurt if the marginal tax rate on income earned above $250,000 per year is increased. 14) “I went to a number of women’s groups and said, ‘Can you help us find folks,’ and they brought us whole binders full of women. I was proud of the fact that after I staffed my Cabinet and my senior staff, that the University of New York in Albany did a survey of all 50 states, and concluded that mine had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America.” Romney did not ask women groups for candidates. Instead, prior to his election, a “bipartisan group of women in Massachusetts formed MassGAP to address the problem of few women in senior leadership positions in state government.” They “put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions, agency heads, and authorities and commissions” and presented it to Romney after he was elected. A UMass-Boston study found that “the percentage of senior-level appointed positions held by women actually declined throughout the Romney administration, from 30.0% prior to his taking office, to 29.7% in July 2004, to 27.6% near the end of his term in November 2006.” 15) “I’m going to help women in America get good work by getting a stronger economy and by supporting women in the workforce.” Romney has been uncomfortably silent on the issue of pay equity. He has refused to say whether he’d support the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that would allow women to sue for equal pay, and named four of the justices who voted to roll back equal pay in that Supreme Court decision as his models for any of his appointments to the federal bench. 16) “I’d just note that I don’t believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not. And I don’t believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care of not. Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.” But back in March, Romney expressed strong support for the so-called Blunt amendment, which that would allow employers to deny contraception coverage to women. Romney also wants to defund Planned Parenthood, where 76 percent of the patients seek low-cost birth control options. Defunding the organization would make it much harder for those women to obtain contraceptives. 17) “So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did. And — and I think it’s important to know that that was a process that was necessary to get those companies back on their feet, so they could start hiring more people. That was precisely what I recommend and ultimately what happened.” This is false. As Buisnessweek explains: Romney “opposed any use of taxpayer dollars to bail out the automakers, advice that President George W. Bush and Obama ignored. GM and Chrysler went through managed bankruptcies after Bush, at the end of his presidency, and later Obama provided federal funds.” “Without federal funds, GM and Chyrsler would not have survived. As former Bush aide Tony Fratto explained, “It wasn’t just that there wasn’t credit available; a lot of private equity had cash, they just weren’t giving it away.” 18) “He said that by now middle-income families would have a reduction in their health insurance premiums by $2,500 a year. It’s gone up by $2,500 a year.” Premiums have increased, though at a lower rate than before. And while the Affordable Care Act’s most important cost contentment strategies have yet to be implemented, the law is already lowering costs. 16 million seniors have received preventive benefits without deductibles or co-pays and are saving at least $3.9 billion on prescription drugs. Millions of young adults now have insurance coverage and are staying on their parent’s health care plan, insurers that spend too many premium dollars on administrative spending have refunded consumers, and states have successfully rejected dramatic premium increases. 19) “He keeps saying, ‘Look, I’ve created 5 million jobs.’ That’s after losing 5 million jobs. The entire record is such that the unemployment has not been reduced in this country.” Job creation is net positive since Obama took office in the middle of the worst recession since the great depression. Economists estimate that up to 3 million jobs were created by the stimulus alone. 20) “The kids of those that came here illegally, those kids, I think, should have a pathway to become a permanent resident of the United States and military service, for instance, is one way they would have that kind of pathway to become a permanent resident.” But Romney has promised to end President Obama’s deferred action directive, which saves some young undocumented immigrants from deportation, though he would not take away visas from people who had already received them. He has also promised to veto the DREAM Act. 21) “Now, when the president ran for office, he said that he’d put in place, in his first year, a piece of legislation — he’d file a bill in his first year that would reform our — our immigration system… He didn’t do it. He had a Democrat House and Democrat Senate, supermajority in both houses.” Senate Republicans repeatedly prevented Obama’s immigration reform efforts. The GOP actually blocked the DREAM Act from securing 60 votes to pass cloture, denying hundreds of thousands of young undocumented immigrants a path to legal status if they enrolled in college or joined the military. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) even said on the Senate floor that young people lobbying his office had wasted their time. 22) “Any investments I have over the last eight years have been managed by a blind trust. And I understand they do include investments outside the United States, including in — in Chinese companies.” Romney’s blind trust is not very blind, and includes investments in a company owned by Romney’s son. 23) “It was a terrorist attack and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.” Obama called the Libya incident an act of “terror” the very next day. “No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for,” he said. “Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.” 24) “Consider the distance between ourselves and — and Israel, the president said that — that he was going to put daylight between us and Israel.” The Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister, Ehud Barak, told CNN, “President Obama is doing … more than anything that I can remember in the past [in regard to our security].” 25) “The president’s policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and — and — and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes.” Obama never embarked on an “apology tour.” 26) “We, of course, don’t want to have automatic weapons, and that’s already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons.” Automatic weapons are legal in this country. 27) “The — the greatest failure we’ve had with regards to — to gun violence in some respects is what — what is known as Fast and Furious. Which was a program under this administration, and how it worked exactly I think we don’t know precisely, where thousands of automatic, and AK-47 type weapons were — were given to people that ultimately gave them to — to drug lords.” The Justice Department’s inspector general “issued a scathing critique of federal officials for their handling of the botched gun-trafficking case,” but “exonerated Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., whom many Republicans have blamed for the scandal.” 28) “What I will do as president is make sure it’s more attractive to come to America again.” Romney’s plan to move the country to a territorial tax system would let corporations do business and make profits overseas without ever being taxed on it in the U.S. This would encourage American companies to invest abroad, potentially costing the country up to 800,000 jobs. 29) “Canada’s tax rate on companies is now 15 percent. Ours is 35 percent. So if you’re starting a business, where would you rather start it? We have to be competitive if we’re going to create more jobs here.” The U.S. is raising historically low amounts of revenue from the corporate income tax, and it already has the second lowest effective corporate tax rate in the world. U.S. corporations are taxed less than their foreign rivals, and the U.S. effective corporate tax rate is low compared to other developed economies. 30) “And there’s no question but that Obamacare has been an extraordinary deterrent to enterprises of all kinds hiring people.” Under the law, only companies with more than 50 employees must provide health insurance or pay a fine — that’s just 2.6 percent of businesses. If anything, expanding health care coverage to more Americans will actually create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. 31) “He said he would have by now put forward a plan to reform Medicare and Social Security, because he pointed out they’re on the road to bankruptcy.” The possibility of Medicare going bankrupt is — and historically has been — greatly exaggerated. In fact, if no changes are made, Medicare would still be able to meet 88 percent of its obligations in 2085. Social Security is fully funded for another two decades and could pay 75 percent of its benefits thereafter. There is also an easy way to ensure the program’s long-term solvency without large changes or cuts to benefits.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350520743917</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 20:39:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350523824358-43</Id><Title>Obama said - "When I WAS President"</Title><Msg>during the debate with Romney.

Clearly, he is just totally empty when it comes to his plan for the future,” Priebus said during an appearance on Laura Ingraham’s radio show on Wednesday morning. “I just find it, it’s unbelievable that the press continues to ask these questions, ‘well, what particular deduction are we talking about?’ Well, what about a plan in general from this president? He’s got nothing.” Listen: In reality, while Romney has yet to specify how he would finance a proposal that all reputable economists claim would either add to the deficit or increase taxes on middle class, Obama has laid out detailed economic policy priorities and advocated for a jobs bill that has been scored by the Congressional Budget Office. Paul Ryan has previously refused to provide the details of the GOP ticket’s tax plan, claiming that “it would take me too long.” Prominent Romney surrogate Gov. Bob McDonnell (R-VA) called such questions “laughable.”</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350525011307</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 21:50:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350525942603-45</Id><Title>Good news from Gallup</Title><Msg>Gallup: The Unemployment Rate Is Collapsing Joe Weisenthal | Oct. 17, 2012, 11:46 AM More evidence that the official 7.8% unemployment rate is not the wild outlier people initially thought. This just in from Gallup: -------- WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. unemployment, as measured by Gallup without seasonal adjustment, is 7.3% in mid-October, down considerably from 7.9% at the end of September and at a new low since Gallup began collecting employment data in January 2010. Gallup's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 7.7%, also down from September. October's adjusted mid-month measure is also more than a percentage point lower than October 2011. image These results are based on Gallup Daily tracking surveys conducted by landline and cell phone with more than 30,000 U.S. adults from Sept. 16-Oct. 15. Gallup's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate incorporates the .04 upward adjustment used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in October of last year. The adjustment for September was an increase of .02, which explains the .04 drop in seasonally adjusted employment despite the .06 decline in the unadjusted number.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350525942603</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 22:05:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350526367968-46</Id><Topic><Title>Good news from Gallup</Title><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350525942603</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 22:05:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. builders started construction on homes in September at the fastest rate since July 2008 and made plans to build even more homes in the coming months.

From a dollars- and-cents standpoint, it’s not even close. The BGOV Barometer shows that, over the five decades since John F. Kennedy was inaugurated, $1,000 invested in a hypothetical fund that tracks the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index (SPX) only when Democrats are in the White House would have been worth $10,920 at the close of trading yesterday. Chart: Stock Investors Fare Better Under Democrats That’s more than nine times the dollar return an investor would have realized from following a similar strategy during Republican administrations. A $1,000 stake invested in a fund that followed the S&amp;P 500 under Republican presidents, starting with Richard Nixon, would have grown to $2,087 on the day George W. Bush left office. “The market does tend to do better under Democrats than under Republicans,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&amp;P Equity Research in New York, said in a telephone interview. “Is it because Republicans mishandled the economy, or inherited a weak economy? I’ll leave that to others.” Some of the difference may stem from the fact that every Republican president since at least the end of World War II has faced a recession during his first term in office, Stovall said. Nine of 11 recessions that began since 1945 -- and seven of eight since Kennedy ran for president in 1960 --started with Republicans in the Oval Office. Wall Street Republicans Democratic administrations also may be more likely to spend money on government programs that stimulate the economy, Stovall said. “I dare say that most people on Wall Street are Republicans,” Stovall said. “But it appears the bread is buttered on the Democratic side.” The S&amp;P 500 yesterday hit its highest intra-day level since June 2008 and closed at 1,362.21, the highest since last April 29. The benchmark index is up 8.3 percent so far in 2012, the biggest year-to-date gain at this point since 1991. Since Kennedy took office, the Democratic S&amp;P fund logged a 992 percent gain, versus 109 percent growth for the opposition party, even though Democrats occupied the White House for 23 years over the period, compared with 28 years of Republican presidential leadership. The annualized return for 23 years of Democratic administrations is 11 percent, or four times the 2.7 percent annualized return during 28 years of Republican presidencies. Democratic Edge Investing $1,000 in funds that mirror the Dow Jones Industrial Average under the same conditions, Democratic investors would have had $7,550, versus $2,716 under Republicans. The Democratic edge is so large that the party comes out ahead even without counting Bill Clinton (the Democrat with the biggest S&amp;P 500 gain) and George W. Bush (the Republican with the worst market record). A hypothetical $1,000 investment under Democrats excluding Clinton was worth $3,539 versus $3,296 invested under Republicans except Bush. Adding Dwight Eisenhower to the Republican column doesn’t overcome the Democratic advantage, either: $1,000 invested in the S&amp;P 500 in January 1953 would have been worth $4,796 after 36 years under Republican chief executives -- still less than half the $10,920 nest egg accumulated in 23 years under Democrats.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350530671195</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 23:24:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350531897369-49</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes Magazine says Obama did better in the second debate</Title><Username>elksmember</Username><Timestamp>1350491825746</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:37:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>biddermom, Off course you're absolutely wrong again!
