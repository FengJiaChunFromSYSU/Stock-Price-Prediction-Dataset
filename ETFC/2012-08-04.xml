The Bain attacks are “part of a strategy by Team Obama to turn Romney’s biggest perceived strength – his business experience – into his biggest weakness,” writes Fox’s Juan Williams [3]. “Romney needs to come clean or his hopes of being president will end long before Election Day.” How has Romney come so close to bungling his big chance, even before he has been nominated by his party? He appeared to be in an ideal position to turn his experience as a businessman into a winning political narrative. During these jobless economic doldrums, Romney might have become a champion of capitalism, explaining how private enterprise works and how it creates jobs. His problem is that his time at Bain is not a classic story of heroic capitalism at work. Instead of an old-school entrepreneur with a good idea who raises funds to employ Americans to make a product that sells successfully around the world, Romney took distraught companies, charged them hefty fees, fired workers, and set the stumbling enterprise off in a new direction, laden with debt. Some companies prospered, some failed. Some gave Americans new jobs, some sent jobs overseas. Romney’s tax embarrassment follows a similar arc. No one likes paying taxes, but conservatives have made tax dodging a religion, so Romney was in prime position to explain how taxing people too much can drag an economy down and how the rich, if lightly taxed, spend freely and create jobs. But the intricacies of Romney’s vast wealth are far from simple and his personal tax avoidance measures beyond ingenious. There may be good reasons to hold a bank account in a tax haven like the Caymans, but most Americans don’t have reason to resort to such ruses. They suspect that those who help avoid the payment of taxes due in America are unpatriotic, even un-American. So how does Romney set minds at rest on his tax record? He doesn’t; he insists he will only issue two tax returns.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344098307000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 12:38:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344098380000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Wimp defined</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344098307000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 12:38:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many have a visceral dislike of Romney and his kind of well-heeled Republican. He is too rich, too smooth, too handsome. His family is too large and their vacations too extravagant [4]. His privilege since birth has set him apart from ordinary Americans. His business at Bain was largely slaughterman’s work, taking unsentimental decisions about shedding jobs, incurring debt and closing plants. His private fortune is so substantial he employs armies of accountants to pick holes in the tax laws. He is prepared to say and do anything to get elected. Except for one thing: He won’t – or can’t – explain why capitalism is good. Preaching the virtues of capitalism red in tooth and claw (to paraphrase Tennyson) is a hard sell at any time. Right now, in the midst of the most prolonged recession since the Great Depression, capitalism is in the self-immolating period Joseph Schumpeter cheerily dubbed “creative destruction [5].” If you believe what’s on the label, stronger, leaner companies will emerge from the wreckage, better fitted to the new competitive marketplace. A leap of imagination is needed to grasp an argument that is so faith-based and counterintuitive. Not even Ronald Reagan, with all his persuasive eloquence, was able to convince Americans it was true: Closing companies and firing people leads to new jobs; outsourcing jobs overseas helps Americans get a job; free trade makes the whole world better off; and so on. Romney hasn’t been helped in his task by those he beat to the nomination. Rick Perry describes what Bain does as “vulture capitalism [6],” picking the flesh off the bones of corporate corpses, while New Gingrich’s dark charge [7] was that Bain was no more than “rich people figuring out clever legal ways to loot a company.” It is only a small step from such ferocious friendly fire to hostile questions [8] about exactly when Romney left Bain’s employ, which disastrous Bain deals he was involved in, and which of the Bain companies he presided over fired people and sent jobs overseas. For now, while Romney gaffes his way around the world, questions about exactly what he did in his Bain years [9] and what taxes he paid before last year will remain unanswered. But damage has been done: The impression is that Romney’s vampire capitalism and his reluctance to pay his dues are hard to explain, even indefensible. Unless he returns to America in a more transparent mood and is prepared to open a decade of tax returns to scrutiny, he will be dogged by questions all the way to Nov. 6.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344098380000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 12:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344099859000-17</Id><Topic><Title>"Papers, please"</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344093887000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 11:24:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pensions stole...or were they just given away...not many unions believe in a honest days work for a honest day pay....the not my job attitudes, not in my contract,..got a grievance in my back pocket gives me a ticket to run out at lunch time and smoke a little weed.....ignorance is not always bliss...when the results are unintended consequences....when you're dumb ..you suffer...</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1344099859000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 13:04:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344099994000-18</Id><Title>Let them eat cake</Title><Msg>You didn't eat that.

In a 630-page deposition recorded over two days in late May, Greer, who is on trial for corruption charges, unloaded a litany of charges against the “whack-a-do, right-wing crazies” in his party, including the effort to suppress the black vote. In the deposition, released to the press yesterday, Greer mentioned a December 2009 meeting with party officials. “I was upset because the political consultants and staff were talking about voter suppression and keeping blacks from voting,” he said, according to the Tampa Bay Times. He also said party officials discussed how “minority outreach programs were not fit for the Republican Party,” according to the AP.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344111274000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 16:14:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344114847000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Adam Smith and JB</Title><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1344104436000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 14:20:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Adam Smif --closet gay..

While the ad is steeped in the rhetoric of the birther movement, it goes far beyond simply claiming that Obama was not born in the United States. Indeed, the ad manages to cram a truly stunning number of far right conspiracy theories into just one minute of air time: Who is Barack Obama? We know less about this man than any other President in American history. What’s he hiding? His autobiography is full of fictional characters. But there’s a lot more than that. If you try to look into his past, you run into a brick wall. His college records at Columbia, sealed! His college records at Harvard, sealed! We don’t know what his thesis papers were about because those are sealed too. He Selective Service record is sealed. His records as an attorney are sealed. He has a Connecticut Social Security number and we can’t get answers about that either. And no one — I mean no one — has seen an actual physical copy of Barack Obama’s birth certificate. The fact is, if we don’t know who Barack Obama is, we shouldn’t even have him as a candidate for president. Let’s disqualify Obama before the Democratic National Convention. Call today to sign the demand to disqualify Obama. . . . We need 10,000 signatures from every congressional district to boot this guy off the ballot and have the Democrats nominate someone else. Watch it: The ad identifies no actual legal basis for its claim that a sitting president can be forced to give up his reelection bid if enough of his political opponents sign a petition. As the ad’s announcer reads his script, a chryon runs at the bottom asking questions such as “What is [Obama's] connection to Bill Ayers?” “What is his current relationship with Rev. Wright?” and “Who paid for his Harvard Education?” The Conservative Majority fund’s website also appears entirely devoted to promoting far right myths, including a campaign to keep the United Nations from seizing people’s guns, an attack on the Obama Administration’s supposed “deep and dirty involvement in the the Fast &amp; Furious gun-running scandal,” and multiple pages devoted to fighting the nearly non-existent problem of voter fraud. Their birther petition calling for Congress to “investigate Barack Obama’s forged birth certificate” prominently features anti-immigrant Sheriff Joe Arpaio. The Conservative Majority Fund only filed its initial papers with the Federal Elections Commission a month ago, and has not yet disclosed the extent of its spending on this ad. Their spending is significant enough, however, that the ad ran simultaneously on both CNN and Fox News this morning, and it is twice the length of a normal campaign ad.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344117592000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 17:59:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344117610000-39</Id><Title>Is Harry Reid a Serial Pederast?...</Title><Msg>Gosh, I Hope Not!... http://wizbangblog.com/2012/08/04/is-harry-reid-a-serial-pederast/</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344117610000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 18:00:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344117820000-40</Id><Topic><Title>Is Harry Reid a Serial Pederast?...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344117610000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 18:00:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Michael Jackson, Sandusky...Harry Reid????

In analysis , the company observes that since November 2008, certain groups of living residents have been far more likely to be purged from the voting roles than others. Their data suggests that beyond the wide variation in purge rates across states, there is significant variation within states: In many states, certain parts of the state electorate, both geographically and demographically, are much more likely to be dropped off of the voter rolls than others. More specifically, some general trends that we see are focused on: a. Urbanity – cities are getting disproportionately purged b. Race – minorities are getting disproportionately purged c. Marital Status – unmarried people are getting disproportionately purged d. Age – younger (&lt; 40 years old) and older (&gt; 65 years old) voters are purged more frequently than middle-aged voters e. County effects – there are big differences across county lines, pointing to sharp discontinuities based on arbitrary political boundaries that do not correspond with inherent behavioral differences Catalist notes that more than 2.7 million living people who voted in 2008 have since been purged from the voter rolls. Among those, African American voters are “1.5 times more likely to be purged than Caucasian voters, nationally.” These findings are consistent with what we have seen in Florida with Gov. Rick Scott’s (R) error-riddled purge attempts. A Miami Herald analysis showed that “Hispanic, Democratic and independent-minded voters [were] the most likely to be targeted” by that effort. Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who led the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee’s efforts in the 1960s to ensure voting rights for all Americans, said last month that these purges of eligible voters from the rolls make him “want to just cry, after people gave a little blood, after some people were beaten, shot and murdered trying to help people become registered voters.” He lamented that “states throughout the nation come along with tactics to make it hard, to make it difficult for people to participate. We should be making it easy and simple and open up the political process and let all of the people come in.” Instead, Scott and others are pushing efforts that may make it impossible for these millions of U.S. citizens to exercise their right to vote. These numbers show that regardless of whether the intent of these purges is discriminatory, their effect clearly is.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344117950000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 18:05:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344118280000-43</Id><Title>GOP assault on MEDICARE</Title><Msg>Study: Seniors Would Pay More For Medicare Under Republican-Backed Plan By Amanda Peterson Beadle on Aug 1, 2012 Lawmakers like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-WY) support radically restructuring the current the Medicare system into a voucher program that provides seniors with “premium support” credits to purchase coverage from an exchange of private health insurers or remain in traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Mitt Romney, the GOP presidential candidate, has embraced the idea, which critics have long suspected would increase costs for seniors. Under the proposal, insurance plans would submit bids for how much they would charge to provide coverage and the voucher “would be tied to the premium of the private plan with the second-lowest cost, or the premium for traditional Medicare—whichever is lower.” Critics charged that in areas where private plans make bids that are lower than the cost of traditional Medicare, seniors would see increase costs and now, a new study finds that had the plan been implemented in 2009, 24 million beneficiares enrolled in the program would have paid higher premiums to maintain their choice of plan and doctors: Nationally, in 2009, the benchmark plan under the Ryan-Wyden framework (ie, the second-lowest plan) bid an average of 9% below traditional Medicare costs (traditional Medicare was equivalent to approximately the tenth-lowest bid). Since traditional Medicare is simply another plan option under the Ryan-Wyden plan, a beneficiary in 2009 would have paid an average of $64 per month (9% of $717) in additional premiums to stay in traditional Medicare. Across the United States, 68% of traditional Medicare beneficiaries in 2009 (approximately 24 million beneficiaries) lived in counties in which traditional Medicare spending was greater than the second–least expensive plan and would have paid more to keep their choice of coverage (a share that would have been 81% in 2008, 75% in 2007, and 67% in 2006). Furthermore, more than 90% of MA beneficiaries (approximately 6.6 million seniors, excluding those dually eligible or in employer plans) would have also paid more for the plan they chose. On average, the GOP-backed idea would have resulted in a premium increase of $768 million each year for those 24 million seniors, accounting for 68 percent of beneficiaries.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1344118280000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 18:11:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344120253000-44</Id><Topic><Title>"Papers, please"</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344093887000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 11:24:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"After all, the one year’s tax returns that he has released raise doubt about his campaign’s claims that his offshore accounts did not save him one penny of tax.

GRAETZ PRESSURE is mounting for Mitt Romney to release more of his financial records. Mr. Romney has made public only his 2010 tax returns and has said his 2011 documents will be released soon. “That’s all that’s necessary for people to understand something about my finances,” he said recently. He is “simply not enthusiastic,” he also said, about giving the Obama campaign “hundreds or thousands of more pages to pick through, distort and lie about.” But it is a good bet that Mr. Romney’s vetters have picked through more than two years of returns of his vice-presidential contenders. And the Senate typically requires more for confirmation to a cabinet or even a subcabinet post. Until Mr. Romney recognizes the right of voters to understand the finances of their leaders, all we are left with is speculation. Some commentators have suggested, for example, that — like tens of thousands of other Americans who have taken advantage of an Internal Revenue Service amnesty — he might not have declared and paid taxes on his Swiss bank account. I can’t imagine that he would have engaged in such blatant tax cheating. He is far too smart for that. Another suggestion is that in 2009 he paid income taxes significantly below the 13.9 percent he paid in 2010. This is more plausible, and potentially more damaging politically, even if perfectly legal. After all, the one year’s tax returns that he has released raise doubt about his campaign’s claims that his offshore accounts did not save him one penny of tax. Putting business assets into an individual retirement account invested in a Cayman Islands corporation allows Mr. Romney to avoid the “unrelated business income tax” — a 35 percent levy — on at least some of his I.R.A.’s earnings, a tax that he would have had to pay if his I.R.A. were held directly by a financial institution in the United States. With an I.R.A. account of $20 million to $101 million, the tax savings would be more than a few pennies. The I.R.A. also allows Mr. Romney to diversify his large holdings tax-free, avoiding the 15 percent tax on capital gains that would otherwise apply. His financial disclosure further reveals that his I.R.A. freed him from paying currently the 35 percent income tax on hundreds of thousands of dollars of interest income each year. Given the extraordinary size of his I.R.A., we have to presume that Mr. Romney valued the assets he put in his retirement account at far less than he would have sold them for. Otherwise it is quite a trick to turn contributions that are limited to $30,000 to $50,000 a year into the $20 million to $101 million he now has there. But we cannot be certain; his meager disclosure of tax records and financial information does not indicate what kind of assets were put into the I.R.A. Mr. Romney’s Cayman Islands and Bermuda corporations also probably allowed him to avoid limitations on deductions for investment expenditures that would otherwise apply. So we don’t need any more tax returns to know that Mr. Romney is an Olympic-level athlete at the tax avoidance game. Rich people don’t send their money to Bermuda or the Cayman Islands for the weather.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344123115000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 19:31:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344123763000-52</Id><Topic><Title>Which Commie Pinkos should live ...find out who...</Title><Username>legofthebear</Username><Timestamp>1344121715000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 19:08:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yew live in Boca Raton don't yew...</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1344123763000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 19:42:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344124061000-53</Id><Topic><Title>"Papers, please"</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344093887000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 11:24:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/opinion/the-mysteries-of-mitt-romneys-financial-records.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=print</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1344124061000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 19:47:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344126803000-54</Id><Title>JB Found With Gerbils in Her A$_$?...</Title><Msg>Oh MY Gosh Golly Gee!!!...

Obama borrowed $825 Billion from China and future US taxpayers to fund a stimulus program that has failed on the very criteria he established to measure its success. One major flop was Solyndra, a misadventure that is particularly offensive for its cronyism, lawlessness, waste, and eventual pitiful attempts at blame shift.

The DNC nullified the military vote in Florida during the Bush Bore election, and now they're trying to do it in Ohio for the Romney/Obama campaign. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/04/obama-campaign-sues-ohio-over-early-voting-law-for-military/ You see, last time they complained that the postmarks were dated too late, never mind that they weren't even applied since military mail for deployed personnel is free and sent to APO's where marks are applied LATER. No, they had all those nasty military votes thrown out then, and they're trying it now. Any particular reason why they'd do this? Well, perhaps its because military personnel are far more informed about the capabilities of their commander and chief than are normal people, and thus tend to vote about 2:1 in favor of Republicans. Of course not the Democrats say, out the other side of their lying heads. Why you'd think they'd be grateful for being pulled out of those nasty combat zones, yet THIS election the military is polling 4:5 against Obama. With even 24% of the military African American vote going to Romney. Something tells me that they think Obama screwed up big somewhere along the line.

Sometimes it's "I helped start Staples" while other times it is "I started Staples" or even "I started Staples, for gosh sakes." On occasion it's the more modest "When I was at Bain, we helped start Staples." The reality is that Romney didn't start Staples at all. He thought Staples was a bad idea. He even tried to prevent Bain from investing in the company. Here's the truth: Two men named Leo Kahn and Thomas Stemberg started Staples. As they grew their business, Stemberg approached Bessemer Venture Partners, a competitor of Romney's Bain. Stemberg wanted to borrow money from Bessemer to open more Staples stores. Bessemer then approached Bain about joining in the venture to spread the risk. But Romney didn't like the idea at all. He thought Staples was a bad investment and turned Bessemer down. Not once, not twice, but three times. Only after other people at Bain pushed did Romney reluctantly reconsider. He still expressed strong opposition to the deal, but would not stand in the way of providing some backing. The proposed investment in Staples was tiny compared to other Bain deals. Bain then made a modest $650,000 investment in Staples. Because he headed Bain, Romney was offered a seat on the Staples board. While on the board, Romney had no direct involvement in the company nor any management control. He simply showed up at a board meeting every few months. He was absent from meetings more times than he was present. Bain made additional modest investments in Staples, for a total of $2.5 million. As soon as the company went public, Romney dumped Bain's share and was out of the investment. When Bain got rid of its stake, Staples was still a small chain, with only 24 stores in New England and barely a thousand part-time jobs. It was nowhere near the mega-giant it would become. With time, Staples grew to more than 2,200 stores with 89,000 employees. All of that growth occured long after Romney had left Bain and long after he had any connection whatsoever with the company. A company Romney thought was a bad investment. Which he demonstrated by pulling out as quickly as he could. What's troubling most about this is how the lie "Romney started Staples" is endlessly repeated by his supporters and even some of his opponents. Romney no more started Staples than he started Apple or Microsoft. He made a small investment in the company, pulled out early and that's it. His investment was barely anything more than buying stock in the company. Romney's claim that he started Staples is no more valid than an investor who bought Apple stock in 1990 claiming, "I started Apple."

They just assume their viewers are "slow" and you never disappoint. Fox News falsely implies Obama curtailing military voting in Ohio Source: Raw Story Fox News falsely implies Obama curtailing military voting in Ohio By Jonathan Terbush Saturday, August 4, 2012 17:47 EDT A Fox News report Friday night suggested that the Democratic National Committee and President Obama’s campaign were suing to strip voting privileges from members of the military and their families in Ohio, even though the lawsuit in no way cuts back on that group’s voting rights. “If President Obama gets his way, the special voting rights of some of America’s finest will be eliminated,” host Shannon Bream said. “The campaign is suing to keep members of the military from having extra time to cast their ballots in one key battlegound state.” In actuality, the complaint filed by the Obama campaign would reinstate special voting rights that, until recently, extended to all Ohioans and not just those serving in the armed forces. The issue stems from the Republican-controlled legislature’s decision late last year to alter early voting procedures. In the past, all voters could cast ballots in the days immediately prior to the election. But under the new law, only members of the military would be allowed to vote through the Monday immediately before the election, while early voting for non-military citizens would end the previous Friday.

Anything to distract from his tax problems. Today Mitt Romney posted this to his Facebook page: President Obama’s lawsuit claiming it is unconstitutional for Ohio to allow servicemen and women extended early voting privileges during the state’s early voting period is an outrage. The brave men and women of our military make tremendous sacrifices to protect and defend our freedoms, and we should do everything we can to protect their fundamental right to vote. I stand with the fifteen military groups that are defending the rights of military voters, and if I’m entrusted to be the commander-in-chief, I’ll work to protect the voting rights of our military, not undermine them. Of course, the Obama for America lawsuit does nothing of the kind. As Think Progress points out, the lawsuit only seeks to restore voting rights to civilians. From the complaint: Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to restore in-person early voting for all Ohioans during the three days prior to Election Day – a right exercised by an estimated 93,000 Ohioans in the last presidential election. Ohio election law, as currently enacted by the State of Ohio and administered by Defendant Ohio Secretary of State, arbitrarily eliminates early voting during the three days prior to Election Day for most Ohio voters, a right previously available to all Ohio voters. Think Progress notes: Even Fox News acknowledges the purpose of the suit, noting “the lawsuit does not restrict the ability of military personnel to cast their ballots early.” But apparently this fact "escapes" the Romney team. Eric Fehrnstrom should really take a look in the mirror and contemplate how far gone one is when Fox News won't even parrot your lies? It will be so much more easy for Mitt Romney to beat the imaginary Barack Obama he's created than the one that has been president the last three and half years.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344136912000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 23:21:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
