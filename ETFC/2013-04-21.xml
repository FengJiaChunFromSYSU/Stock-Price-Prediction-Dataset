For millennia the value of a human life was measured in what it could produce versus what it cost to feed it, and in most cases, little more. To insist that a woman carry a fetus to term just because its a potential life is to criminalize masturbation as mass murder.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1366530008047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 03:40:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366530813249-2</Id><Topic><Title>Chechen Islamist brothers were the Boston bombers</Title><Username>croxcost</Username><Timestamp>1366374616708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 08:30:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why not every single convicted killer goes to death row? Because people who have brains can distinguish between one murder case and another. Motives, severity, and all other kinds of details do make a huge difference. Did you see patriotic celebrations on the streets of Boston after 2nd Chechen was apprehended? Saw Red Socks or Bruins fans singing national anthem? Things like that donâ€™t happen after murders in abortion clinics. Now, go ahead and tell why.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1366530813249</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 03:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366531600330-3</Id><Topic><Title>Chechen Islamist brothers were the Boston bombers</Title><Username>croxcost</Username><Timestamp>1366374616708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 08:30:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reality is that 2 jihadists blew up couple of bombs in Boston, not those "clinging to their guns and religion".

Totally CORRECT! They are to DOPED up to be scared like at the POT RALLY in Denver! And they need more freedom to make/echange their cooking classes of hashish and #$%$! And on top of that one doper brings a gun and shoots 3 people - nice going in the state/town with the newest, toughest gun laws!!! The good thing is - that they won't have to be SCARED about a terrorist because they want us to become a nation of DOPES!!! Why don't the DOPERS hold classes on how to convert to JIHAD, while they are at it - maybe next time??? (For a main event STONE a few STONED women!)

Woman's right to choose is artificially made up, wide spread, recent concept. Impregnated woman usually carried her fetus up till birth for thousands of years. In fact, for centuries religious view on abortion was as sinful act, and most countries in the world came through theocracy, or later largely influenced and driven by basic religious concepts. Infanticide used to be the worst form of abortion, and even punished. You can argue that "simple humanity" is a recent concept. But it doesn't change the fact that abortions were never welcomed in the old past. My last point was that defining pro-choice as "universally accepted" is softly speaking overstatement. To the original point of abortion clinic shooting defined as terrorism. We know as much today about development of the fetus in mother's womb to come to conclusion that unborn on fairly early phase of development is not just a thing at women's personal disposal. In the minds of millions it is already a human. Defending the life of a human is Christian concept, some people chose creepy ways to do that. I would argue in some cases mental instability is the factor. But I disagree, abortion clinic killers don't do that for the sake of simply making a statement. That's a whole a world of difference with terrorism.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1366563415985</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-21 12:56:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366583090878-12</Id><Topic><Title>Was Mccain a terrorist?
