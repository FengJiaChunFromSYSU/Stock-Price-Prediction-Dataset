They are trimming expenses, repairing balance sheet by rolling over expensive debt into more reasonable rates.

JEF deal was done at such a low premium because management gets to keep their job at the new outfit.

Nobody bothered to find out which Hollywood starlet or golf course Obama was on, and let him know. Rep.

Reichert told House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.), who put Kelley in touch with FBI Director Robert Mueller.
