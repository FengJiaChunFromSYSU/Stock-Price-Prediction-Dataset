Or more accurately, a series of problems. After all, the same man who five years ago said that "it's not worth moving heaven and earth" to get Osama Bin Laden forgot to mention America's war in Afghanistan and the men and women still fighting it during his RNC acceptance speech last week. Worse still, Romney slammed Republican leaders--including his own running mate Paul Ryan--for voting for the August 2011 debt ceiling deal that is set to sequester $550 billion from the defense budget over the next decade. But not to content to rest there, CEO turned Commander-in-Chief Mitt Romney would spend money like a drunken sailor, adding $2 trillion in new Pentagon outlays without either a strategy to justify it or funding to pay for it. Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press with David Gregory, Governor Romney said the debt deal that Ryan and House Speaker John Boehner struck with President Obama was a "big mistake." (As you may recall, Romney was mocked by Democrats and Sarah Palin alike for his silence during last year's debt ceiling hostage crisis, only to weigh in after a deal was struck to announce he was opposed to the agreement which prevented the United States from default.) On Sunday, he explained why: "I want to maintain defense spending at the current level of the GDP. I don't want to keep bringing it down as the president's doing. This sequestration idea of the White House, which is cutting our defense, I think is an extraordinary miscalculation in the wrong direction." Of course, as a quick glance at the numbers shows, it is Mitt Romney who is making an extraordinary miscalculation when it comes to defense spending. Romney is proposing to do for the Pentagon what spreadsheet users like him call "fill right." By setting defense spending as fixed percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), the DoD budget would fall and rise along with the economy. The result is a golden shower for the military that would make Ronald Reagan look like Mahatma Gandhi. Whether or not the United States is at war or peace, or as it is now, drawing down from a conflict, the implications of Romney's 4 percent "floor" are mind-boggling. CNN noted in its analysis that the price tag could reach $2.1 trillion over the next decade. As the Boston Globe detailed in March: The cost appears to be far greater than when Romney first broached the idea several years ago, when the nation was spending closer to 4 percent of GDP on defense. Under next year's budget, defense spending is projected to be about 3.2 percent - yet Romney has stuck by his 4 percent vow. Put another way, that means Romney proposes spending 61 percent more than Obama at the end of a decade-long cycle, according to the libertarian Cato Institute. Enacting such an increase at the same time that Romney wants to slash taxes and balance the budget could cost trillions of dollars and require huge cuts in domestic programs. As Romney's website puts it matter-of-factly, "This will not be a cost-free process." That's right. By 2021, even a peacetime Romney defense budget would approach $900 billion a year. That open spigot would come despite the fact that baseline U.S. defense spending (that is, outside of "overseas contingency operations" war funding for Iraq and Afghanistan) has risen during every year of the Obama administration so far. And as even his boosters like James Jay Carafano of the Heritage Foundation admit, "If you look at the state of our industrial base, you couldn't spend 4 percent on the military if you wanted to. People couldn't build the ships and planes fast enough." Regardless of whether we needed them or not. Of course, even if he could articulate the national security threat and needed strategic response justifying his massive military build-up, Mitt Romney has remained silent on how he would pay for it. Recall that George W. Bush became the first modern president to cut taxes during wartime. By 2020, the total costs to the U.S. Treasury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, including international development, health care and interest on the national debt, could reach $ 3 trillion. (Recall also that last year, Mitt Romney and all of his GOP primary rivals rejected even a 10-to-1 ratio of spending cuts to tax increases by the "Debt Super Committee" as a means of avoiding sequestration.) And while that tab remains unpaid, President Romney would double-down by making the Bush tax cuts permanent and slashing an additional 20 percent across the board. To that $5 trillion revenue hole, Romney would add over $2 trillion more in new defense spending. Because his plans to close tax loopholes are as secret as his own tax returns, the inevitable result will be draconian cuts in domestic programs and an ocean of red ink. And that's a big problem for CEO Mitt Romney, the man who would be our next Commander-in-Chief."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347250378269</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 00:12:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347287178174-2</Id><Topic><Title>a republican women speaks up on women and democracy</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1347219979200</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 15:46:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just pointing out how anti democracy and anti women the gop is.

Bush by Peter Beinart Sep 10, 2012 1:00 AM EDT Why Dubya will decide the winner this fall. Print Email Comments (1609) The conventions are over, but the individual who will determine the 2012 election didn’t attend either of them. His name is George W. Bush. Tigers Rangers Baseball LM Otero / AP Conventional wisdom holds that elections are about the future. Or about the personalities of the candidates. Or at least about voters’ perceptions of the last four years. But a quick glance at history shows that’s not always so. Republicans won every election between 1868 and 1880—not because Ulysses S. Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes, and James Garfield were such fabulous candidates, and not because their Democratic opponents were so awful. Nor did they win because of the conditions in the country at the time. They won because when Americans thought about the Republican Party, they thought about Abraham Lincoln. And when they thought about the Democrats, they thought about Jefferson Davis. The same thing happened after the New Deal. In 1948, Harry Truman was personally unpopular and Americans were in a foul mood. But Truman won in large measure because of the way Americans felt about the Democratic and Republican parties, impressions created less by him or his GOP opponent, Thomas Dewey, than by two guys named Roosevelt and Hoover, who had faced off in 1932. The same was true in 1988, when George H.W. Bush, a weak candidate in his own right, made his race versus Michael Dukakis another referendum on Ronald Reagan versus Jimmy Carter. The point, as Walter Dean Burnham and other political scientists have noted, is that not all presidential elections are created equal. Some create a realignment—a shift in public perception of the two parties—that then frames the elections after that. In this era, Bill Clinton began that realignment by ameliorating the Democrats’ reputation as fiscally irresponsible and soft on national security, welfare, and crime. By Clinton’s second term, when asked which party they felt more favorable toward, Americans gave Democrats a double-digit advantage. Then George W. Bush was elected, presided over catastrophes in Iraq, the financial system, and the Gulf Coast—and the GOP’s public image nosedived. Democrats haven’t maintained all the good will they racked up in the Clinton era, which isn’t surprising given the lousy state of the economy. But neither have Republicans rebounded much from their Bush-era collapse. And the result is a Democratic advantage, especially among rising demographic groups like Hispanics and the young. Mitt Romney is not a great candidate; Barack Obama is a better one. But without the Bush legacy, Romney would be leading this race. His problem is that except among staunch conservatives, Bush has so hurt the GOP’s brand that Romney doesn’t look like the fresh economic fix-it man that Republicans want to portray him as. Instead, it’s all too easy for Democrats to paint him as George W. Bush the 3rd, just as they painted John McCain as George W. Bush the 2nd. Romney has tried to handle the Bush legacy the same way McCain did: by ignoring it. When Republicans convened in late August in Tampa, as in Minneapolis in 2008, Bush was not there. But in campaigns, ignoring your weaknesses rarely makes them go away. While at their convention Republicans tried to pretend that the Bush presidency never happened, the Obama campaign handed Bill Clinton the microphone and allowed him to define the race as Obama-Clinton versus Romney-Bush. The GOP, in Clinton’s narrative, creates economic messes. Democrats clean them up. Historically, the candidates who win when their parties are unpopular are those able to create strong, distinct personal brands. Eisenhower wasn’t just some generic Republican. He was the general who liberated Europe. And he couldn’t be painted as Hoover redux because he basically embraced the New Deal. In 1992 Clinton ran as a New Democrat (i.e., not Jimmy Carter) who rejected his own party’s dogmas on crime, welfare, and foreign policy. George W. Bush was MIA at the RNC, but his brother, Jeb Bush, spoke. Romney’s problem is that like Dewey in 1948 or Dukakis in 1988, his personal brand is weak. To win the primaries and gin up core conservative support, he has amputated those parts of his political persona that might have allowed him to come across as something other than a generic Republican. And unfortunately for him, when Americans think of a generic Republican today, they still think of George W. Bush. One day, a Republican presidential candidate will exorcise Bush’s ghost. But most likely, he or she will do so by bluntly telling Americans where Bush’s presidency went wrong, and how their presidency will be different. Until that happens, George W. Bush will be present at every Republican and Democratic convention for years to come, whether anyone invites him or not.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347291727753</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 11:42:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347293612643-4</Id><Title>Lyin' Ryan dancing around his record</Title><Msg>"CBS News' Norah O'Donnell put Paul Ryan's feet to the fire for criticizing President Obama for defense spending cuts after he supported them himself. Mitt Romney's "Meet the Press" appearance put the cuts back in the spotlight on Sunday. The candidate said that Republicans made a "mistake" when they agreed to a debt ceiling deal that would decrease defense spending by $500 billion over the next ten years. O'Donnell did not give Ryan on an easy pass on the issue. "He's talking about you because you voted for those cuts, correct?" she asked him. Ryan said that he voted for the cuts because he was trying to find "common ground" with the Democrats to reduce the budget deficit. He added that he wrote a bill that would have reduced spending elsewhere and prevented "the president’s irresponsible, devastating defense cuts." O'Donnell continued to press Ryan, saying that the defense cuts were part of the Budget Control Act and that he supported the act. She went a step further and quoted him calling the legislation a "victory" and a "positive step forward." "So, you voted for defense cuts, and now you’re criticizing the president for those same defense cuts that you voted for and called a victory," O'Donnell said. "The goal was never that these defense cuts actually occur," Ryan responded. He said that he supported a sequestration measure, which would have triggered automatic cuts if the supercommittee did not reach a deal. O'Donnell said that the act also contained $1 trillion in immediate cuts, including the defense cuts. "And you also voted for those, and now you're saying you didn't vote for them?" she asked. He said that the Obama administration proposed $478 billion in defense cuts, in addition to cutting about $500 billion in defense from the sequestration. "Right. A trillion dollars in defense spending, and you voted for it!" O'Donnell shot back. "No, Norah. I voted for the Budget Control Act." "That included defense spending!"</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347293612643</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 12:13:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347295017679-5</Id><Topic><Title>Lyin' Ryan dancing around his record</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347293612643</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 12:13:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ah - facts again?? - our local neo-con heads will burst into flames.</Msg><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1347295017679</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 12:36:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347295327933-6</Id><Topic><Title>I'm still looking for ROWDYRODENT</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1347211019894</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 13:16:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rowdy is probably on a cash smuggling run again.

"Chicago teachers have the highest average salary of any city at $76,000 a year before benefits. The average family in the city only earns $47,000 a year" Chicago Bled Dry by Striking Teachers’ Unions The coverage of the strike has obscured some basic facts. The money has continued to pour into Chicago’s failing public schools in recent years. Chicago teachers have the highest average salary of any city at $76,000 a year before benefits. The average family in the city only earns $47,000 a year. Yet the teachers rejected a 16 percent salary increase over four years at a time when most families are not getting any raises or are looking for work. The city is being bled dry by the exorbitant benefits packages negotiated by previous elected officials. Teachers pay only 3 percent of their health-care costs and out of every new dollar set aside for public education in Illinois in the last five years, a full 71 cents has gone to teacher retirement costs. But beyond the dollars, the fact is that Chicago schools need a fundamental shakeup — which of course the union is resisting. It is calling for changes in the teacher-evaluation system it just negotiated by making student performance less important. Small wonder.

So long as Mitt refuses to disclose his tax returns, speculation will only continue. Whatever it is, it's worse than the speculation. It's a potential campaign killer. Here is one possible reason, and it is certainly a realistic possibility for the 2009 Tax Year return: Deadline looms for Americans to disclose accounts in foreign tax havens. Oct. 13, 2009 Wealthy U.S. taxpayers, concerned about an Internal Revenue Service crackdown on the use of secret overseas bank accounts as tax havens, are rushing to meet a Thursday deadline to disclose those accounts or face possible criminal prosecution. The concern was triggered this summer when Switzerland's largest bank, caught up in an international tax evasion dispute, said it would disclose the names of more than 4,000 of its U.S. account holders. The decision shattered a long-held belief that Swiss banks would guard the identities of its American customers as carefully as they did their money, and it raised concern that other international tax havens might be next. Under an amnesty program, the IRS is allowing taxpayers to avoid prosecution for having failed to report their overseas accounts. As a result, tax attorneys across the nation have been besieged by wealthy clients who are lining up to apply even though they will still face big financial penalties. LA Times, Oct. 13, 2009: Deadline looms for Americans to disclose accounts in foreign tax havens Mathew Yglesias wonders if Romney had an illegal account for which he took advantage of the amnesty. Romney might well have thought in 2007 and 2008 that there was nothing to fear about a non-disclosed offshore account he'd set up years earlier precisely because it wasn't disclosed. But then came the settlement and the rush of non-disclosers to apply for the amnesty. Failing to apply for the amnesty and then getting charged by the IRS would have been both financially and politically disastrous. So amnesty it was. But even though the amnesty would eliminate any legal or financial liability for past acts, it would hardly eliminate political liability. Slate, Matthew Yglesias: Did Mitt Romney Take the 2009 Swiss Bank Account Amnesty Mitt likes those overseas accounts. Cayman Islands, Switzerland, etc. Do you think he would have resisted getting a non-disclosed one in Switzerland? Hell, that is a luxury good that says you've made it in his social set. He knew the Swiss would never disclose it, until they were forced to do so and the IRS came up with the amnesty. Had to take it or be publicly branded a criminal. He was running for President even back then. As Yglesias says: But even though the amnesty would eliminate any legal or financial liability for past acts, it would hardly eliminate political liability. That would be worth stonewalling forever. A real possibility as to why he won't release the return for the 2009 Tax Year. If there's smoke .... Will the tradmedia ask Romney? Update I: The evidence grows: Although Romney's campaign declined to comment for this article, in January, Brad Malt, the manager of Ann Romney's blind trust, told reporters the Romneys had an account with Swiss bank UBS worth about $3 million, which generated roughly $1,700 in interest. Malt said the account was set up for "diversification" in 2003 -- a claim that puzzles tax and investment experts, who note that all of the investment options available in Switzerland are available in American accounts. Malt said the account was closed in 2010. snip That Romney's disclosed account was with Swiss bank UBS has also raised eyebrows. In 2008, a whistleblower at the bank informed the IRS of thousands of accounts being operated by American clients to avoid paying U.S. taxes. For Americans, the coveted Swiss secrecy suddenly became a legal liability. So much information was turned over to the IRS that it would have been extremely difficult for the agency to pursue cases against every offender. So the IRS established a special tax amnesty program, which allowed those who voluntarily turned themselves in to remain anonymous and pay limited penalties. Thousands of citizens have since come forward. "It's unclear why he would have valued the Swiss bank account secrecy, and it wouldn't have enabled him legally to avoid U.S. tax," said Daniel Shaviro, a tax professor at New York University School of Law.

Organizers of the gala, which would have featured Boone alongside Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and some of the nation’s other prominent conspiracy theorists, broke the news online Friday that it was canceled “due to inadequate ticket sales.” The Sept. 22 event was meant to bring together people from throughout the nation who believe Barack Obama’s birth certificate is fake and therefore he is ineligible to be president. Organizers planned to use it to call on Congress to take up Arpaio’s yearlong investigation into the documents. The announcement was disappointing to the few people who did plan to attend, as evidenced by a handful of web postings about the cancellation. It didn’t take long for true believers to spin elaborate conspiracy theories about why the event was called off. One theory could be found on the Facebook page of Linda Bentley, an Arizona tea party activist who had been promoting the event. A visitor to her page wrote that it had been doomed because Arpaio was unwilling to take his probe even further and investigate the president for murder.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347324578160</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 20:49:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347326201740-21</Id><Topic><Title>GOP brain damage</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347320043543</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 19:34:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"George W.

(AP Photo/Hani Mohammed) SANAA, Yemen — An airstrike killed al-Qaida's No. 2 leader in Yemen along with six others traveling with him in one car on Monday, U.S. and Yemeni officials said, a major breakthrough for U.S.-backed efforts to cripple the group in the impoverished Arab nation. Saeed al-Shihri, a Saudi national who fought in Afghanistan and spent six years in the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, was killed by a missile after leaving a house in the southern province of Hadramawt, according to Yemeni military officials. They said the missile was believed to have been fired by a U.S.-operated, unmanned drone aircraft. Two senior U.S. officials confirmed al-Shihri's death but could not confirm any U.S. involvement in the airstrike. The U.S. doesn't usually comment on such attacks although it has used drones in the past to go after al-Qaida members in Yemen, which is considered a crucial battleground with the terror network. Yemeni military officials said that a local forensics team had identified al-Shihri's body with the help of U.S. forensics experts on the ground. The U.S. and Yemeni military officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to release the information to the media. Late Monday, after speculation surfaced that the attack was carried by a U.S. drone, Yemen's Defense Ministry issued a statement saying al-Shihri and six companions were killed during an operation by Yemeni armed forces in Wadi Hadramawt, but it did not elaborate on how they were killed. Yemeni military officials said they had believed the United States was behind the operation because their own army does not the capacity to carry out precise aerial attacks and because Yemeni intelligence gathering capabilities on al-Shihri's movements were limited. A brief Defense Ministry statement sent to Yemeni reporters on their mobile phones earlier in the day only said that an attack had targeted the militants. It did not specify who carried out the attack or when it took place. Al-Shihri's death is a major blow to al-Qaida's Yemen branch, which is seen as the world's most active, planning and carrying out attacks against targets on and outside U.S. territory. The nation sits on the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula and is on the doorstep of Saudi Arabia and fellow oil-producing nations of the Gulf and lies on strategic sea routes leading to the Suez Canal. The group formally known as Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula took advantage of the political vacuum during unrest inspired by the Arab Spring last year to take control of large swaths of land in the south. But the Yemeni military has launched a broad U.S.-backed offensive and driven the militants from several towns. After leaving Guantanamo in 2007, al-Shihri, who is believed to be in his late 30s, went through Saudi Arabia's famous "rehabilitation" institutes, an indoctrination program that is designed to replace what authorities in Saudi Arabia see as militant ideology with religious moderation. But he headed south to Yemen upon release and became deputy to Nasser al-Wahishi, the leader of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula. Al-Wahishi is a Yemeni who once served as Osama bin Laden's personal aide in Afghanistan. Al-Qaida in Yemen has been linked to several attempted attacks on U.S. targets, including the foiled Christmas Day 2009 bombing of an airliner over Detroit and explosives-laden parcels intercepted aboard cargo flights last year. Last year, a high-profile U.S. drone strike killed U.S.-born Anwar al-Awlaki, who had been linked to the planning and execution of several attacks targeting U.S. and Western interests, including the attempt to down a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009 and the plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010. Unlike other al-Qaida branches, the network's militants in Yemen have gone beyond the concept of planting sleeper cells and actively sought to gain a territorial foothold in lawless areas, mainly in the south of Yemen, before they were pushed back by U.S.-backed Yemeni government forces after months of intermittent battles. The fighting has killed hundreds of Yemeni soldiers. The Yemen-based militants have struck Western targets in the area twice in the past 12 years. In 2000, they bombed the USS Cole destroyer in Aden harbor, killing 17 sailors. Two years later, they struck a French oil tanker, also off Yemen. U.S. drone strikes have intensified in Yemen in recent months, killing several key al-Qaida operatives, including Samir Khan, an al-Qaida propagandist who was killed in a drone strike last year.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347327569525</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 21:39:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347327679060-23</Id><Topic><Title>GOP brain damage</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347320043543</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 19:34:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why can't you liberals ever stay on topic.
