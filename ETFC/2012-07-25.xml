Albright was one of the Olympic torch carriers. From the book: This episode is worth recounting because every prospective torch carrier was given, courtesy of the U.S. Olympic Committee, a special uniform consisting of a nylon sports jacket and matching pants. When my uniform arrived, I glanced at the label, which read “Made in Myanmar,” that is, Burma, a country that suffers under one of the most repressive governments on Earth. It was not yet illegal to import clothing from Burma, but public pressure had induced most U.S. retailers to stop doing business there. I had my own grounds for revulsion, having visited the country to pledge support for its courageous democratic leader, the Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. I was furious about the uniform but knew it was too late to reorder all the clothing, though I did go out and buy my own shirt and pants (Made in America). When I arrived in Salt Lake City, I informed Mitt Romney, head of the U.S. Olympic Committee, about the gaffe; he thanked me kindly for keeping my mouth shut. The following year, Congress approved a ban on all imports from Burma. The episode eventually became a public scandal. I emailed an Albright spokewoman to see if she would elaborate on what Romney said to her at the time, but she declined, A Romney spokeswoman didn't respond to emails for comment.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343189164000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 00:06:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343191650000-2</Id><Topic><Title>GOP WILL raise taxes</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343166626000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 17:50:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pubs WILL raise your taxes.

The Romney campaign has steadily given up on racist dog-whistles in its attacks on Barack Obama and gone for the megaphone instead. The whole effort to depict the president as "other" didn't start with Mitt Romney, of course. That began while Obama was on the campaign trail in 2007. It's all of a part with birtherism and other attacks that have their snouts firmly stuck in a racist view of the president. Lately, it can be found in comments like "His course is extraordinarily foreign." As in not American. UnAmerican. Just a step away from anti-American. On the eve of the Republican nominee's visit to England, we get something a bit more direct from The Telegraph: “We are part of an Anglo-Saxon heritage, and he feels that the special relationship is special,” the adviser said of Mr Romney, adding: “The White House didn’t fully appreciate the shared history we have”. [...] The adviser also said that Romney is “better placed to understand the depth of ties" between the two countries than Obama. That spells it out plainly. That anti-colonial Kenyan in the White House is a black man who could never understand real Americans. Idiotically racist. Boldly, brazenly racist. Ian Reifowitz has pointed out the very different, inclusive approach of the President: Barack Obama has long spoken of our national identity in terms that include Americans of every religious tradition, region, ethnic background, and sexual orientation in what he has repeatedly called the “American family.” The president has focused specifically on invigorating national bonds that unify Americans across ethnic lines. Even in his most populist recent speeches about the need for higher taxes on the wealthy, Obama has never even hinted that they are somehow “not American.” Obama's failure to do so is, of course, more evidence in the minds of the right that he is not American. Romney's adviser's comment and Romney's own comments about "foreign" ought to be enough to trigger the gag reflex of real Americans. See how that works, Mr. Romney?</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343230765000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:39:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343231315000-32</Id><Title>SCHW is gonna get ETFC for CHEAP</Title><Msg>They can now offer a one for one stock to purchase ETFC.

Sort of like telling a child not to play with fire, they don't really listen until they get burned...... Well, for your viewing pleasure, here is the story from one year ago - almost to the day. Citadel Requests Meeting, Says E*Trade ‘Failed’ in Response By Whitney Kisling - Jul 25, 2011 Citadel LLC, the biggest shareholder of E*Trade Financial Corp., said the online brokerage’s decision to hire Morgan Stanley isn’t sufficient in addressing plans for a strategic review and called again for a special meeting. E*Trade’s plan to have Morgan Stanley report to the board’s Finance and Risk Oversight Committee is “manifestly inappropriate” because most members are part of the company management or legacy directors, who “have failed” shareholders in the past, according to a July 22 regulatory filing received today. Ken Griffin’s Chicago-based hedge fund is also calling for two directors, Michael Parks and Donna Weaver, to be removed. “Once again, E*Trade’s board has failed to act in shareholders’ best interests,” Citadel wrote in a letter to the brokerage today. “Your response to our July 20 letter further demonstrates the board’s entrenchment and the lengths to which members of the board will go to maintain the status quo to the detriment of shareholders.” In a letter last week, Citadel called on the company to perform a review of strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company. The online brokerage, whose shares have fallen 94 percent in four years, responded to its request to address those “catastrophic losses” by deciding to retain Morgan Stanley, after saying that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. completed a strategic review in 2010. The company, which has counted Griffin as a board member since June 2009, said it wouldn’t call a meeting.

About 20 minutes before Tuesday's 5 p.m. City Council meeting, a 200-strong crowd tried to get inside the packed City Hall. They were rebuffed by police officers who cited fire standards and would not let anyone else into the crowded council chambers, where the council held its regular meeting and talked about what the crowd was upset about: two police shootings over the weekend. A half-dozen officers blocked City Hall's entrance, while the crowd gathered around and hurled obscenities. As the crowd pressed closer, officers with helmets and batons came out the front door and pushed the protesters back, angering them. After several minutes, some protesters called for everyone to hit the street.

Those who support these laws claim they are needed to prevent "voter fraud," a crime that's about as common as shark attacks and spontaneous combustion. Since there are so few cases out there of voters pretending to be someone they aren't, supporters of voter suppression reach back into the historical record for precedent. One example they keep going back to is the 1960 presidential election, when JFK narrowly defeated Nixon. It has been an article of faith in conservative circles for years that mayor Richard J. Daley's political machine stuffed the ballot boxes with the names of the dead in order to secure the state of Illinois for Kennedy, which put him over the top in the electoral college. Leaving aside the fact that this accusation has never been proven true, it misses the real electoral manipulation in that election. In 1960, African Americans supported Kennedy by a wide margin, but throughout the South, due to discriminatory laws and intimidation, the vast majority of African Americans did not get to vote. Imagine such a situation today, if say in the Egyptian elections Coptic Christians were kept from voting by the Egyptian government. International observers from the UN and elsewhere would have attacked the election as invalid for purposefully targeting a minority group for exclusion from the polls. The American election of 1960, if held today, would not be considered legitimate in the eyes of the international community because of its overt racism. Of course, after five years of tireless protest and sacrifice by the civil rights movement, the Voting Rights Act would be passed in 1965, effectively destroying the old methods of official voter suppression in the South. Those practices had a long history. Before the Civil War, most states -North as well as South- had laws banning blacks from voting. Afterwards, in the midst of Reconstruction, the Fifteenth Amendment forbid the denial of the vote on the basis of race, color, or "prior servitude." When the so-called "Redeemers" came to power in the South on a wave of racist vigilante violence and overturned Reconstruction, they found ways around the Constitution. Poll taxes, violent intimidation, literacy tests, whites-only Democratic primaries, and the infamous "grandfather clause" all contributed to the suppression of the black vote.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343240774000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 14:26:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343240791000-67</Id><Topic><Title>Freiberg: Gambled with shareholders money......</Title><Username>brandish_mow</Username><Timestamp>1343170311000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 18:51:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thought to repost this.

Way back in 1915, in a case brought through the courts by the fledgling NAACP, the Supreme Court struck down the grandfather clause, and in 1962 the Twenty-Fourth Amendment invalidated the poll tax. Despite these changes, in 1964 only 6.7% of African Americans in Mississippi were registered to vote. Not until the Voting Rights Act, which the federal, rather than state government enforced, would real change occur. While a lot has changed since 1965, voter suppression has not gone away. In some cases this is the result of legislation making voting contingent on forms of ID that many Americans do not have. In other cases, the racism of the justice system leads to voter suppression. As Michelle Alexander has demonstrated in The New Jim Crow, the imbalanced waging of the war on drug has led to a disproportionate number of African Americans being convicted of drug felonies and then losing the right to vote. Many states that prevent convicted felons from voting not only replicate the racism of a criminal justice system that targets blacks more than whites,but have also prevented citizens from voting who share the same name as a felon. Beyond the legal system, there have been well-documented cases of deliberate misinformation about voting spread with the intent of suppressing the vote, often in predominately African American neighborhoods. During the Wisconsin recall election of Scott Walker, people who signed the petition to get him out of office received robocalls telling them they didn't need to vote. A similar thing happened in 2010 in Maryland. In Massachusetts two GOP operatives put up signs in a polling place demanding photo ID to vote, even though that was not a requirement for voting in the Bay State. It's become de rigeur for Republicans to hand out flyers intentionally misleading voters about what day the election will take place. As you can see, this nation has a long history of suppressing the vote -especially the votes of African Americans- which continues to this day. Despite this obvious fact, somehow our politicians are allowed to continue this suppression in the most aggressive fashion since Jim Crow while justifying their actions as a response to chimerical "voter fraud." It's time to change the public discourse, and part of that is using history to show that voter suppression has always been a much more significant problem in this nation's life than voter fraud.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343240809000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 14:26:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343240893000-69</Id><Topic><Title>don't you love the games?</Title><Username>vetfrc</Username><Timestamp>1343238814000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 13:53:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They drop the eps for 2014 by 35%.

The former Massachusetts governor claimed that alleged gunman in the Aurora, Colorado massacare, James Holmes, illegally obtained his weapons, when in fact Holmes legally purchased the firearms through various national gun chains. According to a transcript of an interview that will air Wednesday night on NBC Nightly News, the presidential candidate said “it was illegal for him to have many of those already,” and suggested that stronger gun laws would not have prevented the tragedy. Instead, Romney claimed that the way to deal with such senseless violence is by “changing the heart of the American people”: ROMNEY: Well this person shouldn’t have had any kind of weapons and bombs and other devices and it was illegal for him to have many of those things already. But he had them. And so we can sometimes hope that just changing the law will make all bad things go away. It won’t.

Bush’s during an interview with NBC’s Brian Williams on Wednesday, saying only that he would “take action to get America on track to have a balanced budget.” Bush increased the national debt by trillions of dollars. Rather than detailing specific differences with the former Republican president — whose deregulatory policies and massive tax cuts have been blamed for the nation’s current economic recession — Romney described his economic approach with his standard to his four-part talking points: WILLIAMS: And let’s talk about domestic– the economy before we wrap things up. The major planks of your job plan, lower taxes, both corporate and marginal rates, and reduce regulation. Explain how that would be different from what George W. Bush tried to push through? ROMNEY: Well, let me describe– actually, there are five things that I believe are necessary to get this economy going. One, take advantage of our energy resources, particularly natural gas, but also coal, oil, nuclear, renewables. That’s number one. A huge opportunity for us, and doing so is gonna bring manufacturing back, because low-cost, plentiful energy is key to manufacturing, in many industries. Number two, trade. I want tre– to dramatically increase trade and particularly with– with Latin America. Number three, take action to get America on track to have a balanced budget. Now those three things, by the way, are things which we have not been doing over the last few years, which I think are essential to getting this economy going again. Number four, we’ve got to show better training and education opportunities for our current re– workers and for coming workers. And then finally what I call restoring economic freedom. That means keep our taxes as low as possible, have regulations modern and up to date, get health care costs down. These things will restore economic freedom. So my policies are very different than anything you’ve seen in the past. They’re really designed for an America which has some new resources, energy being one of them, trade with Latin America being another, and the need for a balanced budget now more urgent than ever before. Indeed, Romney’s economic advisers are comprised of Bush’s old team, and his policies would double down on Bush’s failed economic approach. In April, Alexandra Franceschi, Specialty Media Press Secretary of the Republican National Committee, argued that Romney’s policies are like the “policies of the Bush administration…just updated” — and in some cases they’re even worse. For instance, Romney’s tax cut plan is four times larger than Bush’s, more heavily weighted to benefit the ultra wealthy and he opposes increasing the minimum wage. Romney also supports turning Medicare into a voucher program for future retirees, while Bush enacted a historic expansion of the Medicare program."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1343268515000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 22:08:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343268599000-108</Id><Topic><Title>HISTORY.......</Title><Username>thesilverman109</Username><Timestamp>1343231518000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 11:51:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound like the real JBMARIA, but I haven't been participating in the discussions much in the last year or two to know for sure.

On Wednesday, a new report from the Associated Press reveals that the former Massachusetts governor made several trips to Boston to meet with partners and other key employees at Bain Capital’s headquarters while running the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. The details contradict Romney’s claim that he did not interact with the company after leaving in February of 1999. From the piece: Several associates now say that Romney made repeated trips between Salt Lake and Boston, where he met at times with his former partners, mostly to discuss his severance from the firm. The Boston Globe reported last week that Romney also met with his Bain partners at a 15th anniversary celebration in Palm Beach, Fla., in early 1999. “I was in Salt Lake City for three straight years. I don’t recall even coming back once to go to a Bain or management meeting. We were, I was out there running the Olympics and it was a full time job, I can tell you that,” Romney told CBS’ Jan Crawford earlier this month in an effort to defend his role with the company. But one former senior Bain partner told the AP “that once Romney had accepted the Olympics position, he would ‘make suggestions but not decisions.’”</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1343269758000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-07-25 22:29:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343270613000-111</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on voters</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343153533000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 14:12:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FLA GOP leader confirm suppression of black vote" Jim Greer denounces Florida Republican Party officials as liars and 'whack-a-do, right-wing crazies' Source: Tampa Bay Times TALLAHASSEE — In a wide-ranging deposition that spanned two days in late May, former Florida Republican Party Chairman Jim Greer denounced some party officials as liars and "whack-a-do, right-wing crazies'' as he described turmoil in the months before his resignation.
