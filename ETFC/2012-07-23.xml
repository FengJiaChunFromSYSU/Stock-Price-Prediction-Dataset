Mark Pryor (D-AR).  In June 2007, Romney stepped up his criticism of the Bush Administration’s Iraq policy by publiclydenouncing the White House’s comparison of future troop presence in Iraq to our current presence in SouthKorea.  Romney hedged on endorsing troop surge and has been criticized for not talking enough about Iraq.  During June 2006 presidential debate, Romney incorrectly claimed weapons inspectors were not allowed toenter Iraq before the 2003 U.S. invasion.  When Romney finally endorsed the president’s troop surge proposal, he unintentionally endorsed larger surgethan was proposed by calling for extra regiment in Anbar province.  Romney said capturing Osama bin Laden would result in “very insignificant increase in safety” for Americaand such effort was “not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars” to catch one person.  After calling for economic divestment from Iran, Romney was embarrassed by revelation that the Italianbranch of Bain &amp; Company – firm where Romney started as young consultant and served as CEO in early‘90s – received $2.3 million contract from National Iranian Oil Company in 2004.  Bain Capital, the private equity firm that made Romney his fortune, currently owns a chemicals and paintcompany called SigmaKalon that operates an office in Tehran.  Romney has made favorable comments about plan offered by Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) to split Iraq into thirds.  Romney has proposed doubling the size of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and supports “enhancedinterrogation techniques.”  Romney called Cuban president Fidel Castro a “monster” and has taken hard line against the dictator, butmistakenly employed signature Castro slogan while speaking to largely Hispanic audience in Miami this year.  Romney praised 2005 plan by Citgo Petroleum Corp. – ultimately controlled by the Venezuelan governmentand President Hugo Chavez – to provide low-income Massachusetts residents with discounted heating oil.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343017315000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 00:21:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343019439000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Does the 2nd Amend Allow for Nukes ???</Title><Username>chuckiedamanson</Username><Timestamp>1342971265000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 11:34:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Murder is still against the law.

Gerard Hey, Romney, Let Voters See What You Showed McCain John McCain and Mitt Romney share a secret. It's 23 years of Mitt's tax returns. Mitt gave them to McCain in 2008 when McCain, then the GOP presidential nominee, was vetting VP candidates. This time around, Mitt has won the GOP nomination, but now he's hiding those 23 years of returns from the American people. He handed them to McCain in exchange for a VP bid. But Mitt is denying that information to the American people when he's asking them for something more important -- the presidency. Mitt, a quarter billionaire, disclosed his federal payments to fellow one percenter McCain, who owns so many houses he couldn't count them. To America's middle class riffraff, Mitt has divulged significantly less -- a partial return for 2010 and a promise of the 2011 return when he finishes it. Ann Romney told ABC reporter Robin Roberts last week that the riffraff need far less to determine who will be their President than McCain did to pick a VP. Here's what Ann said: We have given all you people need to know and understand about our financial situation and about how we live our life. You people. That would be the uppity riffraff who dare to question the rich Romneys. Mitt has explained all this before. He'll tell voters what's good for them. And what's good for them is part of one year's return and maybe another year later. That'll do it. Here's how he put it to CNN: People always want to get more. We're putting out what's required plus more. Those are the two years that people will have, and that's all that's necessary for people to understand something about my finances. That's all that's necessary. Got it? Mitt told you. Now go home and shut up about it. Mitt might do better with middle class voters if he got down off his high-steppin' dressage horse. But if he did that, he might never get taxpayers to repay him the $77,000 he lost on that horse. That $77,000 loss, an amount larger than most Americans earn in a year, was revealed in the partial return Romney did release. No wonder he's reluctant to disclose more. Ann Romney described Mitt's refusal to give additional years this way on ABC: There are so many things that will be open again for more attack. And you just want to give more material for more attack. And that's really -- that's just the answer. The answer, Ann Romney said, is that there are so many things in those secret returns that would provoke criticism. And the quarter billionaire running for president don't countenance no criticism from riffraff. Ann's fear is validated by the revelation of foreign accounts and inexplicable retirement funds contained in the one partial return Romney released so far. It's incomplete because attachments weren't included. When a taxpayer has foreign accounts, as Romney does, the IRS requires the filer to include specific documentation about them. Romney didn't release those for his account in Switzerland.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1343057266000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 11:27:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>19</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343057347000-55</Id><Topic><Title>Poll shows Brak Wrong Again</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1343056708000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 11:18:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jimmy Carter was the last successful business man to occupy the White House.

But all this scuffling hasn't taken into account an until-now unreported fact about Romney's days at Bain: When he was running the private equity firm, he invested tens of millions of dollars in a pair of companies that specialized in outsourcing high-tech manufacturing and that developed offshore production facilities in Mexico, China, and elsewhere to build electronics for US firms. In March 1999, shortly after Romney left Bain to take over the troubled Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Brookside Capital Investors Inc., a Bain-related entity wholly owned by Romney, filed a report with the Securities and Exchange Commission that listed dozens of companies in which Brookside held a stake the previous quarter. The roster included investments in Singapore-based Flextronics International ($13 million) and Florida-headquartered Jabil Circuit Inc. ($41 million), two companies that were leaders in the fast-growing field of outsourcing electronics manufacturing and offshoring production to low-wage countries. Together, these two investments represented almost 10 percent of Brookside's $559 million portfolio. For much of the 1990s, most overseas outsourcing involved unsophisticated products like apparel. But in the second half of that decade, US high-tech companies producing computers, telecommunications equipment, and other electronics began contracting out their manufacturing to firms that had established production facilities both in the United States and in overseas locales where labor was cheap. Such was the case with Flextronics and Jabil Circuit. They were two of a handful of companies that, according to the Los Angeles Times, "exploited the boon in high-tech outsourcing, or 'stealth' manufacturing," producing components or products for American businesses including Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Sun Microsystems, and Microsoft. When Romney was acquiring stakes in these two companies, they were hot tickets for investors. During the second half of 1998, the leading electronics manufacturing contractors—including Flextronics and Jabil Circuit—averaged an 85 percent boost in stock prices. That year, Flextronics doubled its revenues. "Outsourcing is good for America," declared Michael Marks, then-chairman and CEO of Flextronics. In the late 1990s, Flextronics built a facility in Guadalajara, Mexico, to serve its US clients, including Intel. A Wired magazine profile described the firm this way: "Incorporated in Singapore with its management offices in San Jose, Flextronics has factories worldwide. Its industrial parks, which house suppliers onsite, are concentrated in Brazil, China, Hungary, and Mexico. Workers earn from 70 cents per hour in China to $4.50 in Brazil…By manufacturing in low-cost regions, Flex can cut 75 percent of the price of labor."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343063321000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 13:08:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343064846000-71</Id><Topic><Title>You should pull this up (ETFC)</Title><Username>masakocvu4358</Username><Timestamp>1343053948000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 10:32:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will be waiting for more great news to come.</Msg><Username>bates_anne556</Username><Timestamp>1343064846000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 13:34:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343065345000-72</Id><Topic><Title>(E*TRADE Financial Corporation) - ready for a bounce.</Title><Username>ricardo_farley</Username><Timestamp>1343042532000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 07:22:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yea supposed to be huge</Msg><Username>herschel_kramer</Username><Timestamp>1343065345000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 13:42:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343065632000-73</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC is oversold and will bounce back to $8+ very soon!!</Title><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1343062075000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 12:47:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ETFC will fly after breaking through the small resistance at $7.26~7.27!

I realize there is some overhang from the legacy mortgage portfolio, but that is definitely working its way out. DART AMTD=355k. Client Assets=$445. Mkt Cap= 8.45 DART ETFC=139k. Client Assets=$193. Mkt Cap=2.07 All things being equal, a quick ratio analysis reflects a $1Billion Dollar+ valuation desrepancy for ETFC assuming AMTD is properly valued. This equates to about 3.50 per share for ETFC. Essentially ETFC should be trading above 10.50. AMTD and SCHW will eventually jump to get these brokerage assets. TD Bank (50% shareholder of AMTD) could easily absorb the recovering mortgage portfolio. Don't be surprised to see ETFC be taken out before years end for $3 Billion plus, or greater than 50% from where're stock price is today.

National Review are long-time Romney supporters; they endorsed him in 2008. Here is National Review’s editorial: The Romney campaign says he has released as many returns as candidate John Kerry did in 2004, and cites Teresa Heinz Kerry’s refusal to release any of her tax returns. Neither is an apt comparison [...] Romney may feel impatience with requirements that the political culture imposes on a presidential candidate that he feels are pointless (and inconvenient). But he’s a politician running for the highest office in the land, and his current posture is probably unsustainable. In all likelihood, he won’t be able to maintain a position that looks secretive and is a departure from campaign conventions. The only question is whether he releases more returns now, or later — after playing more defense on the issue and sustaining more hits. There will surely be a press feeding frenzy over new returns, but better to weather it in the middle of July.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1343067704000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 14:21:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>19</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343067727000-87</Id><Topic><Title>You should pull this up (ETFC)</Title><Username>masakocvu4358</Username><Timestamp>1343053948000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 10:32:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Glad you shared this to us.</Msg><Username>young_deborah573</Username><Timestamp>1343067727000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 14:22:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343067779000-88</Id><Title>Shorted GT @ 9.93</Title><Msg>but I could be wrong. tdc</Msg><Username>tradedotcom</Username><Timestamp>1343067779000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 14:22:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343068227000-89</Id><Title>Tuesday: 250+ up Rally!!</Title><Msg>Shorts will be toasted tomorrow!!

Even better, he held the event, which was billed as an ode to rugged individualism, while standing in front of a banner blaring the collectivist "We did built it!" slogan. ("We," not "I"?) As you might expect, response on Twitter was fast and furious: Of the business owners with Romney today, three are described as being federal contractors, two defense contractors. — @GingerGibson via TweetDeck If you're the military industrial complex, you didn't build that — @samyoungman via web I'm confused. The guv is sitting down with defense contractors for a "you didn't build that" event? — @samyoungman via web Note that 3 of these business owners whose work depends on govt contracts (per Romney campaign), sit in front of a "We DID build it" sign. — @Rebecca_CBSNJ via Twitter for BlackBerryÂ® That is one badly put-together line-up in terms of your messaging, Team Romney. Good Lord. — @LizMair via web Romney campaign's list of participants at small business roundtable notes 3 of 11 attendees sell to federal govt or have federal contracts — @GarrettNBCNews via Twitter for iPad Bizarre. RT @samyoungman: I'm confused.

And that came a day after Romney said he actually agreed with President Obama about government playing an essential role in helping businesses thrive. And let's not forget Romney's 2002 message to Olympians: "You didn't get here solely on your own."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1343080049000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 17:47:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343080731000-121</Id><Topic><Title>it takes absolutely no talent</Title><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1343072593000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 15:43:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Or maybe Bhatia simply was right, ETFC built an unsustainable, deeply flawed franchise being kept alive for years now by the unwitting support of shareholders ?
