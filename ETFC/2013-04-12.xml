In 1996 he opened "needs based" veterans programs and it flooded the system to the point where it broke. The VA was SUPPOSED to get automatic re-imbursement from Medicare for these patients, but that required an act of Congress as opposed to the Presidential Fiat by which he implemented the first half of the plan. Needless to say, and as Bill Clinton no doubt expected, Congress did NOT allow money to be taken from Medicare and as a result many Medicare and totally uninsured people who did perhaps 4 years total in the military started getting free health care at the local VA. President Bush put a stop to MOST needs based programs after the start of the Gulf War, but those that had thought to sign up in the meantime were grandfathered in. Bonuses to VA Administrators were shifted from being based on patient satisfaction surveys to based on how much they came in off their budget for the year as there is NO patient satisfaction at this time with most VA facilities, and with some they should be closed down and the staff, particularly administrative staff, purged and replaced with people who have "other" priorities. And NO MORE STUPID AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HIRING. Please!! The VA ends up getting the dregs of the nursing community because almost everything is affirmative action based in one way or another. President Obama, pushing Obamacare, once said he considered the Veterans Administration the model of socialized medicine because of how well it worked. This is how well it works. I'm a priority 1 100% disabled veteran and I have a list of things the VA is supposed to do (we're talking bare bones here) going back 10 years that they either haven't figured out how to do, it's "being worked on", or, frankly, whatever excuse for not doing it they can come up with at the moment. So, though was criticism intended, irony you did produce.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1365787420081</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 13:23:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365787735639-10</Id><Topic><Title>Crazy Doesn't Even Describe This One...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1365710602726</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 16:03:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah for leaving power tools plugged in so that idiotic customers could come along and test how sharp each was by cutting a bit off themselves.

For the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face." Madeleine Albright, Feb. 18, 1998. "He will use those weapons of mass destruction again, as he has ten times since 1983." Sandy Berger, Clinton National Security Adviser, Feb. 18, 1998. "We urge you, after consulting with Congress, and consistent with the U.S. Constitution and laws, to take necessary actions (including, if appropriate, air and missile strikes on suspect Iraqi sites) to respond effectively to the threat posed by Iraq's refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs." Letter to President Clinton, signed by Sens. Carl Levin, Tom Daschle, John Kerry, and others Oct. 9, 1998. "As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I am keenly aware that the proliferation of chemical and biological weapons is an issue of grave importance to all nations. Saddam Hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process." Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D, CA), Dec. 16, 1998. “Earlier today, I ordered America's armed forces to strike military and security targets in Iraq. They are joined by British forces.
