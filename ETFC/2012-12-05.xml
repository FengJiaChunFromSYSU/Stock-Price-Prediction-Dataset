A stalking horse price is put up for 10 contracts, and the market maker puts the next offering well above or below that as it suits them. Now since they can enter "false orders" into the execution cue, pulling their previous bids or asks even as your order enters the queue, MAYBE you get those 10 contracts traded, and maybe you don't, if they had time to move the price peg. Basically you're trying to trade a thinly traded issue during crunch time while working against a computer. At that point all you CAN do is make a market sale and hope to get SOMETHING out of the things before they expire just SO barely in the money they force an exercise. Oh, if you have barely in the money options that are going to execute you can stop that execution and surrender the options by calling eTrade customer service Friday evening. Note that a similar thing can happen with thinly traded stocks, but at least those don't expire or cause you to make an outlay of funds... Suggest from now on you sell the day BEFORE expiration. Further you need either alot of contracts going in one sale and at least a few cents profit on each to make them even worth the commission price of selling them on the last day. Putting in a sell order at 4pm on the Friday before expiration is NOT the way to do that.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1354701300525</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 04:55:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354741776909-2</Id><Title>Shut her down</Title><Msg>Better to shut the mess down by hitting the debt limit.

"There's two obvious ones that people ask me about, but one is privately held. The individual is not interested," Tomczyk said at a Goldman Sachs conference Tuesday when asked about big acquisition opportunities. "The other one still has some balance sheet issues to work through." Tomczyk did not identify the firms. Analysts, investors and a person close to TD Ameritrade said they were certain that the firms Tomczyk was referring to were Scottrade, whose biggest shareholder remains its founder, Rodger Riney, and E*Trade. A spokesman at E*Trade declined to comment. A Scottrade spokeswoman did not return calls for comment. E*Trade, which expanded beyond discount brokerage into selling mortgages and other consumer loans through an online bank more than a decade ago, has suffered years of losses since the financial crisis. In an indirect reference to E*Trade, Tomczyk said its home equity loan book remains problematic. Citadel LLC, the hedge fund that is E*Trade's biggest shareholder, pressed directors in 2011 to sell the firm after "nearly four years of value destruction and lost opportunity." E*Trade has whittled its ailing loan portfolio by billions of dollars, but in October reported an unexpected third-quarter loss that signaled to investors that credit remains a problem. Tomczyk's pessimism went beyond E*trade to acquisitions in general. When interest rates are so low, "revenue synergies" don't exist, he said, adding that TD Ameritrade is not having "concrete discussions" with anyone. The real gold in merging discount brokers lies in moving client cash out of money-market funds into bank accounts and investing it at a profit, according to Tomczyk. That can't be done when rates are close to zero and the yield curve is relatively flat. "It makes transactions harder to do unless you're willing to stand back and say, 'In the long term this will work out,'" he said. &#127; TD Ameritrade, whose major shareholder is Tomczyk's former employer, TD Bank, burgeoned through much of the previous decade through purchases of other brokers and businesses. The Omaha, Nebraska-based firm has not made a large purchase since buying options broker Thinkorswim Group in 2009 for more than $600 million. "Some people would say, 'Well you're not investing, you can't keep that growth up,'" Tomczyk said. "I can tell you we are investing." TD Ameritrade had $915 million of cash as of Sept. 30 that it is deploying in hiring salespeople, improving technology and expand into the retirement brokerage business. It also is supplementing its equities-heavy menu with access to potentially higher-yielding - but riskier - products such as futures and foreign exchange, Tomczyk said. Known primarily for appealing to active, self-directed stock investors, the firm booked 40 percent of its trade volume last quarter from options, futures and foreign exchange transactions. It also is using cash to salve shareholder issues. TD Ameritrade, which did not pay a dividend until 2010, has raised its 2013 quarterly payout by 50 percent to 9 cents per share. Agreements with TD Bank and the Ricketts family, the founders of TD Ameritrade, restrict the company from doing more share buybacks that would push the bank into a majority shareholder. Tomczyk said TD Ameritrade has not been able to get either of its principal shareholders to amend their agreements. Shares of TD Ameritrade closed up 0.6 percent to $16.25 on Wednesday. Shares of E*Trade finished up 2.0 percent at $8.54.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1354744249757</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 16:50:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354750895872-4</Id><Topic><Title>Illinois state Sen.

This is number one. The number two is that I predict a hyperinflation in America, because this is the only tool available with the president who does not like to cut the entitlements [Search google for: Welfare State Grows by Nearly 19% Under Obama â€“ to Almost $1 Trillion a Year] and support growing number of people on food stamps to create more creatures voting for the democrats. This president will ruin this country after he was re-elected by millions of ignorants and racists who did not vote for him because of his accomplishments, because there are none. My question was simple. Will the stocks trade at the current price x 1000 (or higher or lower than that,) if the average weekly salary is a million bucks in 2014 and we have to pay $2,700 for a cheesburger at McDonalds? I am moving away from cash and stocks now. My disclosure: My last move following taking a large amount of cash out of my ETrade Brokerage account was to move another large amount of money from there this week to purchase gold Rolex with 372 diamonds "Mother Of Pearl Diamond Dial Beadset Bezel Day Date Super President." Bid ps: Yahoo does not allow to post articles anymore to suck more than before. Yahoo site is slow like the people that voted for Obama. all imho</Msg><Username>bid100k</Username><Timestamp>1354761703056</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 21:41:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
