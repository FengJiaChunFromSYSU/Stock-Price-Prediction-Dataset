His limo was shipped by the air force because he needs a motorcade, he is just so important, the pompous, tax payers money spending King Obimbo! And Smutchelle of course had to go to Aspen with her litter to spend more tax payer money. (It's been just such a long time after their Hawaiian vacation, they must be exhausted - from spending) Time for the IDIOT to go! (One way or another!)

Vincent Fox was a genius, he closed the boarder to his south, and opened the boarder to his north to rid himself of his poor and potencial political trouble makers...kind of like the keystone pipeline for illegals from Mexico to the USA.... Are we collectively as a nation this stupid? Report: $2 billion spent annually for Medicaid emergencies, largely for illegal immigrant baby deliveries Even though federal law largely bars illegal immigrants from obtaining Medicaid coverage, the program annually pays out more than $2 billion in free emergency coverage that mostly goes to illegal immigrants, according to Kaiser Health News. The vast majority of the total emergency care reimbursements cover delivering babies, Kaiser reports. Based on a Kaiser data analysis of the states believed to have the greatest populations of illegal immigrants —including California, New York, Texas, North Carolina, Arizona, Illinois and Florida — more than 100,000 people annually receive emergency care that is reimbursed by Medicaid. California, Kaiser’s analysis showed, receives approximately half of the annual $2 billion Medicaid expenditure category.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1361058147775</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 18:42:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361065453502-3</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo mates Unicorn with Bigfoot!</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1360799357924</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 18:49:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's to say? Aside from a potential surprise announcement (unlikely, financials are mostly boring), we're just waiting for next quarters earnings to see how the strategic picture has changed. I'm leary of saying a strong buy at this level unless you have no position at all, but I wouldn't take all my position at once here. I'd rather chance averaging up my allotted ETFC investment than diving in all at once and then seeing it drop to $9 range for another 3 months. I've got a decent position in this stock already so for me it's just a buy, for now. However I have other Strong Buy's (which this was) still under-invested, so I imagine I'm just sitting on my position for now.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1361065453502</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 20:44:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361066088152-4</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo mates Unicorn with Bigfoot!</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1360799357924</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 18:49:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why not go swap spit wif the prescient prognosticator who posted recently calling for a fifty-bagger in the near future?</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1361066088152</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 20:54:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
