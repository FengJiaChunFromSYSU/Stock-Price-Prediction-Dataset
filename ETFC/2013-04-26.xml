"The foreclosure rate among subprime borrowers in Texas, at less than 19 percent, is the lowest of any state except Alaska. Part of the reason is that Texas didn't experience the stratospheric run-ups in home prices that other states did. On average, the home-resale prices of the 20 metro areas in the Case-Shiller Home Price Index peaked in 2006 after more than doubling since 2000. In Dallas, one of the 20 areas, they rose just 25 percent, gradually, and have barely declined. But there is a broader secret to Texas's success, and Washington reformers ought to be paying very close attention. If there's one thing that Congress can do to help protect borrowers from the worst lending excesses that fueled the mortgage and financial crises, it's to follow the Lone Star State's lead and put the brakes on "cash-out" refinancing and home-equity lending.

No one, including insurance companies, know how this is going to play out. The GOP suffered a severe setback when Eric Cantor tried to have people with pre-existing conditions go through a high-risk insurance plan before they are able to get onto Obamacare. Cantor's plan was rejected by a majority of GOP lawmakers.</Msg><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1366997746436</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:35:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367000644108-9</Id><Title>A Cronkite Moment for the Blowback Era</Title><Msg>A Cronkite Moment for the Blowback Era By David Sirota “The stuff we have done overseas is now brought back into our own front yards. America’s chickens are coming home to roost.”—Reverend Jeremiah Wright In 2008, the hysterical backlash to the above comment by Barack Obama’s minister became a high-profile example of one of the most insidious rules in American politics: You are not allowed to honestly discuss the Central Intelligence Agency’s concept of “blowback” without putting yourself at risk of being deemed a traitor to country. Now, five years later, with America having killed thousands of Muslim civilians in its drone strikes and wars, that rule is thankfully being challenged—and not by someone who is so easily smeared. Instead, the apostate is one of this epoch’s most revered journalists—and because of that, we will see whether this country is mature enough to face one of its biggest national security quandaries. This is the news from Tom Brokaw’s appearance on “Meet the Press” last Sunday. Discussing revelations that the bombing suspects may be connected to Muslim fundamentalism, he said: “We have got to look at the roots of all of this because it exists across the whole (Asian) subcontinent and the Islamic world around the world. I think we also have to examine (America’s) use of drones (because) there are a lot of civilians who are innocently killed in a drone attack in Pakistan, in Afghanistan and in Iraq. And I can tell you having spent a lot of time over there, young people will come up to me on the streets and say, ‘We love America, but if you harm one hair on the head of my sister, I will fight you forever.’ And there is this enormous rage against what they see in that part of the world as a presumptuousness of the United States.”</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1367000644108</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 14:24:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367001941904-10</Id><Title>Shooting every six hours</Title><Msg>Obama doesn't give a ratz #$%$ about the homicide rate in his hometown...their just poor blacks with no money to contribute....

That works out to 3.8 shootings per day or approximately one shooting every 6.3 hours. The "Crime in Chicago" blog updates daily and tracks crime news within the city. It keeps a running tally of all homicides and shootings. In 2012, the blog shows that 2,670 individuals were shot in Chicago. That was up 20% from 2,217 in 2011. Likewise, the number of homicides in 2012 was 535, up 21% from 441 in 2011.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1367001941904</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 14:45:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367003848236-11</Id><Topic><Title>Blast in West, Texas</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1366739468541</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:51:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good point.</Msg><Username>muchomacho42</Username><Timestamp>1367003848236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 15:17:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367004542528-12</Id><Title>ETrade Just Ate My Portfolio</Title><Msg>One second it was there, the next, gone as if . . . well, as if their lame butt database server croaked.

So, the ubiquitous sequester cannot be blamed entirely on this annual spring-time airline experience. Funny thing; waaaaaaaaaay back in 1982 when ALL of the air traffic controllers were FIRED by mssr. Reagon, nary a peek was heard from Republicans about the significance of not having controllers mann the skies or the hardships to consumers resulting from firing an entire safety link in our U.S. transportation system. So, please spare the gloom &amp; doom rants; the sequester was SUPPOSED to be so egregious, it would compel congress to get off their cushy seats and do the people's business. This airport delay fiasco should actually be a sign of relief to all who rant the "limited government" mantra- you know- get government off our backs, too much regulation etc etc etc. Like spoiled little kids, we want our government only to fix things when it affects US, but if it doesn't impact my life- who cares.</Msg><Username>dems_win</Username><Timestamp>1367031324775</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 22:55:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367031351819-22</Id><Topic><Title>Blast in West, Texas</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1366739468541</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:51:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All states try and bring in any new businesses.

This Band-Aid approach "ought to be grounds for bipartisan outrage," says David Graham at The Atlantic. Congress abdicated its responsibility when it allowed the "Sword of Damocles" sequester cuts to take effect. "Now that the automatic cuts have actually taken place," says Graham, "Congress once again wants to sidestep its own work in such a way that spares a small portion of the population — a portion that just happens to include them!" Unlike previous sequester effects which mostly hurt the already economically, socially, or geographically marginalized in American society, these cuts were going to get serious, because they were hitting Northeast Corridor elites where it hurt: On the DCA-LGA shuttle. [The Atlantic] It's not just that the flight delays affect members of Congress, says Alex Pareene at Salon. They affect the wealthy, and studies have proved what we already knew: "Politicians are quite responsive to the views of their rich constituents, but not particularly concerned with anyone else." So if you happen to "rely on food pantries and Head Start and Meals on Wheels and unemployment benefits," or are a middle class government worker, Pareene elaborates, you'll continue to feel the pain from this senseless, easily fixed fiscal snafu.
