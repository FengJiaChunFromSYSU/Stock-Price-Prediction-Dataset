The Journal criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke for parroting "the tales of horror that are circulating on Wall Street and Washington about the savage impact of federal spending cuts." Wrote the Journal, in reference to spending cuts in the 1980s and 1990s: "In the last 30 years, Congress has made two major efforts to reduce federal spending, and both times the economy performed well." The Journal outlined "two distinct fiscal cliffs ahead: first, the rise in tax rates because the Bush reductions are set to expire under current law. This is dangerous and should be postponed pending a reform of the tax code." The newspaper wrote of the beginning of $1.2 trillion of automatic spending cuts set to take place over the next decade: "The economic impact of all of those spending cuts would be benign, even beneficial." The Journal concluded: "After a five-year spending binge and $5 trillion in new debt, markets want to know if Washington can control its tax and spending appetites. Any such signal would be bullish for growth. In the faux debate between growth and austerity, the Keynesians have deliberately confused the terms. They want to impose austerity on the private economy with tax increases. But for the private economy to grow faster, we need austerity for the government."
