And the money is in Washington." Hahahahaha: Romney wasn't just the head of the Salt Lake Organizing Committee. Romney was also a registered lobbyist for the organization, Utah state records show. Romney last worked as a lobbyist on Dec. 31, 2000, according to a spokesman for the state lieutenant governor, who oversees the registry. And it turns out he was a pretty good lobbyist ... at least as far as getting taxpayer funding is concerned. Romney secured nearly $400 million from state and local government in Utah, plus an additional $1.3 billion dollars from the federal government. That was more than twice the federal funding the Atlanta Olympics had gotten just six years earlier. As you may recall, Romney bragged about his skill at lobbying the government for money during his gubernatorial campaign. You can watch him do it in the video at the top of this post. So the next time Mitt Romney falsely accuses President Obama of being a "crony capitalist" or of being an ideologue who wants to put government in charge of everything, remember that Romney himself was a lobbyist who not only squeezed record breaking sums from local, state, and federal governments, but he bragged about it.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1343315673000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 11:14:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343316168000-29</Id><Topic><Title>USA Wins First Olympics Event !</Title><Username>monsewer_america</Username><Timestamp>1343315410000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 11:10:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>USA team ALWAYS get easy brackets.

That date has been repeated by Romney and his team throughout the presidential campaign. But a growing pile of evidence shows that Romney was involved in Bain's dealings far longer than he claims. From signatures on Securities and Exchange Commission filings to his own sworn testimony, this body of proof reveals how Romney's fingerprints lingered on Bain transactions well into 2002, even while he was managing the Olympics. While the Romney camp and other Republicans have blasted attacks on the former governor's business record as unfair, irrelevant, and "out of control," the inconsistencies between Romney's claims and the documents trail may be very significant to his campaign. While the issue of honesty may prove to be a sticking point with voters, the implication that Romney was still in an active role while Bain was involved in deals that sent American jobs overseas may cut even deeper."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1343323511000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:25:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343324377000-46</Id><Title>Stock Price is Pressed Down!!</Title><Msg>This is a manipulation!!

Now, the above reasons are for holding for a longer term than August or September, but one never knows when a catalyst will come around and goose the stock up a point or two. In the next few weeks, you should at least get a dead cat bounce. As for me, I am in this until the mortgage subsidiary turns or the company is bought out. Even a hint of improvement would cause the price to pop.

In a move that astonished Downing Street, hours before it laid on a special reception for Romney at No 10 he told NBC there were "disconcerting" signs about the preparations for the Games. One senior Whitehall source said: "What a total shocker. We are speechless." David Cameron wasted no time in slapping down Romney hours after his remarks were broadcast. On a visit to the Olympic Park, the prime minister said: "We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world.

The Detroit automaker has seen its share price tumble by more than 52 percent since it reached a high closing price in January 2011 of $38.90, just after going public in November 2010. The company has shed more than $30 billion in market capitalization over the last 18 months, and now is worth about $29 billion. The fall came as Ford Motor Co. announced Wednesday that second quarter earnings declined on larger-than-expected losses in Europe. GM's low stock price has prevented the Treasury from exiting the automaker. It still holds 500 million shares of stock in the company as part of its $49.5 billion bailout, or a 32 percent stake. It needs about $53 a share in order to break even on its GM bailout.

Mr market at the time had the stock at $15 because mr market thought there would be a premium from that price in a buyout. Mr market is not wrong alot. In open defiance of reality, and economics, the team of Freiberg, Audette, Griffin, Weaver, and Parks elected to go hard on the concept of not selling. So much so that they elected to announce it publicly. This signal was read by many that the company was worth vastly more than $15, and the prize was within reach. 20 or 25 could be in reach within say A Year. Well, one year has elapsed. Hmmmm. Something is certainly awry. Management did not have enough foresight to look forward one year to see continued trouble in the olb sector, trouble in Europe, and trouble with nim. A colassal mess up.

In an effort to avoid being blamed for holding middle class tax cuts hostage, Senate Republicans today caved and allowed the rarest of rarities: an actual up-or-down, majority vote on a bill. They gambled that Democrats didn’t have the votes to pass their plan — and they lost. The Republican plan, which gives the wealthiest 2 percent another handout they don’t need and we cannot afford while raising taxes on more than 25 MILLION middle and working class families, failed to attract even 50 votes. It went down 45 votes to 54, with even Republican Sens. Scott Brown (MA) and Susan Collins (ME) voting no. By contrast, the Democratic plan, which preserves and even enhances tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, passed on a vote of 51 to 48. Zero Republicans voted to support this plan, while all but two are now on the record in favor of billions of dollars in tax hikes on the middle class. Now that the Senate has acted, it couldn’t be clearer who is to blame if middle class taxes go up in January: Republicans — and Republicans alone. House Republicans are now literally the only thing standing in the way of tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans. IN ONE SENTENCE: Now that the Senate has acted, it’s time for House Republicans to stop holding middle class tax cuts hostage and immediately pass a bill extending them — and them alone.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343337348000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 17:15:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343337725000-91</Id><Topic><Title>Hmmm something isnt right here</Title><Username>brandish_mow</Username><Timestamp>1343334086000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 16:21:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Okay, I'll agree, but, that assumes 2 10:1 reverse splits.

Krauthammer said that all Romney has to do is say nothing and come out of the trip looking better on U.S.-Britain relations than the president, and he messed up on the first day. Regarding Prime Minister David Cameron‘s quip that you could easily hold the Olympics in “the middle of nowhere,” Krauthammer said he was clearly referring to Utah, the state where Romney helped run the Winter Olympics in 2002. He said that Romney’s comments on the London Olympics were “unbelievable,” “incomprehensible,” and “a lot of other adjectives.” Krauthammer said Romney shouldn’t be saying anything on his international trip, except for kind words about the countries he is visiting. “All Romney has to do, say nothing. It’s like a guy in the 100-meter dash. All he has to do is to finish, he doen’t have to win. And instead, he tackles the guy in the lane next to him and ends up disqualified.
