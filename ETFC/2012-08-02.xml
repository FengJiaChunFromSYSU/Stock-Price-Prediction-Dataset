Its the weak management and utter lack of communication thar allows nefarious intetests to play with the currency of the company. With stronger management and more frequent communication this would not happen. I wouldn't expect anything more. The management team has no idea how to promote the strength of this company. They save it all for a quarterly call. A company in this position needs more pr. They will not get it from a mid level banker from a failed bank and an accountant. Instead, what you get is manipulators emboldened by the lack of perceived direction from the company, which is made worse by shareholders skittish about the company and the macros This job is actually well over the heads of this management group.

The total for silver medalists is about $5,400 while it is $3,500 for third-place finishers. The ATR says the US is one of the only countries in the world to charge such a tax.

GRAETZ PRESSURE is mounting for Mitt Romney to release more of his financial records. Mr. Romney has made public only his 2010 tax returns and has said his 2011 documents will be released soon. “That’s all that’s necessary for people to understand something about my finances,” he said recently. He is “simply not enthusiastic,” he also said, about giving the Obama campaign “hundreds or thousands of more pages to pick through, distort and lie about.” But it is a good bet that Mr. Romney’s vetters have picked through more than two years of returns of his vice-presidential contenders. And the Senate typically requires more for confirmation to a cabinet or even a subcabinet post. Until Mr. Romney recognizes the right of voters to understand the finances of their leaders, all we are left with is speculation. Some commentators have suggested, for example, that — like tens of thousands of other Americans who have taken advantage of an Internal Revenue Service amnesty — he might not have declared and paid taxes on his Swiss bank account. I can’t imagine that he would have engaged in such blatant tax cheating. He is far too smart for that. Another suggestion is that in 2009 he paid income taxes significantly below the 13.9 percent he paid in 2010. This is more plausible, and potentially more damaging politically, even if perfectly legal. After all, the one year’s tax returns that he has released raise doubt about his campaign’s claims that his offshore accounts did not save him one penny of tax. Putting business assets into an individual retirement account invested in a Cayman Islands corporation allows Mr. Romney to avoid the “unrelated business income tax” — a 35 percent levy — on at least some of his I.R.A.’s earnings, a tax that he would have had to pay if his I.R.A. were held directly by a financial institution in the United States. With an I.R.A. account of $20 million to $101 million, the tax savings would be more than a few pennies. The I.R.A. also allows Mr. Romney to diversify his large holdings tax-free, avoiding the 15 percent tax on capital gains that would otherwise apply. His financial disclosure further reveals that his I.R.A. freed him from paying currently the 35 percent income tax on hundreds of thousands of dollars of interest income each year.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343932147000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 14:29:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343932190000-77</Id><Topic><Title>Taxing Medalists????</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1343923860000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 12:11:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why wouldn't they be taxed on income?</Msg><Username>idiologus</Username><Timestamp>1343932190000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 14:29:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343932213000-78</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Gaffe Fest Continues ......</Title><Username>drill_baby_drillllllll</Username><Timestamp>1343920978000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 11:22:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"How can you even trust McCain with vetting..."

Otherwise it is quite a trick to turn contributions that are limited to $30,000 to $50,000 a year into the $20 million to $101 million he now has there. But we cannot be certain; his meager disclosure of tax records and financial information does not indicate what kind of assets were put into the I.R.A. Mr. Romney’s Cayman Islands and Bermuda corporations also probably allowed him to avoid limitations on deductions for investment expenditures that would otherwise apply. So we don’t need any more tax returns to know that Mr. Romney is an Olympic-level athlete at the tax avoidance game. Rich people don’t send their money to Bermuda or the Cayman Islands for the weather.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343932345000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 14:32:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>16</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343932422000-81</Id><Title>I added more at $7.25~7.26!!!</Title><Msg>$7.25 was the bottom!!!

Republicans have never supported women or Hispanics. But you’ve got to admit, she is pretty darn cute.” Steve Schmidt, the former advisor to John McCain’s 2008 presidential bid, likes the move. “She’s trained and housebroken, which is a lot more than what we had to work with, plus she’s a rescue dog, so they won’t have to worry about that fu#*$d-up family like the Palins brought to the table.” When reminded that Paquita, despite her cuteness, was a dog and not a person, the Romney aide shot back, “Dogs are people.

On Tuesday, state regulators announced that California’s three big investor-owned utilities – Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric and Southern California Edison – had reached a mandated target – called the renewable portfolio standard, or RPS, to obtain at least 20% of the electricity they sell from renewable sources. In 2011, the three utilities collectively secured 20.6% of the electricity sold to retail customers from solar, wind, geothermal and other renewable power generation. Southern California led the field with 21.1% of sales coming from renewables, followed by SDG&amp;G at 20.8% and PG&amp;E at 20.1%. In fact, “2011 showed the greatest year-to-year increase in the capacity of renewable generation achieving commercial operation since the beginning of the program, and 2012 is already on track to far surpass 2011,” stated the California Public Utilities Commission in a report released Tuesday.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343940234000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 16:43:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343940406000-125</Id><Topic><Title>Wimp's rumored VP choice</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343939627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 16:33:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;&lt;Paquita, a three pound female Chihuahua from Arizona&gt;&gt; She would be an improvement over the gaffe meister Joe Biden.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343940406000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 16:46:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343940701000-126</Id><Topic><Title>Can be done</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343940234000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 16:43:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One more reason to leave Mexifornia, high utilities bills.

The only dodger I'm aware of is Romney, though Bush came close. 2nd - you could not get drafted for Vietnam War into the German Air Force you claim you were part of. 3rd - I have nothing against anyone who was drafted into a war. How could I? They had no choice but to do what they were told. I also have nothing against carreer soldiers, marines, etc. It's a job. It's a living. Often it's the best way available to get from here to there, so if it works for them - great. I DO see a problem when the same soldiers begrudge and belittle other public sector workers when they themselves are/were public employees. I know that feeling of superiority is bred into soldiers for psychological reasons, but most are able to separate military mentality from their civilian life. 4th - the salary and benefits soldiers receive is a pittance of US military budget. That's not where the savings could be found. I DO think US is spending way to much money for the military (about 5 times too much) - but most of it goes into the pockets of companies that make B2's, M1 Tanks and gazillion of other useless equipment. So stop with the overblown drama flyer boy! 5th - I have no issue with Government Workers AT ALL. They work hard, usually get paid less than private market equivalents. They do that in exchange for the promise of PENSION. It is YOU, not me to begrudge them this benefit (which was PART OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT) even though you get yours from 3M... somehow thinking ONLY YOU earned yours.... 6th - we ALMOST agree on taxes. I think the current tax code should be replaced with "use tax" - basically - a sales tax, with higher tax levels for luxury items and no tax at all on food. 7th - of course you don't expect me to understand anything you say. For that to happen - you would have to stop spewing hate and start making sense. Now...... Stop trashing about in your misguided anger. Or at least stop being proud of being constantly angry. You are old - I get it. But you say you live a good life? Why don't you let OTHERS do the same? Where is all your anger coming from?

Wir hatten schon vor einiger Zeit unsere Meinungen ausgetauscht. Ich werde im Dezember 75 Jahre alt. Meine Mutter war vom Boarischen Woid und ich arbeitete einige Jahre in Niederbayern, und zwar in Deggendorf, Regen Zwiesel, Bischofmais, u.a.m. Meine Mutter sang oft das Lied 'Mir san vom Woid dahoam' und ich sagte zu ihr 'des g'foit mir scho. Geschmeckt hat mir Knoedel mit Schwammerl, Leberkas, Leberknoedelsuppe und saemtliche Wurstwaren. rowdy, Now, I'm not so sure I should have agreed with you in regard to taxing Olympic medalists. I simply wanted to know more. On my way to the gym I fiddled around on the radio dial of my car and by shear luck I got conservative talk show host Tom Sullivan out of New York. When I agreed with you I was under the impression that this is a new tax, but it isn't a new tax at all. Tom Sullivan said, he can't understand what Marco Rubio is complaining about. This tax has been around for ever and it is called income tax that applies to everyone who generates an income. The tax also apllies to people who win at game shows on TV (Alex Trebek)and gambling casinos.</Msg><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1343956402000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 21:13:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343957629000-167</Id><Topic><Title>Fed buying GM cars</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343941551000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 17:05:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Slayer, shut up alredy you Log Cabin sissie!

Harry Reid: “There is a controversy because the Republican presidential nominee, Governor Mitt Romney, refuses to release his tax returns. As I said before, I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for ten years. People who make as much money as Mitt Romney have many tricks at their disposal to avoid paying taxes. We already know that Romney has exploited many of these loopholes, stashing his money in secret, overseas accounts in places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. “Last weekend, Governor Romney promised that he would check his tax returns and let the American people know whether he ever paid a rate lower than 13.9 percent. One day later, his campaign raced to say he had no intention of putting out any further information. “When it comes to answering the legitimate questions the American people have about whether he avoided paying his fair share in taxes or why he opened a Swiss bank account, Romney has shut up. But as a presidential candidate, it’s his obligation to put up, and release several years’ worth of tax returns just like nominees of both parties have done for decades. “It’s clear Romney is hiding something, and the American people deserve to know what it is. Whatever Romney’s hiding probably speaks volumes about how he would approach issues that directly impact middle-class families, like tax reform and the economy. When you are running for president, you should be an open book. “I understand Romney is concerned that many people, Democrats and Republicans, have been calling on him to release his tax returns. He has so far refused.</Msg><Username>elksmember</Username><Timestamp>1343963198000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 23:06:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>37</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343963570000-171</Id><Topic><Title>Mittens is hiding something</Title><Username>elksmember</Username><Timestamp>1343963198000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 23:06:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tonight on CNN AC360, Anderson Copper opened his 'keeping them honest' segment with Sen. Harry Reid's recent tax allegation about Mitt Romney. Cooper had CNN Capitol Hill reporter, Dana Bash on to discuss the story, according to Bash, her source can confirm Sen. Reid's allegation. Bash went even further, she said this source also personally knows the Bain source who would have access to Romney's tax record. If this Bain source story is true, then, Mitt Romney is in serious trouble. I'll have more later.</Msg><Username>dems_win</Username><Timestamp>1343963570000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 23:12:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>35</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343964773000-172</Id><Topic><Title>Taxing Medalists????</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1343923860000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 12:11:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rowdy brings income from Germany and thinks that if he does not have to declare it at the border - he can pretend it does not exist!
