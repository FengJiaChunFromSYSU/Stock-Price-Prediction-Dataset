New data which suggests that we have twice the amount of oil and NG then we thought, the drilling in the private - not federal land, because Obimbo doesn't allow it - and eventually the building of the Keystone pipeline (if Obimbo allows it or not) is bringing prices down. ND alone has "unlimited supply"! Next because of the miserable economy created by Obimbo, the lay offs, the unemployment and reduction in manufactureing is bringing demand down - so the prices fall! Also the belt tightening by the traveling/vacationing public leaves the pumps full! As to NG, it might not even pay off to drill any more new wells at this time or the "shipping costs" are going to be higher then the product! We could be independent, supplying our own needed supplies and the Arabs will beg us to buy their oil - there is only so much India, China and Japan is going to need - especially China investing in nuclear power and NG to switch away from oil! So get your facts straight beofre you make #$%$ statements! Based on Supply and Demand, I can see Gasoline dropping to an average of $3.50 and up here in the north to $3.25 and below $3 with the discount cards - I already filled last week paying $3.32!

Trading "in and out" is certainly tons of fun,&amp; full of risk, but we are all tempted, and we do often do it. When a stock like CSCO or MSFT or INTC or ETFC makes a big move you can end up missing the big dollars. So with ETFC just buy and don't trade. This can triple, or at least double sometime, in a single weeks time. Bull markets do come and my guess is that we are in the first 3 months of a brand new ten year "bull cycle" right about now. I know that everyone is talking drop but it will simply not happen this time as there is too much liquidity floating around. It's going to take ten years for this massive amount of liquidity to finally start to vaporize. Then the same sort of crash, like the one of of 1929, will finally come and Ben will be powerless to do anything about it. But America will recover, similarly to, as it did way back then. Happy investing to you!

It's like buying a plane and nobody knows how to fly it!!! But per OBIMBO - we are right on schedule - yep - losing jobs left and right, shutting manufacturing down, importing more then exporting and on and on! The Physicians are screaming mad about this #$%$ Obimbocare, which nobody knows how to implement, execute and maintain. Not even the senat themself and they now DON"T like it all the sudden???

With the markets at all time highs thanks to Obama's lousy economy which has forced Bernanke to keep the printing pressing rolling @ the clip of 85 billion a month, the rich seem to be the ones on the winning end of this administrations redistribution policy. The poor get Obama phones and the rich get Obama Gulfstream jets, while the folks in the middle get the shaft. Wealthy, not middle class, support Obama President Obama's approval numbers are starting to mimic Mitt Romney's. According to a new Economist/YouGov poll, it's the rich -- not the poor or middle class -- who back Obama more despite his 2012 campaign attacking the rich. The poll found that fewer than half of those with incomes less than $100,000 per year approve of Obama's performance, while he enjoys a 54 percent approval rating among those with incomes higher than that. Those earning less than $40,000 a year disapprove of the president's performance, 51 percent to 45 percent. Those earning $40,000 to $100,000 disapprove by a rate of 50 percent to 48 percent. "A largely jobless recovery coupled with a Quantitative-Easing-fueled stock market rally seems to earn more smiles from the upscale among us, fewer from the working class," said the pollsters.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1367530212489</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 17:30:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367530936608-22</Id><Topic><Title>Right Wing Maroons Say Nothing About Gas Prices</Title><Username>anotherwingnutloser</Username><Timestamp>1367462857529</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 22:47:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right wing "maroons" .
