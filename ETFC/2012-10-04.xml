Before the debate, Romney was behind among white women, even senior women, due to health care and entitlement issues. Obama agreed Romney's changes to Medicare only affected 55 and younger Pilgrims. Actually, it only allows Medicate to grow at GDP +0.5% [currently 1.3% + 0.5% = 1.8%], while Medicare costs are growing at 11.1%. Guess who eats the 9.3%, huh? Anybuddy? Ans: Current seniors. In 8 years, current seniors will be paying for 2/3 of their Medicare costs, a fact Obama was uninformed by his stupid Harvard handlers.

Too long, in fact. But there is no time like the present. Schwab and AMTD and Scottrade would love to pick off ETRADE, but there are also a host of other financials that are poised to offer an even high price. Firstly, an existing bank can take on the loans in a blink. After all, they are in the business and can jam another $10B of loans into their backroom. But most importantly, they would capture the best retail brokerage platform in the world and be willing to pay for it. This offers a massive opportunity on DAY 1 to start generating fees as well as complementing their existing wealth management businesses. A nationally oriented bank would also capture many more millions of clients an perhaps double down on how much of a clients wallet is with their institution. DTA is money in the bank for a buyer already paying taxes. Almost one billion in tax savings on day one. What more could a Bank ask for? Two ways to think about this: its either worthwhile for a brokerage buyer due to low darts and the need to consolidate, or it is easy entrance into a fee business for a well established bank. The MTM hit on the loan book is minimal at this point, once the parties start talking about true enterprise value, and not the facade PPS we have, the MTM adjustment will be acceptable. What this deal needs is a motivated selling agent. At this point, I do not see one one the job.</Msg><Username>maynardkrabs</Username><Timestamp>1349359218234</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 10:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349360415776-19</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Vs.

The word was probably out at the time of the first CEO search: "ETFC will be on the block, so don't go there". Well Maynard, the word is still out. Logic dictates a sale of ETRADE in the near future, for all of the reasons you mention in your recent posts. Perhaps the main reason for the event not taking place is that buyers have been conditioned to buy assets on the cheap. It rather difficult to convince the governing board of an acquiring institution that they should pay top dollar for assets when they have been paying peanuts for the last five years. I will say this. If these dikkhedds on the Etrade Board don't get off their azzzzes quick, there will be an expose'.

That creates about 4 million jobs”. Romney’s plan for “energy independence” actually relies heavily on a study that assumes the U.S. continues with fuel efficiency standards set by the Obama administration. For instance, he uses Citigroup research based off the assumption that “‘the United States will continue with strict fuel economy standards that will lower its oil demand.” Since he promises to undo the Obama administration’s new fuel efficiency standards, he would cut oil consumption savings of 2 million barrels per day by 2025. 2) “I don’t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don’t have a tax cut of a scale that you’re talking about.” A Tax Policy Center analysis of Romney’s proposal for a 20 percent across-the-board tax cut in all federal income tax rates, eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax, eliminating the estate tax and other tax reductions, would reduce federal revenue $480 billion in 2015. This amount to $5 trillion over the decade. 3) “My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I’m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people.” If Romney hopes to provide tax relief to the middle class, then his $5 trillion tax cut would add to the deficit. There are not enough deductions in the tax corde that primarily benefit rich people to make his math work. 4) “My — my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.” As the Tax Policy Center concluded, Romney’s plan can’t both exempt middle class families from tax cuts and remain revenue neutral. “He’s promised all these things and he can’t do them all. In order for him to cover the cost of his tax cut without adding to the deficit, he’d have to find a way to raise taxes on middle income people or people making less than $200,000 a year,” the Center found. 5) “I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it’s completely wrong.” The studies Romney cites actually further prove that Romney would, in fact, have to raise taxes on the middle class if he were to keep his promise not to lose revenue with his tax rate reduction. 6) “I saw a study that came out today that said you’re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.” Romney is pointing to this study from the American Enterprise Institute. It actually found that rather than raise taxes to pay down the debt, the Obama administration’s policies — those contained directly in his budget — would reduce the share of taxes that go toward servicing the debt by $1,289.89 per taxpayer in the $100,000 to $200,000 range. 7) “And the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America’s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate….97 percent of the businesses are not — not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they’re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half — half of all the people who work in small business.” Far less than half of the people affected by the expiration of the upper income tax cuts get any of their income at all from a small businesses. And those people could very well be receiving speaking fees or book royalties, which qualify as “small business income” but don’t have a direct impact on job creation. It’s actually hard to find a small business who think that they will be hurt if the marginal tax rate on income earned above $250,000 per year is increased. 8) “Mr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half.” Oil production from federal lands is higher, not lower: Production from federal lands is up slightly in 2011 when compared to 2007. And the oil and gas industry is sitting on 7,000 approved permits to drill, that it hasn’t begun exploring or developing. 9) “The president’s put it in place as much public debt — almost as much debt held by the public as all prior presidents combined.” This is not even close to being true. When Obama took office, the national debt stood at $10.626 trillion. Now the national debt is over $16 trillion. That $5.374 trillion increase is nowhere near as much debt as all the other presidents combined. 10) “That’s why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don’t want to kill jobs in this environment.” That study, produced by a right-wing advocacy organization, doesn’t analyze what Obama has actually proposed. 11) “What we do have right now is a setting where I’d like to bring money from overseas back to this country.” Romney’s plan to shift the country to a territorial tax system would allow corporations to do business and make profits overseas without ever being taxed on it in the United States. This encourages American companies to invest abroad and could cost the country up to 800,000 jobs. 12) “I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you’re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you’re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.” Sending federal Medicaid funding to the states in the form of a block grant woud significantly reduce federal spending for Medicaid because the grant would not keep up with projected health care costs. A CBO estimate of a very similar proposal from Paul Ryan found that federal spending would be “35 percent lower in 2022 and 49 percent lower in 2030 than current projected federal spending” and as a result “states would face significant challenges in achieving sufficient cost savings through efficiencies to mitigate the loss of federal funding.” “To maintain current service levels in the Medicaid program, states would probably need to consider additional changes, such as reducing their spending on other programs or raising additional revenues,” the CBO found. 13) “I want to take that $716 billion you’ve cut and put it back into Medicare…. But the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake. There’s that number again. Romney is claiming that Obamacare siphons off $716 billion from Medicare, to the detriment of beneficiaries. In actuality, that money is saved primarily through reducing over-payments to insurance companies under Medicare Advantage, not payments to beneficiaries. Paul Ryan’s budget plan keeps those same cuts, but directs them toward tax cuts for the rich and deficit reduction. 14) “What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare.” Here is how Romney’s Medicare plan will affect current seniors: 1) by repealing Obamacare, the 16 million seniors receiving preventive benefits without deductibles or co-pays and are saving $3.9 billion on prescription drugs will see a cost increase, 2) “premium support” will increase premiums for existing beneficiaries as private insurers lure healthier seniors out of the traditional Medicare program, 3) Romney/Ryan would also lower Medicaid spending significantly beginning next year, shifting federal spending to states and beneficiaries, and increasing costs for the 9 million Medicare recipients who are dependent on Medicaid. 15) “Number two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice. They get to choose — and they’ll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them.” The Medicare program changes for everyone, even people who choose to remain in the traditional fee-for-service. Rather than relying on a guaranteed benefit, all beneficiaries will receive a premium support credit of $7,500 on average in 2023 to purchase coverage in traditional Medicare or private insurance. But that amount will only grow at a rate of GDP plus 1.5 percentage points and will not keep up with health care costs. So while the federal government will spend less on the program, seniors will pay more in premiums. 16) “And, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or — or Senator Wyden, who’s the co-author of the bill with — with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill — Bill Clinton’s chief of staff.” Romney has rejected the Ryan/Wyden approach — which does not cap the growth of the “premium support” subsidy. Bill Clinton and his commission also voted down these changes to the Medicare program. 17) “Well, I would repeal and replace it. We’re not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world.” Romney has previously called for full repeal of Dodd-Frank, a law whose specific purpose is to regulate banks. MF Global’s use of customer funds to pay for its own trading losses is just one bit of proof that the financial industry isn’t responsible enough to protect consumers without regulation. 18) “But I wouldn’t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That’s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank… We need to get rid of that provision because it’s killing regional and small banks. They’re getting hurt.” The law merely says that the biggest, systemically risky banks need to abide by more stringent regulations. If those banks fail, they will be unwound by a new process in the Dodd-Frank law that protects taxpayers from having to pony up for a bailout. 19) “And, unfortunately, when — when — when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it’s adding to cost.” Obamacare will actually provide millions of families with tax credits to make health care more affordable. 20) “[I]t puts in place an unelected board that’s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don’t like that idea.” The Board, or IPAB is tasked with making binding recommendations to Congress for lowering health care spending, should Medicare costs exceed a target growth rate. Congress can accept the savings proposal or implement its own ideas through a super majority. The panel’s plan will modify payments to providers but it cannot “include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums…increase Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and co- payments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria” (Section 3403 of the ACA). Relying on health care experts rather than politicians to control health care costs has previously attracted bipartisan support and even Ryan himself proposed two IPAB-like structures in a 2009 health plan. 21) “Right now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.” The Affordable Care Act would actually expand health care coverage to 30 million Americans, despite Romney fear mongering. According to CBO director Douglas Elmendorf, 3 million or less people would leave employer-sponsored health insurance coverage as a result of the law. 22) “I like the way we did it [health care] in Massachusetts…What were some differences? We didn’t raise taxes.” Romney raised fees, but he can claim that he didn’t increase taxes because the federal government funded almost half of his reforms. 23) “It’s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had — had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside.” The Affordable Care Act incorporates many Republican ideas including the individual mandate, state-based health care exchanges, high-risk insurance pools, and modified provisions that allow insurers to sell policies in multiple states. Republicans never offered a united bipartisan alternative. 24) “Preexisting conditions are covered under my plan.” Only people who are continuously insured would not be discriminated against because they suffer from pre-existing conditions. This protection would not be extended to people who are currently uninsured. 25) “In one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that’s about 50 years’ worth of what oil and gas receives.” The $90 billion was given out over several years and included loans, loan guarantees and grants through the American Recovery Act. $23 billion of the $90 billion “went toward “clean coal,” energy-efficiency upgrades, updating the electricity grid and environmental clean-up, largely for old nuclear weapons sites.” 26) “I think about half of [the green firms Obama invested in], of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.” As of late last year, only “three out of the 26 recipients of 1705 loan guarantees have filed for bankruptcy, with losses estimated at just over $600 million.” 27) “If the president’s reelected you’ll see dramatic cuts to our military.” Romney is referring to the sequester, which his running mate Paul Ryan supported. Obama opposes the military cuts and has asked Congress to formulate a balanced approach that would avoid the trigger.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349362198184</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 10:49:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349362270516-26</Id><Title>Will ETFC Benefit From JPM CHASE Being Sued by the Feds???</Title><Msg>Long ago they bought a bunch of TOXIC CHIT from JPM.....

Ted Deutch (D-FL) Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) In the wake of revelations that Strategic Allied Consulting, a controversial voter registration firm that has worked for the Republican National Committee, the Florida Republican Party, and the Romney campaign, is under investigation for turning in fraudulent voter registration forms in Florida, a Florida Congressman is calling for a bipartisan probe. Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL) wrote Monday in a letter to Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R): In light of the large and apparently growing voter fraud scandal engulfing the Republican Party of Florida, I urge you to immediately appoint a bipartisan task force to investigate the accusations and ensure that the integrity of our voting rolls will not be compromised by Strategic Allied Consulting’s deliberately fraudulent voter registration operations. I also urge you to ensure that that false registrations submitted by Strategic Allied Consulting do not remain on our rolls, and that you immediately investigative whether any employees involved in this scandal are still working for the Republican Party to register voters in Florida. Deutch observes that Scott’s silence and inaction on the scandal, to date, are “shocking and hypocritical” in light of Scott’s Ahab-like attempts to purge suspected non-citizen voters from the state’s voting rolls. Scott has expressed a great deal of concern about potential voter fraud in Florida elections — even though state records indicate show Floridians are more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit voter fraud. But voter registration fraud apparently does exist in Florida. Scott signed an unconstitutional 2011 suppression law which put major new restrictions on groups who work to register new voters, requiring third-party voter registration groups like Strategic Allied Consulting to turn in completed registration forms 48 hours — to the minute — after completion, or face fines. Scott’s communications office did not immediately have any comment on the letter or the scandal.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349363973499</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 11:19:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349364717055-31</Id><Topic><Title>Etrade Board of Directors Needs to Wake Up and Sell This Company</Title><Username>maynardkrabs</Username><Timestamp>1349359218234</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 10:00:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Doubtful on the $2B debt write-down.

The total fair value adjustment is $1.1B on 1st liens AND helocs. The high priced corporate debt is under $1B - the company has enough cash and investments to pay them off - its a question of upstreaming captial - but that does not matter in a sale of the company.

Obama, however, wants to return taxes to Clinton-era rates for individuals who make more than $200,000 in annual taxable income and families who make more than $250,000 in taxable income.

The key factor is not changes in policy, but changes in drilling technology that have let America increase oil production faster than any other nation in the world in the past four years, Citigroup said. Declining crude oil imports, and more exports of natural gas and refined oil products, could reduce the trade deficit by as much as 40(PERCENT), adding 1(PERCENT) a year to economic growth, Moody’s Analytics estimates.

This is a myth advanced repeatedly by critics of the Affordable Care Act and debunked consistently by independent fact-checkers. The board – known as the Independent Payment Advisory Board – was set up to recommend ways to reduce Medicare spending if it increases too rapidly. The panel of independent experts is empowered to suggest cuts to how much the federal government pays healthcare providers. These cuts would go into effect unless Congress votes to overturn them.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349373069376</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:51:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349373313382-57</Id><Topic><Title>Gop is relieved Mitts didn't have a bonehead Perry lapse</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1349371337408</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:22:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rumney took the mitts off and boxed the encumbents ears.

New Mexico has started its own voter purge of 177,000 people, including a voting rights activist married to a state representative. However, as the law won’t go into effect until November 2014, the local Republican Party has apparently started training “poll challengers” for this election. A hidden camera caught Pat Morlen, the vice chair of the Sandoval County Republican Party, instructing volunteer “poll challengers” to demand photo ID and force legal voters to use provisional ballots. The video, filmed by the nonprofit ProgressNow New Mexico, shows vice-chair Morlen making several claims that directly contradict New Mexico law: MORLEN: You can request to see a form of ID. At the request of two or more precinct board members of different political parties, a voter shall still present the required physical form of identification. VOLUNTEER: What happens if we get people in there who are part of what the media is calling the purge? MORLEN: They’ll vote provisional. That’s all that’s gonna happen. Watch it: In spite of these false instructions, New Mexicans who were flagged as “inactive” voters are still permitted to vote with regular ballots in November. The misinformation didn’t stop there. ProgressNow compiled an extensive list of the lies presented as election law, including claims that Spanish speakers are not permitted interpreters and that the police are involved in election monitoring: CLAIM: “The police are supposed to be the ones who ensure that the election is legit.” FACT: Elections officials preside over elections, not the police. FACT: Police can be enlisted to ensure the orderly conduct of an election but officers who interfere with an election are guilty of a petty misdemeanor. CLAIM: The trainer claims a person who changed their address but stayed within their same voting precinct should receive a provisional ballot. FACT: Anyone in this situation is given a regular ballot at the polls. (See 1 NMAC 10.3) CLAIM: The trainer claims that interpreters are not provided to non-English speakers and then is unsure if polling places will provide Spanish-language ballots. FACT: Assistance for people in language minorities is provided, as are Spanish-language ballots. Morlen also disparaged disabled New Mexicans, opining, “if the person can’t even say their name, at least their name, I don’t see why they should be voting.” Obama has a narrow lead over Romney in the New Mexico polls, projecting a very close race. This particular training was filmed just two days after a study was released estimating 10 million Latinos could be disenfranchised by various voter suppression efforts. While Morlen’s statements are easily debunked, New Mexico voters are likely to be harassed and intimidated by these volunteer “voter challengers” armed with false information. But New Mexican voters aren’t the only targets; the national Tea Party group True the Vote has mobilized a large army of volunteers to go to the polls all over the country to harass voters. True the Vote tested out their voter intimidation skills during Gov. Scott Walker’s (R-WI) recall election in June, when poll watchers blocked students and African Americans from voting.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349374887530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:21:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349375154873-70</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo is STUPID!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349356960487</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 09:22:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo still trying to figure out Budget.

Todd Akin (R-MO) in the Missouri Senate race after the dropout deadline passed this week, have hit the fifth stage of grief: acceptance. After Akin declared last month that women cannot get pregnant from “legitimate rape” because “the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,” nearly every prominent Republican called on the Missouri Republican to drop out, including RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. When a reporter asked him at the Republican National Convention last month whether the party would support Akin even if he didn’t drop out, Priebus was unequivocal: “no, no, no.” REPORTER: If he stays in, is y’all’s position eventually going to change and you’re going to have to support him? PRIEBUS: No, no, no. He can be tied, we’re not gonna send him a penny. Watch it (beginning at 1:20): Today, after Akin stayed in the race and polls showing it tied, Priebus took a far different tone: Asked directly if he considered Akin to be a better option for Missouri voters than McCaskill, Priebus did not hesitate. “Well, absolutely,” he said in the interview. “That’s a given, and as chairman of the party, I have an obligation to make sure we win as many seats in the Senate as possible.” Akin again grabbed headlines this week when he told a reporter after a debate that Sen. McCaskill is not as “ladylike” as she was six years ago.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349376060730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:41:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349376402697-74</Id><Topic><Title>Romney lied about the ACA</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1349356020681</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 09:07:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>jeez pacifican, you are such a liar, AS with romneycare, the insurers are ALL for the ACA, good grief, they practically wrote it.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1349376402697</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:46:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349376557300-75</Id><Topic><Title>GOP reclaims Akin</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349376060730</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:41:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mo. Rep. Akin failed to report state pension Source: AP JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin on Thursday released a decade's worth of federal financial reports he has updated with nearly $130,000 in state pension income that he received, but failed to disclose, over that time. "This was an unintentional oversight and I regret any inconvenience this may cause," the Missouri congressman wrote in a letter dated Tuesday to the chairman of the House Ethics Committee. Akin's congressional office released copy of the updated reports Thursday after The Associated Press asked why he had not listed his retirement benefits. In his letter, Akin described the lack of information about his pension payments as a mistake that only recently came to his attention. Members of Congress are required to file annual reports listing their income and assets. The guidance book provided to lawmakers specifically states that they should list pension payments from any source other than the U.S. government.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349376557300</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:49:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349377101345-76</Id><Topic><Title>Etrade to Redeem 12 1/2% Notes on December 1, 2012</Title><Username>maynardkrabs</Username><Timestamp>1349374372620</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 14:12:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do they have a billion laying around somewhere?

The Obama administration's concern is well-founded. Earlier this month, both the Washington Post and New York Times documented the use of techniques including "code inflation" and "cloning" by some hospitals, clinics and physicians to extract overpayments from the government and private insurers alike for office visits, patient treatment and especially emergency room visits. According to one study from the Center for Public Integrity, the cost to U.S. taxpayers for Medicare overbilling reached $11 billion over the past decade. But in a less noticed twist, the story involves the dark nexus where presidential politics, the private equity industry and some of the leading lights of the Republican Party meet. As it turns out, HCA, one of the nation's largest for-profit hospital firms, is facing scrutiny for suspect billing practices, unnecessary procedures and questionable profit-taking that increased following its 2009 buyout by private equity firms including Mitt Romney's former firm, Bain Capital. If the name HCA sounds familiar, it should. Before the giant chain came to operate 163 hospitals nationwide, it was owned by the family of former Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. In the 1990's, the Hospital Corporation of America founded by Frist's father merged with Columbia Healthcare Corporation, a group then led by current Florida Governor Rick Scott. Scott was later forced off the board after HCA was forced to pay a staggering $1.7 billion penalty for Medicare fraud. For his part, in 2007 Doctor Frist was eventually cleared of insider trading involving his supposedly blind trust's sale of HCA stock. But now, the New York Times reports, HCA 's business practices are once again being viewed under the microscope. And as it turns out, the company's laser-focus on profit maximization followed its 2006 buyout by a group of private equity firms including Bain: In fact, profits at the health care industry giant HCA, which controls 163 hospitals from New Hampshire to California, have soared, far outpacing those of most of its competitors. The big winners have been three private equity firms -- including Bain Capital, co-founded by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate -- that bought HCA in late 2006. HCA's robust profit growth has raised the value of the firms' holdings to nearly three and a half times their initial investment in the $33 billion deal. The secret to HCA's success, now sadly a model for the entire industry, appears to be a formula that drains the U.S. Treasury and puts patients at greater risk. As the Times explained: It figured out how to get more revenue from private insurance companies, patients and Medicare by billing much more aggressively for its services than ever before; it found ways to reduce emergency room overcrowding and expenses; and it experimented with new ways to reduce the cost of its medical staff, a move that sometimes led to conflicts with doctors and nurses over concerns about patient care. Like other hospital groups that "cloned" patient records to collect payments from Medicare and other insurers for procedures and treatments not actually delivered, beginning in late 2008, "HCA changed the billing codes it assigned to sick and injured patients who came into the emergency rooms. Almost overnight, the numbers of patients who HCA said needed more care, which would be paid for at significantly higher levels by Medicare, surged." But at its facilities, HCA isn't merely gouging taxpayers. As the Times reported, lives are sometimes being jeopardized. Many doctors interviewed at various HCA facilities said they had felt increased pressure to focus on profits under the private equity ownership. "Their profits are going through the roof, but, unfortunately, it's occurring at the expense of patients," said Dr. Abraham Awwad, a kidney specialist in St. Petersburg, Fla., whose complaints over the safety of the dialysis programs at two HCA-owned hospitals prompted state investigations. One facility was fined $8,000 in 2008 and $14,000 last year for delaying the start of dialysis in patients, not administering physician-prescribed drugs and not documenting whether ordered tests had been performed. Even more serious, HCA's business practices surrounding cardiac care are being investigated by the Department of Justice. In the summer of 2010, a whistleblowing nurse named C.T. Thompson warned management that a doctor at his HCA hospital "had been performing heart procedures on patients who did not need them, putting their lives at risk." Those allegations were confirmed by an HCA ethics officer. And to be sure, they were harrowing: At Lawnwood, where an invasive diagnostic test known as a cardiac catheterization is performed, about half the procedures, or 1,200, were determined to have been done on patients without significant heart disease, according to a confidential 2010 review. HCA countered recently with a different analysis, saying the percentage of patients without disease was much lower and in keeping with national averages. At Bayonet Point, a 44-year-old man who arrived at the emergency room complaining of chest pain suffered a punctured blood vessel and a near-fatal irregular heartbeat after a doctor performed a procedure that an outside expert later suggested might have been unnecessary, documents show. The man had to be revived. "They shocked him twice and got him back," according to the testimony of Dr. Aaron Kugelmass in a medical hearing on the case. In another incident, an outside expert described how a woman with no significant heart disease went into cardiac arrest after a vessel was cut when a Bayonet Point cardiologist inserted a stent, a meshlike device that opens coronary arteries. She remained hospitalized for several days, according to a person who has reviewed internal reports. In his 2009 book The Buyout of America, author Josh Kosman documented the shocking tales of profit-maximization and cost-cutting at hospitals acquired in leveraged buyout deals by private equity firms. After saddling the hospitals with massive debt--including hundreds of millions of dollars in fees and dividend payments--PE firms would mandate slashing staff, trimming services and boosting prices to pay it off. As Mitt Romney explained in 1985, his Bain Capital would "invest in startup companies and ongoing companies, then to take an active hand in managing them and hopefully, five to eight years later, to harvest them at a significant profit." In the case of HCA, Bain and its PE partners are apparently harvesting significant profits from human beings: In 2010, buoyed by robust growth in profit, HCA was able to issue billions of dollars in debt that was used to pay funds overseen by the three buyout firms nearly $1 billion in dividends -- each. In the spring of 2011, in one of the most closely watched public offerings since the financial crisis, HCA became a public company once again. Its three buyout owners each sold another $500 million worth of stock, allowing them to recoup all their initial investment. Last fall, HCA agreed to buy back the stake held by Bank of America, which had purchased Merrill Lynch in 2009, for $1.5 billion, giving the bank a return of two and a half times its initial investment. And earlier this year, HCA paid out $900 million in dividends, of which $360 million went to K.K.R. and Bain. The 40 percent stake in HCA still held by K.K.R. and Bain is worth about $4.8 billion at current levels, giving them a potential profit, with the dividends they have received, of three and a half times their initial investment of $1.2 billion each. In Mitt Romney's defense, he left Bain Capital in 1999 (or 2002, depending on whether he's running for Governor of Massachusetts or President of the United States). But thanks to his one-of-a-kind, once-in-a-lifetime severance package, Romney continues to pocket millions annually from Bain's portfolio of investments. Whether Mitt Romney's ongoing windfall includes proceeds from HCA's billing shenanigans, bogus tests, unnecessary treatments and filled ER beds remains a mystery. (Perhaps the answer could be found by putting his tax returns under the microscope.) But at least for now, Bain and its PE partners will continue to get rich at the expense of American taxpayers--and Americans' health.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349382373921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 16:26:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349382685365-89</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo Lies and Lies (Bengahzi-Gate, Etc..)</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349372134640</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo's Racist rants, 'You Didn't Build That!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349382685365</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 16:31:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349382806311-90</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo Lies and Lies (Bengahzi-Gate, Etc..)</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349372134640</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>57 States!

George W. Bush Said The Same Thing By Travis Waldron on Oct 4, 2012 at 2:34 pm Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s tax plan would be a boon for the wealthiest Americans, a fact Romney himself admitted in GOP primary debates. Now, though, Romney has decided that cutting taxes for the rich isn’t what his plan will do, and he insists that he won’t support any tax plan — even his own, apparently — that provides the rich with a massive tax cut. “I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans,” Romney said in last night’s presidential debate. The last Republican president used a similar argument to sell his tax proposal when he was running for election. At a debate on October 3, 2000, George W. Bush made the exact same claim, telling debate moderator Jim Lehrer that once his tax plan became law, “the wealthiest of Americans” would “pay more taxes”: BUSH: Let me tell you what the facts are. The facts are, after my plan, the wealthiest of Americans pay more taxes on the percentage of the whole than they do today. Secondly, if you’re a family of four making $50,000 in Massachusetts, you get a 50% tax cut. Watch it: Bush’s tax cuts eventually became law, and as a result, the wealthy got a massive tax cut. In addition to rate cuts on income taxes, the Bush tax cuts included cuts to the capital gains rate and other investment taxes and an estate tax cut, all of which largely benefit the rich. The plan came at a cost of $2.5 trillion over its first decade. And while Bush was technically correct that the rich did “pay more taxes on the percentage of the whole,” that is “a useless measure of tax progressivity,” as Center for American Progress Director of Tax and Budget Policy Michael Linden has explained. The share of taxes paid by the wealthy grew by 25 percent under Bush, but their share of income grew by 30 percent, evidence that they actually got a massive tax cut. Bush’s promise, just like Romney’s, is a vague misdirection meant to distract from the overall tax cut he planned to provide. Romney’s plan, at a cost of nearly $5 trillion, is even bigger. And though Romney at least says he will cover some of the cost, the closure of loopholes wouldn’t offset the cuts for the rich, and to avoid adding to the deficit, he would have to raise taxes on the middle class. Romney relies on another similar argument Bush used, insisting that economic growth will offset the remaining costs. But the Bush tax cuts were followed by years of tepid job and economic growth that blew a massive hole in the federal budget and left Bush flailing when it came to his promise to pay off the national debt in a decade. A Republican National Committee spokesperson earlier this year said that Romney’s economic policies would be “Bush, just updated.” It turns out his arguments are too.

FRIEDMAN FOR the first time in a long, long time, a Democrat is running for president and has the clear advantage on national security policy. That is not “how things are supposed to be,” and Republicans sound apoplectic about it. But there is a reason President Obama is leading on national security, and it was apparent in his U.N. speech last week, which showed a president who understands that we really do live in a more complex world today — and that saying so is not a cop-out. It’s a road map. Mitt Romney, given his international business background, should understand this, but he acts instead as if he learned his foreign policy at the International House of Pancakes, where the menu and architecture rarely changes. Rather than really thinking afresh about the world, Romney has chosen instead to go with the same old G.O.P. bacon and eggs — that the Democrats are toothless wimps who won’t stand up to our foes or for our values, that the Republicans are tough and that it is 1989 all over again. That is, America stands astride the globe with unrivaled power to bend the world our way, and the only thing missing is a president with “will.” The only thing missing is a president who is ready to simultaneously confront Russia, bash China, tell Iraqis we’re not leaving their country, snub the Muslim world by outsourcing our Arab-Israel policy to the prime minister of Israel, green light Israel to bomb Iran — and raise the defense budget while cutting taxes and eliminating the deficit. It’s all “attitude” — without a hint at how we could possibly do all these contradictory things at once, or the simplest acknowledgment that two wars and a giant tax cut under George W. Bush has limited our ability to do even half of them. Let’s look at the world we’re actually living in. It is a world that has become much more interdependent so that our friends failing (like Greece) can now harm us as much as our enemies threatening, and our rivals (like China) collapsing can hurt us as much as their rising. It’s a world where a cheap YouTube video made by a superempowered individual can cause us more trouble than the million-dollar propaganda campaign of a superpower competitor. It is a globalized economy in which the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, America’s largest business lobby, has opposed Romney’s pledge to designate China as a currency manipulator and is pressing Congress to lift cold war trade restrictions on Russia, a country Romney has labeled America’s “No. 1 geopolitical foe.” It is a world where, at times, pulling back — and focusing on rebuilding our strength at home — is the most meaningful foreign policy initiative we can undertake because when America is at its best — its institutions, schools and values — it can inspire emulation, whereas Russia and China still have to rely on transactions or bullying to get others to follow. It is still a world where the use of force, or the threat of force, against implacable foes (Iran) is required, but a world where a nudge at the right time and place can also be effective. Add it all up and it’s a world in which America will have greater responsibility (because our European and Japanese allies are now economically enfeebled) and fewer resources (because we have to cut the defense budget) to manage a more complex set of actors (because so many of the states we have to deal with now are new democracies with power emanating from their people not just one man — like Egypt — or failing states like Pakistan) where our leverage on other major powers is limited (because Russia’s massive oil and gas income gives it great independence and any war we’d want to fight in Asia we’d have to borrow the money from China). This complexity doesn’t argue for isolationism. It argues for using our power judiciously and in a nuanced fashion. For instance, if you had listened to Romney criticizing Obama for weakness after the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, you’d have thought that, had Romney been president, he would have immediately ordered some counterstrike. But, had we done so, it would have aborted what was a much more meaningful response: Libyans themselves taking to the streets under the banner “Our Revolution Will Not Be Stolen” and storming the headquarters of the Islamist militias who killed the U.S. ambassador. It shows you how much this complexity can surprise you. The one area where Romney could have really challenged Obama on foreign policy was on the president’s bad decision to double-down on Afghanistan. But Romney can’t, because the Republican Party wanted to triple down. So we’re having no debate about how to extricate ourselves from our biggest foreign policy mess and a cartoon debate — “I’m tough; he’s not” — about everything else. In that sense, foreign policy is a lot like domestic policy. The morning after the election, we will face a huge “cliff”: how to deal with Afghanistan, Iran and Syria, without guidance from the candidates or a mandate from voters. Voters will have to go with their gut about which guy has the best gut feel for navigating this world. Obama has demonstrated that he has something there. Romney has not.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349397731875</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:42:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349401959970-124</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Makes Record Fundraising Haul !</Title><Username>mittins_da_wimpins</Username><Timestamp>1349395233146</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:00:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Was Obama rattled by developing donor scandal story?

According to knowlegable sources, a national magazine and a national web site are preparing a blockbuster donor scandal story. Sources told Secrets that the Obama campaign has been trying to block the story. But a key source said it plans to publish the story Friday or, more likely, Monday. According to the sources, a taxpayer watchdog group conducted a nine-month investigation into presidential and congressional fundraising and has uncovered thousands of cases of credit card solicitations and donations to Obama and Capitol Hill, allegedly from unsecure accounts, and many from overseas. That might be a violation of federal election laws. The Obama campaign has received hundreds of millions in small dollar donations, many via credit card donations through their website. On Thursday, the campaign announced a record September donor haul of $150 million. At the end of the 2008 presidential campaign, the Obama-Biden effort was hit with a similar scandal. At the time, the Washington Post reported that the Obama campaign let donors use "largely untraceable prepaid credit cards that could potentially be used to evade limits on how much an individual is legally allowed to give or to mask a contributor's identity."</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349401959970</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 21:52:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349402953093-125</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Makes Record Fundraising Haul !</Title><Username>mittins_da_wimpins</Username><Timestamp>1349395233146</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 20:00:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>slayer darling, You're not making any headwind!!!</Msg><Username>bami2012</Username><Timestamp>1349402953093</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 22:09:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349403771943-126</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo is STUPID!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349356960487</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 09:22:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>coward q4bike, Do you always live behind the moon?
