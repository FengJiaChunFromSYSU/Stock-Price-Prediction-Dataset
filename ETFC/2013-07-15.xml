This is justice in the deep south. TAMPA, Fla. -- Marissa Alexander had never been arrested before she fired a bullet at a wall one day in 2010 to scare off her husband when she felt he was threatening her. Nobody got hurt, but this month a northeast Florida judge was bound by state law to sentence her to 20 years in prison. Alexander, a 31-year-old mother of a toddler and 11-year-old twins, knew it was coming. She had claimed self-defense, tried to invoke Florida's "stand your ground" law and rejected plea deals that could have gotten her a much shorter sentence. A jury found her guilty as charged: aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Because she fired a gun while committing a felony, Florida's mandatory-minimum gun law dictated the 20-year sentence.</Msg><Username>slayerhomo98_1</Username><Timestamp>1373904039662</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 12:00:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373904627295-16</Id><Topic><Title>Oakland</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1373821558057</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 13:05:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>slayerdarling, Black leaders have asked for calm after the verdict and there have been no reports of riots, but people are protesting in the streets throughout this country.

The best advice for ETFC is to buy and do not look back. In 5-10 years you'll more than likely be up well over 1000-5000%. So, in other words, $1000 invested today will more than likely become $9000-$49,000 dollars in 5-10 years. You could lose the entire $1000. This is what investing in equities is all about. High risk can equal high reward. Anytime you buy equity in a company (the stock), you take a very big risk. What is even more risky is to not invest at all. Then there is a 100% chance that your money will lose diminish in value if you do not invest at all. Tip: Do not even look at your stocks everyday. One time per month is sufficient for the majority of investors, or at the very most one time per week.</Msg><Username>rogerdonna_1988</Username><Timestamp>1373916235977</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:23:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373917272457-33</Id><Topic><Title>will the bully hero zimmerman ever get a job?</Title><Username>manceridermunce</Username><Timestamp>1373895987487</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 09:46:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Conservative thing to do is to keep eyes open, consider all possible scenarios based on given information on all sides. Liberal thing to do is to pick and choose. Neglect any evidence which doesn't fit agenda. We went through all presented information about the case right on this MB. There is nothing there that undeniably fits your charge. There were 6 members of jury which were pressured by your liberal media to come to certain conclusion. They preferred to stay neutral. Kudos!!! Now, go back to 1995 of OJ Simpson trial where all evidence was on the table to put OJ on death row. Instead a true murderer went free. Were you upset by jury's decision than? I can tell, not as much as now, despite the fact you have an evidence of... NOTHING to support the charge.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1373917272457</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:41:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373918836839-34</Id><Title>Zimmerman and Cheney go hunting</Title><Msg>Zimmerman shoots cheney right off the bat and says " I knew he was going to shoot me in the face, so i shot him, so that's stand your ground, right?

I'm thinking now Zimmerman can be a judge. He knows when people are guilty just by looking at them. Heck, you could turn him loose in a crowd he would start stalking and getting hot and bothered and call the cops and then accost the " perp" and pull a gun. and kill them too, especially if nobody is looking.

"Remember she was a stripper and apparently a prostitute also who had the DNA of 5 black guys inside of her, none belonging to the white Lacrosse players. She made up the story because she was upset that they only gave her part of the money for stripping at the party because she decided to leave early when the guys started getting too rowdy, even for her. When she got caught drunk in someone else's car later that night and the police were about to arrest her, she made up the story to get out of trouble because she was already on probation".. The Prosecutor Nifong had to know it was a completely made up story, but since he was running for office in a mostly black district, he kept pushing the case to get votes. Sound familiar with the Zimmernan case, where politics got in the way of the truth. I am surprised Obama at the time didn't make the statement that she look like his daughters, as he did with Martin looking like his son.

EVER! This action can get you killed (and this time it certainly did). If the neighborhood watch guy asks you questions you DO NOT punch him in the nose. Trayvon Martin was wrong to be aggressive towards Zimmerman. Zimmerman was completely wrong in what he did too. Zimmerman now has to live with himself, for the rest of his life, for murdering some innocent black young person even though the court did rule in his favor. The parents of Trayvon should have taught him about the "A soft answer turneth away wrath" principle! This is the lesson to be learned by others, in the future, who are approached by someone crazy like George Zimmerman. I'm black and I know not to be aggressive when people who think they are in authority question me. Being agressive is simply NOT the answer people! Just walk away. "Keep on Truckin' " is what we'd say back in the 1970's! Why get shot by some idiot who has a gun? It might feel good at the moment but It's not worth your life!</Msg><Username>hotmanforahotwoman</Username><Timestamp>1373926173329</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 18:09:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373931112557-44</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmerman and the Duke La Crosse debacle</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1373920078344</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 16:27:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rush's little parrot is sqwauking again.
