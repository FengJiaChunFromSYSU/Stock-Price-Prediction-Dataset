Paul Ryan’s (R-WI) budget plan in the November election, this week’s unveiling of the latest House Republican budget shows that Rep. Ryan still doesn’t get it when it comes to standing with women and promoting the economic security of their families. The latest Ryan budget puts a tight cap on the area of the budget that funds vital supports for low-income girls and young adults, like nutrition assistance for expectant mothers and their children, child development, childcare, and education assistance. Adult women struggling to feed their families would see their food stamp (or SNAP) benefits cut. Changes to Medicaid would jeopardize women’s access to affordable health care and long-term care — making matters worse for women doing their best to care for themselves, their children, and their aging parents — and turning Medicare into a voucher program would shift costs onto senior women, jeopardizing their future economic security. Unfortunately, just as in past years, the former vice presidential candidate has put forth a budget that rewards the rich with a huge tax break while cutting off opportunity and pathways out of poverty for women at every critical juncture in their lives.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363357690294</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 10:28:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363358751602-8</Id><Title>Sen. Rob Portman comes out in favor of gay marriage after son comes out as gay</Title><Msg>Source: The Plain Dealer WASHINGTON, D.C. - Republican U.S. Sen. Rob Portman on Thursday announced he has reversed his longtime opposition to same-sex marriage after reconsidering the issue because his 21-year-old son, Will, is gay. Portman said his son, a junior at Yale University, told him and his wife, Jane, that he's gay and "it was not a choice, it was who he is and that he had been that way since he could remember." "It allowed me to think of this issue from a new perspective, and that's of a Dad who loves his son a lot and wants him to have the same opportunities that his brother and sister would have -- to have a relationship like Jane and I have had for over 26 years," Portman told reporters in an interview at his office. The conversation the Portmans had with their son two years ago led to him to evolve on the issue after he consulted clergy members, friends including former Vice President #$%$ Cheney, and the Bible.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363358751602</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 10:45:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363358882014-9</Id><Topic><Title>52 million volume...

It wasn't announced as an upcoming sale but rather as an announcement of an already executed divestiture at a fixed price. So this has all been, beyond that point (around $11.45) an exercise in FUD plus the effect of cascading stop loss orders adding to the above FUD. Call it a buying opportunity, grab as much as is reasonable to your strategy, and say thank you for the easy profits, as anything under $11 is a no brainer buy. Not a STRONG buy anymore, it would have had to drop far further, but a buy is almost as good even buying on margin. Note that NONE of this effected Citadel as they'd ALREADY sold their shares through the subscription offering.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1363371356723</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:15:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363372862531-27</Id><Title>OMG, the Bible sells</Title><Msg>**History channel, managed to attract more viewers than anything on broadcast network NBC** Come on, you lefties can tell us that you snuck a peek at the bible series...we won't tell. Blockbuster ratings for ‘The Bible’ confound Hollywood Sure, it’s easy to criticize Hollywood, but try to remember that the entertainment industry today is an intellectually demanding environment, fraught with cognitively challenging, even intractable, questions, like, to take one recent example: How can the cable mini-series “The Bible” be such a ratings hit when there is no audience for overtly religious entertainment programming? According to the latest Nielsens, released Tuesday, Sunday night’s telecast of “The Bible,” produced by husband-and-wife team Mark Burnett and Roma Downey for basic cable’s History channel, managed to attract more viewers than anything on broadcast network NBC … during the entire week. The second installment of this five-part mini-series airing at 8-10 p.m. Sundays through Easter — the first foray into scripted drama for “Survivor” creator Burnett — drew 10.8 million viewers, good for number one in its timeslot and number 11 overall for the week. Even bigger was part one the week before, which amassed an audience of 13.1 million viewers, cable’s largest of the year.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1363372862531</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:41:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363372959404-28</Id><Topic><Title>The real question is Why would Citadel announce it was going to sell?</Title><Username>is_matrix</Username><Timestamp>1363309447778</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 21:04:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>post facts not rumors. how do you know those were citadel shares? they have burned investors every time they could as far as etfc goes!!looking for low tens a coming !!! the best thing for etfc is getting rid of citadel for good!!!IMHO they suck</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363372959404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:42:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363373110523-29</Id><Topic><Title>52 million volume...

We SHOULD, however, be able to buy any weapon we have the training to use, and the ability to store, maintain, and secure. Further we should have the right to be able to GET training in any weapon we can afford to purchase. Out of the military the list of weapons I'm qualified to use is QUITE extensive, everything from a handgun up to main battle tank, and indeed you can buy main battle tanks, but they're TERRIBLY expensive to maintain and arm and keep in practice with but, if these stupid laws pass, it'll actually be easier to buy a functional assault gun in California than a handgun. There are no laws in California against NFA weapons you see. So while Joe, across the street, is upset he can't get high capacity mags for his AR-15, he's also irritated because there are very few places he can safely fire his anti-tank cannon. Think that's funny? The only reason I haven't bough Joe's Anti Tank Gun from him is I don't have the money to buy it. Even his itty bitty 57mm high velocity ATG with ammo and spare parts is $65,000. I suppose I could buy a new Bofors 57mm/ M110 cannon though alittle cheaper (without the power turret and other goodies, just with the land carriage), but it doesn't have the historical value.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1363374138581</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:02:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363374261553-35</Id><Topic><Title>The real question is Why would Citadel announce it was going to sell?</Title><Username>is_matrix</Username><Timestamp>1363309447778</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 21:04:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Citadel was required to disclose the sale to the SEC, because they were a greater than 5% holder, and because KG is on the BOD.</Msg><Username>gorakrishna</Username><Timestamp>1363374261553</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:04:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363374810828-36</Id><Title>if 10.70 is a good deal</Title><Msg>there is no way they would let you buy them!!!wait till they really sell it off!IMHO</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363374810828</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:13:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363374905406-37</Id><Topic><Title>citadel are pros</Title><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363373605928</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:53:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he is attracting quite a bit of attention to himself.</Msg><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1363374905406</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:15:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363375264155-38</Id><Title>can you say pump and dump?</Title><Msg>first they take it to 11.80 so you think its worth something .sell at a lower price then dump shares on you like there's no tomorrow. wake up people!!!IMHO where are the profits? never seem to materialize IMHO</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363375264155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:21:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363375459374-39</Id><Topic><Title>citadel are pros</Title><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363373605928</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:53:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually this move has cost Citidel the pimp 27 million, actually it should help ETFC to get rid of those pimps</Msg><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1363375459374</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:24:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363375552381-40</Id><Title>Tuesday price is set</Title><Msg>@ 11 bucs Citi del still o loses close to 27 million over the announcement, they have no clue</Msg><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1363375552381</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:25:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363375632163-41</Id><Topic><Title>Tuesday price is set</Title><Username>rkmtt</Username><Timestamp>1363375552381</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:25:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rumors again where is the facts to back up your story?faw IMHO</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363375632163</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:27:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363375752309-42</Id><Topic><Title>citadel are pros</Title><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363373605928</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 14:53:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>reminds me more of a Loanshark.</Msg><Username>buythisdog</Username><Timestamp>1363375752309</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 15:29:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363375801033-43</Id><Topic><Title>apparently pubs think "right of the people to keep and bear arms" means you have a right to a tank or a nuke or any 'arms' whatsoever</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1363299153841</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 18:12:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another guy looking through the world with rose colored glassed. Hey dude, if Automatic Weapons are "banned" why do I own a "registered conversion device" that I can use with a host receiver to have anything from an MP5SD to an HK 21E? e.g. I OWN a machine gun, and two silencers (one is an MP5SD so the suppressor is built in, the other is a Gemtech 57 for the FNH FiveseveN pistol), legally . . . and I could buy more if I had the funds. What the government DID in 1986 (not that long ago) was freeze the NUMBER of fully automatic weapons in civilian hands by allowing no new builds to be registered, effectively closing for now a generational gap in the ownership of those weapons as well as a wealth gap. E.g. only those who already had them or those with enough money can afford them now, and the SMG I bought in the 90's for $6,500 in now worth north of $30,000 just because the people who can legally OWN automatic weapons have become what literally amounts to a privileged class. What I'm looking forward to is moving the trigger pack to my HK53 receiver. That give me a weapon about 16" long with full automatic fire, and either a 100 round drum. 40+round banana mags, or 30 or 20 round mags depending on the need for concealment. With the 100 round drums it makes for one of the most compact light machine guns in existence, and with stick magazines, an assault rifle shorter and more maneuverable than the current HK G36. Oh yeah, I also have a host receivers to convert to a full up HK G3 and G33 [7.62mm NATO and 5.56mm NATO) (cold war) predecessors to the G36. I haven't done it yet because I have to learn how to repack the trigger pack so that I get the proper rate of fire and proper assembly for all three calibers, and I don't have a range in my back yard here in Grapevine the way I do in Simms. So, perfect record still, wrong again . . . . wanna go for best outta, what is it now, 513?

This golfer-president could start doing something 4 years ago to plug the hole, we would be in way better financial shape today. But he was busy playing games with raising taxes on millionaires and billionaires and pushing through legislation that majority of the country didn't and still doesn't want. Dirty little secret that uneducated public including you don't know is, tax increase and closing tax loopholes never close the deficit gap. Never will. - We had already a budget proposal from this golfer-president, and it was rejected by 98% of his own Senate. - Yesterday, Democrats came out with another budget plan which doesn't balance the budget either. Ryan's plan is all focusing on balancing budget. If we don't, this country is going to financial collapse, not only our children will see that, but it is going to happen in my time. President explicitly said he doesn't want to balance budget. Of course, not. His proposed tax policies are incapable to do that. So, just keep accumulating debt and convincing uneducated idiots they have nothing to worry about. What if banks around the world will find a better place to invest than US? What if banks around the world will raise interest rates for new debt? Your LOL sounds like #$%$ cursing.

GIVES HUGE TAX CUTS TO THE RICH AND CORPORATIONS: Ryan’s plan would reduce both top income and corporate tax rates to 25 percent, resulting in trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. The government would lose roughly $7 trillion in revenues compared to Ryan’s projections, and while he plans to close loopholes to pay for the cuts, he has in the past failed to specify which loopholes he would close, and raising enough revenue from the elimination of tax expenditures would prove politically difficult, if not impossible. Ryan would also convert the corporate tax code to an “international” plan, resulting in an even bigger giveaway to American companies that are already paying historically low tax rates. 2. FORCES SENIORS TO PAY MORE FOR HEALTH CARE: Beginning 2024, the guaranteed Medicare benefit would be transformed into a government-financed “premium support” system. Seniors currently under the age of 55 could use their government contribution to purchase insurance from an exchange of private plans or traditional fee-for-service Medicare. But the budget does not take sufficient precautions to prevent insurers from cherry-picking the the healthiest beneficiaries from traditional Medicare and leaving sicker applicants to the government. As a result, traditional Medicare costs could skyrocket, forcing even more seniors out of the government program. The budget also adopts a per capita cost cap of GDP growth plus 0.5 percent, without specifying how it would enforce it. This makes it likely that the cap would limit the government contribution provided to beneficiaries.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363379805351</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 16:36:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363379864250-56</Id><Topic><Title>Worst things about Ryan’s budget:</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363379805351</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 16:36:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>3. JEOPARDIZES MEDICAID: The budget would eliminate the exiting matching-grant financing structure of Medicaid and would instead give each state a pre-determined block grant that does not keep up with actual health care spending. This would shift some of the burden of Medicaid’s growing costs to the states, forcing them to — in the words of the CBO — make cutbacks that “involve reduced eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP, coverage of fewer services, lower payments to providers, or increased cost sharing by beneficiaries—all of which would reduce access to care.” 4. REPEALS HEALTH COVERAGE FROM 30 MILLION AMERICANS: The budget repeals the Affordable Care Act’s requirement to purchase health insurance coverage, the establishment of health insurance exchanges, the provision of subsidies for lower-income Americans, the expansion of the Medicaid program, and tax credits for small businesses that provide insurance coverage. As a result, more than 30 million Americans would lose coverage and the budget would eliminate the new law’s consumer protections, which have already benefited tens of millions of Americans. States across the country are already implementing the law and a growing number of Republican governors have finally agreed to expand their Medicaid programs. 5. CUTS FOOD STAMPS: The budget seeks to turn most social safety net programs into block grants to the states that are modeled after the 1996 welfare reform law. That would result in devastating cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps), women, infant, and children programs, and other parts of the social safety net that keep millions of people out of poverty each year. Since welfare reform occurred 16 years ago, it has failed to reach many families with children in poverty, particularly during the latest economic recession. Ryan’s budget would make most safety programs equally as impotent.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363379864250</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 16:37:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363379962190-57</Id><Topic><Title>"Protecting" his family</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363359072095</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 10:51:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just have to add one thing - no matter what gun one has - here are my rules! 1.

Bush launched 10 years ago. The report also found that American taxpayers will ultimately spend roughly $2.2 trillion on the war, but because the U.S. government borrowed to finance the conflict, interest payments through the year 2053 means that the total bill could reach nearly $4 trillion. “Nearly every government that goes to war underestimates its duration, neglects to tally all the costs, and overestimates the political objectives that will be accomplished by war’s violence,” said Boston University professor of political science and project co-director Neta C. Crawford. Indeed, the war devastated the Iraqi health care system and allowed militants to hone their skills and export them to neighboring conflicts: Terrorism in Iraq increased dramatically as a result of the invasion and tactics and fighters were exported to Syria and other neighboring countries. Iraq’s health care infrastructure remains devastated from sanctions and war. More than half of Iraq’s medical doctors left the country during the 2000s, and tens of thousands of Iraqi patients are forced to seek health care outside the country.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363391581182</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 19:53:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363391642962-71</Id><Topic><Title>Bush should be jailed</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363391581182</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 19:53:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Watson Institute project — which involves “30 economists, anthropologists, lawyers, humanitarian personnel, and political scientists from 15 universities, the United Nations, and other organizations” — comes on the heals of the Special Inspector-General for Iraq Reconstruction’s final report released last week finding that the U.S. spent $60 billion on reconstruction efforts in Iraq and that $10 billion of it was wasted on fraud and abuse. Reuters reported that Steven Bucci, the military assistant to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in the run-up to the war and today a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, didn’t dispute the report’s findings but said the U.S.’s post-invasion battles with al-Qaeda in Iraq — a group that did not exist prior to March 19, 2003 — made the war worth it. “It was really in Iraq that ‘al Qaeda central’ died,” Bucci said. “They got waxed.” Meanwhile, the AP reported this afternoon that “a string of explosions tore through central Baghdad within minutes of each other on Thursday, followed by what appeared to be a coordinated assault by gunmen who battled security forces in the Iraqi capital.” The AP said the attack — which reportedly killed 12 people — “bore the hallmarks of Al Qaeda’s Iraq arm.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363391642962</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 19:54:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363393292268-72</Id><Title>We have proven that Obama does not create jobs</Title><Msg>Perhaps, the pukes were right along.

The gay Republican was referring to GOProud’s exclusion from participation at CPAC for a second year in a row, banned as an official sponsor. LaSalvia attended CPAC as a guest of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a sponsor of CPAC which hosted a panel Thursday on which LaSaliva appeared, “A Rainbow on the Right: Growing the Coalition, Bringing Tolerance Out of the Closet.” At the packed panel, attended by younger CPAC members, including quite a few conservative gays and lesbians, conservative commentators and activists on the panel who support marriage equality, including CNN pundit Margaret Hoover and Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, made the case for gay marriage as conservative value. Earlier in the day Senator Marco Rubio, criticized those who would call him a “bigot” for not supporting same-sex marriage, underscoring the tension the issue continues to cause among conservatives. LaSalvia, for his part, however, agreed with Rubio, making a similar statement during the panel discussion and getting applause from the audience. (Scroll down to listen to the full interview) “It’s truly about what people think conservatives think of gay people,” LaSalvia said in an interview on my SiriusXM radio program. “Kicking us out of CPAC doesn’t help. People aren’t going to vote for you if they think you hate their family and friends.” “How do we have a winning coalition in the future, in a world that has gay people in every single family,” LaSalvia continued, a day before GOP Senator Rob Portman reversed his position and came out for marriage equality because his son had come out as gay. “It’s broader than marriage equality.

This was a pre-planned mass placement at around that price, probably based on the closing price or average price at some other point this week.

But it’s more likely the cancellation actually made his trip, if not his year. What the “we report, you decide” network didn’t mention is that he’s a Republican activist who was also taking part in CPAC. The fact that Glasscock thanked the show for having him on and was given a chance to rattle off his anti-Obama talking points suggested the whole thing was more of a boon than a bust. So did his Twitter feed. Although nobody on the show mentioned Glasscock’s partisan activities, it’s quite unlikely they didn’t know: Glasscock was profiled late last summer by Fox News when he worked as a page at the Republican National Convention. He told FNC’s Todd Starnes, “Basically the main job of a page is to rally the base and show people that, not only the Republican party, but the youth is excited about the Romney/Ryan ticket.” He also noted that while this was the first election in which he could vote, “I’ve been involved in campaigns before.” Glasscock lists his other Republican activities on his blog, which also includes his satiric poem, "The Night Before Barackmas." And oh, look! Starnes enthused about Glassock's upcoming Fox appearance in a tweet, too. Given Fox’s over-the-top fixation on White House tours (and its blind eye to how the sequester cuts are threatening programs in housing assistance, early childhood education, disaster relief, and national security.), Glasscock may well have seen this whole episode as another opportunity to rally young people for the GOP.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363394591187</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 20:43:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363394617238-77</Id><Topic><Title>Oh yeah, that's fair and balanced!!</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363394591187</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 20:43:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So it's hard to believe Steve Doocy was anything but disingenuous when he introduced Glasscock by saying, "He is a high school student from Wichita, Kansas who was looking forward to touring the White House on Tueday." Or when he prompted asked Glasscock, "I understand you blame the president of the United States here. You say he’s being petty in closing down the White House tours." Glasscock had his GOP talking points down. He even worked in Benghazi: Yes, sir. Even though he doesn’t blame himself, I think the blame relies on him. It seems like he’s a president who doesn’t want to take responsibility for anything. First, he blames Benghazi on the State Department and then White House tours on his Secret Service, so what happened to "The buck stops here?” Yeah!” Doocy exclaimed. Later, after probing Glasscocks's thoughts on what “other areas of White House spending should be cut instead,” Doocy asked him, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" "I don’t know," Glasscock said. "I’m looking down the business road but wherever God calls me, I’ll gladly go." Well, if God is calling him to Fox News, the kid certainly aced his first interview."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363394617238</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 20:43:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363395298886-78</Id><Title>HEY JB!....It Hits Real People Too!...</Title><Msg>My 14yr. old daughter is going on a School Trip to the Hell Hole (Washington) in a month...

Oh, and he hates austerity, too. But Francis also seems to be an opponent of austerity, most notably during his time as spiritual leader of Argentina when the country defaulted on its debt in 2002. A paper by Thomas Trebat, “Argentina, the Church, and Debt,” details the church’s role in the crisis’s resolution. Argentine bishops, including Francis, had long criticized the laissez-faire policies of Carlos Menem, who was president from 1989 to 1999. “The bishops were critical of the economic model as a generator of poverty and unemployment, notwithstanding the stability it had brought to the country,” Trebat wrote. Looking forward to John Boehner, Paul Ryan and all the other Republican Catholics in this country to abandon their tax cuts for the rich/screw the poor economics, and embrace Pope Francis' teachings."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363400886884</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 22:28:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363403888874-83</Id><Topic><Title>“I’m embarrassed to call myself a Republican right now,”</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363393717389</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 20:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What took him so long ?</Msg><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1363403888874</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 23:18:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363404006847-84</Id><Topic><Title>We have proven that Obama does not create jobs</Title><Username>amorano_123</Username><Timestamp>1363393292268</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 20:21:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Corporate profits at all time high.
