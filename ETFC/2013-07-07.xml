The trick to being a successful short isn't necessarily the ability to find potential failure and capitalize on it, but to TIME the stock movements created therein, and to avoid situations where the company may be able to bail itself our or be a desirable takeover target for others. By BOTH those qualifications eTrade is a bad bed. so the only shorts you'll see in this stock are outright amateurs who'll lose their stake within a relatively short time, particularly if they short with derivatives.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1373215112324</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 12:38:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373239227401-4</Id><Topic><Title>Independence Day.

Doesn't look like it. No matter what president's relationship to golf is, they do not collect dots, and may act only upon solidly confirmed input data. CIA and FBI both failed miserably to do their prevention part prior to 9/11. Both agencies were built by W's predecessor, B.J. Clinton (9/11 happened less than 8 months after W took office). Knowledge about terrorism and its operatives is immensely larger than pre-9/11. But under this president we had at least 3 instances (Fort Hood, Benghazi, Boston marathon) when you have to wonder if our policy establishing officials learned anything. We are back to direct negotiations with Taliban. That’s leadership? Nope. Obama learned nothing yet.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1373239227401</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 19:20:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373246194957-5</Id><Title>GOP assault on women will have consequences</Title><Msg>11-Year-Old Chilean Rape Victim’s Health Is In Danger Because She Can’t Get An Abortion By Tara Culp-Ressler on Jul 7, 2013 at 10:33 am An 11-year-old Chilean girl who has become pregnant from rape is renewing a contentious debate over abortion in the conservative Catholic country, where the medical procedure is illegal under all circumstances. Doctors have warned that continuing the pregnancy will be dangerous for the 11-year-old’s health, as well as for the health of her fetus. But, under Chile’s total abortion ban, she is forced to continue it anyway. The young girl is now 14 weeks pregnant. Her mother’s boyfriend has confessed to sexually abusing the child over the past two years, and is now in custody. Abortion was legal in Chile under some medical circumstances until Gen. Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship instated a total ban in 1973. The current conservative administration has remained firmly opposed to loosening the harsh ban. According to the Santiago Times, Chile is now one of just six countries in the world — including Vatican City — with such stringent anti-abortion laws. But now that the 11-year-old’s case has been made public, Chileans are beginning to push for change. Some opponents have started an online petition to demand legal abortion access in cases when the woman has been raped or when the woman’s health is at risk.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1373246194957</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 21:16:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373250232267-6</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on women will have consequences</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1373246194957</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 21:16:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Source: Washington Post Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the American Civil Liberties Union are suing Wisconsin to try to block a new law that would require abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. The law, set to take effect Monday, was “rushed” through the legislative process last month, the groups said in a complaint filed Friday in federal court in Madison, Wis. The measure would force two of the state’s four abortion providers to shut down, according to the complaint. A fifth clinic is set to close for unrelated reasons, according to the groups. Wisconsin is one of several states where legal battles are taking place over newly introduced hospital-privilege requirements for abortion providers. Federal judges in Alabama and Mississippi have issued orders stopping similar laws from being implemented after finding that they might cause substantial burdens for women seeking to terminate pregnancies. Doctors performing abortions often have difficulty obtaining hospital privileges because they can’t meet certain terms, such as a minimum number of patient admissions, according to the ACLU. Less than 0.3 percent of abortion patients require hospitalization, the groups said in their complaint. Some hospitals may also have religious objections to offering admission privileges to abortion providers, the groups alleged.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1373250232267</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 22:23:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373254231385-7</Id><Title>Maybe not such a great idea</Title><Msg>July 7, 2013 By Anomaly The new law in Kansas which allows gun owners to carry weapons in public buildings, including schools, puts the school’s insurance at risk, including a major company that insures 85 percent to 90 percent of all Kansas school districts. Insurance companies think that it’s too much of a risk, and say that someone qualified and uniformed should carry the weapons. The NRA fully backed this law regardless of the obvious safety and business concerns. USA Today reports: The EMC Insurance Cos. insures 85 percent to 90 percent of all Kansas school districts and has refused to renew coverage for schools that permit teachers and custodians to carry concealed firearms on their campuses under the new law, which took effect July 1. It’s not a political decision, but a financial one based on the riskier climate it estimates would be created, the insurer said. “We’ve been writing school business for almost 40 years, and one of the underwriting guidelines we follow for schools is that any on-site armed security should be provided by uniformed, qualified law enforcement officers,” said Mick Lovell, EMC’s vice president for business development. “Our guidelines have not recently changed. The Kansas Legislature passed the law after the fatal shootings of 20 elementary school children in Newtown, Conn., in December. The law is similar to one in Utah. Around the country, firearms groups have called on schools to let teachers and staff carry weapons to protect children and prevent mass shootings. Another insurance company is doing the same in response to the law. Bob Skow, chief executive officer of the Independent Insurance Agents of Iowa said, ”It’s one thing to have a trained peace officer with a gun in school; it’s a completely different situation when you have a custodian or a teacher with a gun. That changes the risk of insuring a school and magnifies it considerably.”</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1373254231385</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-07 23:30:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
