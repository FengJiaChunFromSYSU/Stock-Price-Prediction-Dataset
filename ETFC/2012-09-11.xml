Cost of investigation and criminal conviction unknown.</Title><Msg>Canadian the only illegal alien caught in U.S. fake-voter dragnet PAUL KORING WASHINGTON — The Globe and Mail Published Monday, Sep. 10 2012, 4:00 AM EDT For months, Florida Republicans have been trying to clamp down on illegal aliens improperly included on on voting lists. It’s part of a m#$%$ive – and politically controversial – Republican effort to impose tough voter-identification measures. Democrats regard them as thinly disguised efforts to disproportionately disenfranchise the poor, African-Americans and Hispanics. Other Republican-controlled states are conducting similar culls. But after months of searching, only one alien falsely claiming to be a U.S. citizen has been caught, charged and convicted in Florida. It turns out he is a Canadian, a man who registered and voted in at least two presidential elections while masquerading as a citizen so he could also buy and “bear arms,” that other right cherished by many Americans. Josef Sever, 52, won’t be voting in Florida this November, though. He pleaded guilty on Aug. 30 in federal court in Miami to multiple felony charges of falsely attesting to be a U.S. citizen and illegally voting. Three days after the Nov. 6 election, when Americans will choose between giving Barack Obama a second term or sending Republican challenger Mitt Romney to the White House, Mr. Sever will be sentenced. He faces up to five years in prison before his long-running scam p#$%$ing as a U.S. citizen ends with deportation back to Canada. Republicans insist there’s nothing partisan about the dragnet. “The right to vote is a sacred right,” Florida’s Republican Governor Rick Scott said in June, in defending the state’s sweeping investigation of voter lists. “We gotta make sure a U.S. citizen’s right to vote is not diluted.” That the effort has only netted Mr. Sever so far has led to some considerable lampooning of Mr. Scott by liberal commentators. Under pressure from the governor, the state’s electoral officials had initially flagged more than 180,000 names (many of them Hispanic-sounding) for checking. All but 2,600 of those initially flagged – some of whom turned out to be not only citizens, but military veterans with service in Afghanistan and Iraq – were quickly determined to be bonafide citizens and restored to the voter rolls. After further investigation, only one name – Mr. Sever’s – was sent to law-enforcement authorities last spring. Six other “suspect” cases, in a state with more than 10 million names on the voters’ list, are still being investigated. Mr. Sever – who is white, of Austrian ancestry and became a Canadian citizen in 1979 – hardly fit the profile of Democrat-leaning Hispanic alien. Stefan Kamph, a commentator for New Times Broward-Palm Beach, finds the irony delicious. “Instead of seeing him as a criminal, the [Republican Party] should move to have Sever pardoned and hold him up on a pedestal,” he wrote. “After all, he abandoned the universal health care and tasty maple syrup of the Commie-nadian provinces to move to Florida, buy guns, and participate in the glory of our God-given democracy.” “Unless,” Mr. Kamph added, “he voted for Obama. Then boot his #$%$ back over the border.” No one, save Mr. Sever, knows how he voted. But he did admit as part of the facts agreed in his guilty plea that he voted in presidential elections in both 2004 and 2008. He had registered to vote with “no party affiliation,” according to court documents. When first tracked down and interviewed by Department of Homeland Security investigators last spring, Mr. Sever admitted to lying about being a U.S. citizen both to vote and – four times – to buy firearms and obtain a “concealed carry” permit which allows him to carry a hidden weapon. Last week, “Sever admitted that he was born in Austria, is a naturalized citizen of Canada, and has never been a U.S. citizen,” according to court documents. Whether his plea included a bargain for sentencing is unknown. His lawyer, Daniel Ecarius, a public defender provided by the state, declined comment. Falsely claiming to be a U.S. citizen carries a five-year maximum sentence on the firearm infractions and a one-year sentence on the voting felonies. U.S. Federal District Court Judge Ursula Ungaro set a sentencing date of Nov. 9. Judge Ungaro, an appointee of former president George W. Bush, is perhaps best known for a decision in which she ruled unconstitutional Mr. Scott’s plan to test all state employees for illegal drug use. In Mr. Sever’s case, she set bail at $50,000 (U.S.). But the Canadian, described in court as unemployed, has so far failed to find the required bond. Mr. Sever apparently has been in Florida for some time. “Public records indicate that he has lived in South Florida since at least 2004,” said Michelle Alvarez, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice in Florida. Other Florida company name registration records suggest someone with the same name and a signature matching Mr. Sever’s date back to 1998. As a Canadian, he has an inalienable right, under Canada’s Constitution, to return to Canada. It seems likely he will spend more time – perhaps several more years – in a Florida prison first.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347337249803</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 00:20:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347337995887-2</Id><Title>New evidence. Bush ignored repeated 9/11 warnings.</Title><Msg>September 10, 2012 The Deafness Before the Storm By KURT EICHENWALD IT was perhaps the most famous presidential briefing in history. On Aug. 6, 2001, President George W. Bush received a classified review of the threats posed by Osama bin Laden and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda. That morning’s “presidential daily brief” — the top-secret document prepared by America’s intelligence agencies — featured the now-infamous heading: “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.” A few weeks later, on 9/11, Al Qaeda accomplished that goal. On April 10, 2004, the Bush White House declassified that daily brief — and only that daily brief — in response to pressure from the 9/11 Commission, which was investigating the events leading to the attack. Administration officials dismissed the document’s significance, saying that, despite the jaw-dropping headline, it was only an assessment of Al Qaeda’s history, not a warning of the impending attack. While some critics considered that claim absurd, a close reading of the brief showed that the argument had some validity. That is, unless it was read in conjunction with the daily briefs preceding Aug. 6, the ones the Bush administration would not release. While those documents are still not public, I have read excerpts from many of them, along with other recently declassified records, and come to an inescapable conclusion: the administration’s reaction to what Mr. Bush was told in the weeks before that infamous briefing reflected significantly more negligence than has been disclosed. In other words, the Aug. 6 document, for all of the controversy it provoked, is not nearly as shocking as the briefs that came before it. The direct warnings to Mr. Bush about the possibility of a Qaeda attack began in the spring of 2001. By May 1, the Central Intelligence Agency told the White House of a report that “a group presently in the United States” was planning a terrorist operation. Weeks later, on June 22, the daily brief reported that Qaeda strikes could be “imminent,” although intelligence suggested the time frame was flexible. But some in the administration considered the warning to be just bluster. An intelligence official and a member of the Bush administration both told me in interviews that the neoconservative leaders who had recently assumed power at the Pentagon were warning the White House that the C.I.A. had been fooled; according to this theory, Bin Laden was merely pretending to be planning an attack to distract the administration from Saddam Hussein, whom the neoconservatives saw as a greater threat. Intelligence officials, these sources said, protested that the idea of Bin Laden, an Islamic fundamentalist, conspiring with Mr. Hussein, an Iraqi secularist, was ridiculous, but the neoconservatives’ suspicions were nevertheless carrying the day. In response, the C.I.A. prepared an analysis that all but pleaded with the White House to accept that the danger from Bin Laden was real. “The U.S. is not the target of a disinformation campaign by Usama Bin Laden,” the daily brief of June 29 read, using the government’s transliteration of Bin Laden’s first name. Going on for more than a page, the document recited much of the evidence, including an interview that month with a Middle Eastern journalist in which Bin Laden aides warned of a coming attack, as well as competitive pressures that the terrorist leader was feeling, given the number of Islamists being recruited for the separatist Russian region of Chechnya. And the C.I.A. repeated the warnings in the briefs that followed. Operatives connected to Bin Laden, one reported on June 29, expected the planned near-term attacks to have “dramatic consequences,” including major casualties. On July 1, the brief stated that the operation had been delayed, but “will occur soon.” Some of the briefs again reminded Mr. Bush that the attack timing was flexible, and that, despite any perceived delay, the planned assault was on track. Yet, the White House failed to take significant action. Officials at the Counterterrorism Center of the C.I.A. grew apoplectic. On July 9, at a meeting of the counterterrorism group, one official suggested that the staff put in for a transfer so that somebody else would be responsible when the attack took place, two people who were there told me in interviews. The suggestion was batted down, they said, because there would be no time to train anyone else. That same day in Chechnya, according to intelligence I reviewed, Ibn Al-Khattab, an extremist who was known for his brutality and his links to Al Qaeda, told his followers that there would soon be very big news. Within 48 hours, an intelligence official told me, that information was conveyed to the White House, providing more data supporting the C.I.A.’s warnings. Still, the alarm bells didn’t sound. On July 24, Mr. Bush was notified that the attack was still being readied, but that it had been postponed, perhaps by a few months. But the president did not feel the briefings on potential attacks were sufficient, one intelligence official told me, and instead asked for a broader analysis on Al Qaeda, its aspirations and its history. In response, the C.I.A. set to work on the Aug. 6 brief. In the aftermath of 9/11, Bush officials attempted to deflect criticism that they had ignored C.I.A. warnings by saying they had not been told when and where the attack would occur. That is true, as far as it goes, but it misses the point. Throughout that summer, there were events that might have exposed the plans, had the government been on high alert. Indeed, even as the Aug. 6 brief was being prepared, Mohamed al-Kahtani, a Saudi believed to have been assigned a role in the 9/11 attacks, was stopped at an airport in Orlando, Fla., by a suspicious customs agent and sent back overseas on Aug. 4. Two weeks later, another co-conspirator, Zacarias Moussaoui, was arrested on immigration charges in Minnesota after arousing suspicions at a flight school. But the dots were not connected, and Washington did not react. Could the 9/11 attack have been stopped, had the Bush team reacted with urgency to the warnings contained in all of those daily briefs? We can’t ever know. And that may be the most agonizing reality of all.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347337995887</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 00:33:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347339112087-3</Id><Topic><Title>GOP brain damage</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1347320043543</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 19:34:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Georgie Bush does not have the brain to sett anything in motion except start a stupid military invasion.

"But the dots were not connected, and Washington did not react." Who is supposed to connect the dots? White House? We had CIA and FBI which literally could not communicate with each other because of the policies established by Clinton administration. So, Bush's White House was supposed to resolve all that in 8 months and connect dots themselves? Fact is the signals indeed were coming in alarming numbers. But it isn't up to White House to connect the dots. We have CIA and FBI for decades to do exactly that. After 9/11 there were no signifficant terrorist attacks on US soil. But don't you think Fort Hood massacre must be prevented? It was pure negligence on the part of established policies in the military and should never happened. Where was Obama administration connecting the dots? Not trying to compare the magnitude of 9/11 with Fort Hood, but no one knows the magnitude until after attack. You have to make much more convincing case for negligence to blame Bush for letting 9/11 to happen.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1347384805988</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 13:33:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347385419174-14</Id><Topic><Title>New evidence.

The Ryan congressional ads start in the same week as presidential ticket mate Mitt Romney's commercials went on air in Wisconsin, although the cost for the two sets of ads are drawn from different campaign accounts.

It was two Capitol Police officers calling to deliver citations to him and his partner, Lisa Wells. They were each cited for two violations of Wisconsin Administrative Code: 2.14(2)(v) “obstruct access, passage, etc. (no permit)” and 2.08(1)(b) “holding signs over railings-prohibited.” Earlier in the day, Huberty and Wells had joined dozens of other defenders of free speech and assembly at the Capitol for the Solidarity Sing Along. At 5:30 pm Brandon Barwick was walking through the Capitol building when Capitol Police officer Mitch Steingraeber called him down to the Capitol Police Station to deliver his citation for violating WI Administrative Code 2.14(2)(v) “obstruct access, passage, etc. (no permit).” Barwick is a long-time participant in the Solidarity Sing Along. In the wake of last week’s highly publicized arrests of eleven citizens for holding signs in the Capitol rotunda, the Capitol Police have apparently changed tactics. Instead of the over-the-top displays of force used last week where eight to ten officers handcuffed and arrested alleged violators of the Department of Administration administrative code that prohibits displaying a sign without a permit, today officers videotaped the alleged offenses and hand delivered citations to people at home hours after the alleged offenses. Huberty, Wells and Barwick all say that they had not been warned that their behavior was in violation of the code. Officers made vague requests of Huberty and Wells to hold the banners with their hands instead of securing them with heavy objects. They complied with the requests. Barwick did not even speak with a Capitol Police officer until he was given the citation later in the afternoon.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347402670559</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 18:31:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347402953304-30</Id><Topic><Title>FLA GOP saves democracy!!!

That he, along with Dick Cheney, would do so to mark the solemn anniversary of the September 11 attacks is not just a national disgrace, but a personal one. After all, on the same day Thiessen made his claim that the Obama White House laughed off as "hilarious," new revelations about the Bush administration's fatal lack of concern over the Al Qaeda threat to the U.S. homeland in 2001 came to light. Which is why Team Bush, the one which protested that "nobody could have predicted" the 9/11 tragedy, the chaos in Iraq, the Katrina disaster, the 2008 economic collapse and so much more, will forever be remembered by the words of Condoleezza Rice and President Bush himself: "I believe the title was 'Bin Laden determined to strike in U.S.'" "All right. You've covered your a**, now." Writing in the New York Times, 500 Days author Kurt Eichenwald documented the Bush administration's near-total deafness to the rapidly growing threat from Osama Bin Laden in the summer of 2001. While Americans learned three years later of the famous August 6, 2001 PDB ("Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S"), Eichenwald's findings show the Bush White House pre-occupied with Saddam Hussein at best and, at worst, asleep at the wheel: The direct warnings to Mr. Bush about the possibility of a Qaeda attack began in the spring of 2001. By May 1, the Central Intelligence Agency told the White House of a report that "a group presently in the United States" was planning a terrorist operation. Weeks later, on June 22, the daily brief reported that Qaeda strikes could be "imminent," although intelligence suggested the time frame was flexible... "The U.S. is not the target of a disinformation campaign by Usama Bin Laden," the daily brief of June 29 read...And the C.I.A. repeated the warnings in the briefs that followed. Operatives connected to Bin Laden, one reported on June 29, expected the planned near-term attacks to have "dramatic consequences," including major casualties. On July 1, the brief stated that the operation had been delayed, but "will occur soon." Some of the briefs again reminded Mr. Bush that the attack timing was flexible, and that, despite any perceived delay, the planned assault was on track. This week's revelations represent the first details on the contents of a trove of 120 previously secret documents concerning the September 11, 2001 attacks obtained by the National Security Archive. As NSA's Barbara Elias-Sanborn concluded, "I don't think the Bush administration would want to see these released." Salon's Jordan Michael Smith explained why: Many of the documents publicize for the first time what was first made clear in the 9/11 Commission: The White House received a truly remarkable amount of warnings that al-Qaida was trying to attack the United States. From June to September 2001, a full seven CIA Senior Intelligence Briefs detailed that attacks were imminent, an incredible amount of information from one intelligence agency. One from June called "Bin-Ladin and Associates Making Near-Term Threats" writes that "[redacted] expects Usama Bin Laden to launch multiple attacks over the coming days." The famous August brief called "Bin Ladin Determined to Strike the US" is included. "Al-Qai'da members, including some US citizens, have resided in or travelled to the US for years, and the group apparently maintains a support structure here," it says. During the entire month of August, President Bush was on vacation at his ranch in Texas -- which tied with one of Richard Nixon's as the longest vacation ever taken by a president. CIA Director George Tenet has said he didn't speak to Bush once that month, describing the president as being "on leave." Bush did not hold a Principals' meeting on terrorism until September 4, 2001, having downgraded the meetings to a deputies' meeting, which then-counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke has repeatedly said slowed down anti-Bin Laden efforts "enormously, by months." That's a far cry from the image of the President Bush, Republicans were so fond of telling Americans, who "kept us safe." As George W. Bush was taking office in early 2001, the Hart-Rudman Commission on U.S. National Security issued its report declaring "The combination of unconventional weapons proliferation with the persistence of international terrorism will end the relative invulnerability of the U.S. homeland to catastrophic attack" and cautioning "many thousands of American lives" are at risk. At a transition briefing in the White House situation room during the first week of January, Clinton National Security Adviser Sandy Berger warned his successor Condoleezza Rice, "I believe that the Bush Administration will spend more time on terrorism generally, and on al-Qaeda specifically, than any other subject." And on January 25, 2001, counterrorism czar Richard Clarke (who helped lead the 1996 effort to protect the Atlanta Olympics from, among other things, threats from hijacked aircraft) handed the Bush national security team the famous Delenda plan for attacking Al Qaeda. But in the aftermath of the horrific 9/11 attacks, Condi Rice played the role of a reverse Nostradmus, detailing the myriad foreign policy and security disasters she failed to predict. Confronted by 9/11 commissioner Richard Ben Veniste about the August 6, 2001 PDB (Presidential Daily Brief) which warned of "patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks," national security adviser Rice responded: "I believe the title was 'Bin Laden determined to strike in U.S.'" For his part, the vacationing President George W. Bush responded to the CIA presenter of the infamous August 6, 2001 Presidential Daily Brief (PDB) which warned of Al Qaeda's intent to attack the U.S. homeland by declaring: "All right. You've covered your a**, now." On March 22, 2004, Rice took to the op-ed pages of the Washington Post to argue, "No al-Qaeda threat was turned over to the new administration." And in an argument she would later make repeatedly, Rice first introduced the now ubiquitous "nobody could have predicted" defense on May 16, 2002: "I don't think anybody could have predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into the World Trade Center, take another one and slam it into the Pentagon; that they would try to use an airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a missile. All of this reporting about hijacking was about traditional hijacking." In early 2008, White House spokesman Tony Fratto showed that Rice's talking point still had legs. Spoon-fed last month by Fox News anchor Jon Scott's suggestion that "nobody was thinking that there'd be terrorists flying 767s into buildings at that point," Fratto reliably coughed up the laughably discredited sound bite: "That's true. I mean, no one could have anticipated that kind of attack - or very few people." As late as January 2009, Vice President Dick Cheney was adamant that "I wouldn't have predicted 9/11" or any of the other calamities which defined the Bush years: "No, obviously, I wouldn't have predicted that. On the other hand I wouldn't have predicted 9/11, the global war on terror, the need to simultaneous run military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq or the near collapse of the financial system on a global basis, not just the U.S." As late as December 2009, Cheney aide Mary Matalin was blaming the slaughter which occurred during Bush's watch on his predecessor: "I was there, we inherited a recession from President Clinton, and we inherited the most tragic attack on our own soil in our nation's history." Eleven years later, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has inherited George Bush's neoconservative advisers. As for Osama Bin Laden, that's one problem the next president won't have to deal with. Thanks to the special operations raid President Obama ordered and candidate Romney opposed, Osama Bin Laden is dead. But according to a 2007 biography of Ariel Sharon, that's not quite the fate Bush had in mind for the 9/11 mastermind. As the Israeli paper Ha'aretz described this purported exchange between President Bush and Sharon: Speaking of George Bush, with whom Sharon developed a very close relationship, Uri Dan recalls that Sharon's delicacy made him reluctant to repeat what the president had told him when they discussed Osama bin Laden. Finally he relented. And here is what the leader of the Western world, valiant warrior in the battle of cultures, promised to do to bin Laden if he caught him: "I will screw him in the a**!" As for the Bushies, they would be advised to choose a different day to cover their own.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347407326796</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 19:48:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347409931078-32</Id><Topic><Title>After 11 years, the massive scope of the Bush incompetence comes to light</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347407326796</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 19:48:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>get some sleep ..this is a stock board not a funny story book..

As Politifact, and the whole menagerie of “fact checking” organizations have demonstrated themselves to be slavishly attached to the Administration’s nether regions I will consider quoting any of them, in a non-ironic way, as being evidence of arguing in bad faith and worthy of a ban. What do you think? I think you just divorced reality. Mitt Romney created 100 million jobs as Gov of Massachusetts. Disagree? YOU'RE BANNED! It's like open bar for liars. A place where lies and falsehoods can never be proven false. And CNN pays Erick Erickson of RedState dotcom for his "commentary", the same guy who manages a website that will ban you if you quote fact-checkers at them. I guess when CNN introduces Erickson they will have to ad a caveat to his byline (Founder of RedState dotcom, statements made at RedState dotcom are not intended to be a factual statement.) Who woke up on 9/11 today and decided the whole problem with this country is the fact checkers? If it wasn't for the American public's insistence on arithmetic, science and knowing recent history it would be really good news for John McCain Mitt Romney. Basically admitting that you can't win a debate unless the public is as ignorant as possible should be a bad thing, shouldn't it? Face it, this is what a small tent getting smaller looks like. A small tent that is about to get demoralized in the upcoming Presidential election. Reality doesn't just have a liberal bias, reality is actually a liberal conspiracy. And don't believe any non partisan fact-checking organizations who say otherwise, they are clearly in the tank for reality.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347410395971</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 20:39:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347418741145-34</Id><Topic><Title>GOP bans fact checkers</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347410395971</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 20:39:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is this freakin' thing working???????????

AND THIS STILL SMELLS : September 11, 2002 8:00 a.m. The bin Ladens’ Great Escape How the U.S. helped Osama's family leave the country after 9/11. Bill Carter, the FBI spokesman, is adamant. "We were given full access to the individuals on that plane," he says, "and we were satisfied that we did not believe any of those individuals had anything to do with the 9/11 plots." The plane to which Carter refers was an aircraft chartered by the Saudi government in the days after the terrorist attacks. The individuals were two dozen members of Osama bin Laden's extended family who had been living in the United States. Saying they were afraid that family members might suffer retribution in the U.S., the Saudis asked for American assistance in getting them out of the country. With the help of the FBI, the Saudis and the bin Laden family chartered an aircraft to pick up family members in Los Angeles, Orlando, and Washington, D.C. The bin Laden plane then flew the relatives to Boston, where — one week after the attacks — the group left Logan Airport bound for Jeddah. At the time, the massive 9/11 investigation was just beginning. The government had begun detaining hundreds of people who were held for days, weeks, or months while U.S. agents performed extensive background checks and interviews. In addition, the government announced its intention to question thousands of men from Muslim countries who might simply have known something of interest to the investigation. "The Department of Justice is waging a deliberate campaign of arrest and detention to protect American lives," Attorney General John Ashcroft said on November 27. But the bin Ladens did not have to worry about that. While FBI agents looked into bin Laden family members in the Boston area immediately after September 11, it appears that the agents' first chance to interview them — or other family members who lived elsewhere in the country — came on the day they left the U.S. Each family member was given the all-clear on the basis of a single, day-of-departure interview — conducted, in Bill Carter's words, "at the airport, as they were about to leave." Asked by National Review whether the FBI had conducted a full and thorough investigation of all the family members before allowing them to go, Carter repeated his earlier statement: "The FBI had an opportunity to interview the individuals on that plane, and we were satisfied with the information they provided." Asked again, he said the same thing. "Unless you have evidence to stop them from leaving the country, they have every right to do that," Carter explained. "The bin Laden family is very large, and for the most part are involved in legitimate enterprises. The fact of the matter is that because of September 11, some of these individuals felt it would be better to leave the country. They have every right to do that." But some law-enforcement experts found the abbreviated investigation puzzling. "That's highly unusual, and they could not have done a thorough and complete interview," said John L. Martin, the former chief of internal security for the Justice Department. "It was obvious at the time that the Bureau did not have the kind of intelligence to know who was behind [the September 11 attacks], how they were financed, and what the U.S. connections might have been." Also, Martin said, "It is an absolute rule of law enforcement that the agent or officers conducting the interviews control the interview, and that the persons of interest, suspects, or prospective defendants do not set the ground rules for the interview." In addition, it is a routine law-enforcement practice to question — sometimes repeatedly and in great detail — family members of suspects in murder cases. Investigators do not usually presume that a relative has no connection or knowledge of a crime; instead, they usually conduct an investigation to make sure the relatives can be eliminated as suspects or witnesses. While that is going on, the instincts of law enforcement are normally to freeze all potential suspects and witnesses in place until the investigation has reached some conclusions. What raises even more questions about the FBI's handling of the bin Ladens is that in the days immediately after the attack, law-enforcement agencies were nearly overwhelmed by the task of unraveling the plot and uncovering al Qaeda's complex worldwide financial network. Investigators were still trying to retrace the hijackers' steps and learn who might have assisted them along the way. They were also facing the enormous job of trying to uncover any other terrorist cells that might be in the country. The FBI in particular was almost back on its heels, suffering from (it was revealed later) a lack of communication between its various offices about key evidence in the case. And the bin Ladens seemed an obvious choice for intensive investigation. Most press accounts of the family state flatly that the relatives are estranged from Osama bin Laden and condemn his work. But bin Laden has more than 50 siblings, and it is perhaps overly optimistic to think that every single one of them not only does not approve of his actions but also has no knowledge of his support and financing. Besides, there are several published reports that suggest otherwise. In October 2001, ABC News interviewed a sister-in-law of Osama bin Laden, who was asked whether bin Laden family members had given money to Osama. "I don't know that," Carmen bin Laden answered, "but my opinion is yes . . . I think they would say, okay, this is — for Islam they would give. You know, for Islam they would give." Carmen bin Laden is the estranged wife of Osama bin Laden's brother Yeslam, who runs the Saudi Investment Company in Switzerland. Family friends have contradicted her account, but in March of this year, French police searched Yeslam bin Laden's villa in Cannes, reportedly looking for evidence of terrorism-related money laundering involving the Saudi Investment Company. Swiss police also searched other properties connected to the firm. In addition, investigators believe that another bin Laden relative, Osama's brother-in-law Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, is thought to be an important figure in al Qaeda. Khalifa has been linked to Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, as well as to the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole. Khalifa is also thought to have provided crucial start-up money to Abu Sayyaf, the Philippine terrorist group. Then there are the bin Ladens' alleged ties to a Bahamas-based bank that is suspected of laundering money to terrorist groups. And, finally, there are Osama bin Laden's communications with his stepmother, Al-Khalifa bin Laden. He reportedly called her days before September 11 to tell her that "something big" would soon take place. It may turn out that no one among the bin Ladens in America knew anything about any of the people involved or any of their businesses. It is true that the family members had been the subject of some scrutiny in the past. "That family had been looked at very, very carefully in the two-year period leading up to September 11," after the al Qaeda bombings of American embassies in East Africa, said retired CIA official Vince Cannistraro. But the fact that the September 11 attacks occurred raises obvious questions about how thorough the U.S. law-enforcement and intelligence agencies' investigation of bin Laden was. In light of that, how much did the FBI know about the bin Laden family when it allowed them to leave the country? And could investigators have learned everything they needed to know on the basis of the day-of-departure airport interviews? It's hard to reconstruct precisely how the departures were arranged. The only public statement the Saudis have made was in October 2001, when Prince Bandar, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., said on CNN, "His Majesty said it's not fair for these innocent people to be subjected to any harm. On the other hand, we understood the high emotions. So with the coordination with the FBI, we got them all out." Otherwise, officials at the Saudi embassy in Washington decline to comment. When NR called an official at Logan Airport, he said, "You have to talk to the State Department. They're the ones who set it up." But a State Department source said the department "played no role" in the matter. "This is not something we would have brokered," the source said. "Bandar does not need Foggy Bottom to get a phone call returned by the White House." That seemed a clear hint that the White House was involved, but the White House declined immediate comment, saying it would look into the matter. However it happened, the bin Ladens are long gone. Some have returned, at least for visits — they live in an international set that divides its time among Jeddah, London, Paris, and New York. Others have stayed away. Now, a year after 9/11, should U.S law enforcement ever need them, investigators will know where they are — in Saudi Arabia, out of reach.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347421199988</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 23:39:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347421932801-37</Id><Title>Republicans Don't Care ........</Title><Msg>That they made horrible mistakes in the past.

This morning, Cramer tweeted about his father, a Pennsylvania resident who stands to lose his right to vote because of the state’s new restrictive voter ID law. Like thousands of Pennsylvania who could be disenfranchised in November, Cramer’s father lacks a voter ID because he’s a senior citizen and does not drive. Cramer also noted that he doesn’t have access to his citizenship documents.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1347422391631</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 23:59:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
