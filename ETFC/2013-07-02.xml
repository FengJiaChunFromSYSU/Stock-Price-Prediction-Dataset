Not so. After six months of living on the streets he had lost the shirt on his back – literally. Identified as an easy target he was chased, beaten and robbed of the backpack containing all his worldly goods. “He grabbed me by the hair, threw me to the ground and started dragging me,” he said of his attacker. “My shirt was ripped off and I got a black eye and a bloody nose,” he said. “San Francisco is not the gay-friendly mecca that they say it is.”</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1372801409043</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 17:43:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372802179531-40</Id><Topic><Title>Spank her for Jesus</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1372647412722</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 22:56:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Speaking of religious financial fraud: "According to documents released today, Cardinal Timothy Dolan, the archbishop of New York, moved nearly $57 million into a cemetery trust fund in 2007 specifically to shield it from lawsuits by victims of clergy sexual abuse. The New York Times has the scoop: [T]he files released Monday contain a letter [Dolan] wrote to the Vatican in 2007, in which he explained that by transferring the assets, “I foresee an improved protection of these funds from any legal claim and liability.” The Vatican moved swiftly to approve the request, the files show, even though it often took years to remove known abusers from the priesthood. The files also reveal graphic details of the alleged abuse, including new revelations about its magnitude: Archbishop Listecki released a letter last week warning Catholics in his archdiocese that the documents could shake their faith and trying to explain the actions of church leaders while offering apologies to victims. “Prepare to be shocked,” he wrote. “There are some graphic descriptions about the behavior of some of these priest offenders.” Although Dolan has no direct connection with the abuse, he has long been suspected of helping to protect the Church from its repercussions, particularly during his tenure as the archbishop of Milwaukee: Cardinal Dolan’s moves involving church assets have come under particular scrutiny. Lawyers for the victims said the documents would prove that he transferred $130 million from the church’s books — about $55 million in a cemetery account, and $75 million in an investment account — to shield the money from abuse victims. This latest bombshell arrives after a tough week for Dolan: On Wednesday, he issued a joint press release calling the Supreme Court's DOMA ruling a "tragic day for marriage and our nation" that went against "the common good of all, especially our children."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1372802179531</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 17:56:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>14</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372802391841-41</Id><Topic><Title>BO the Conqueror</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1372797626535</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 16:40:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let Detroit Go Bankrupt By MITT ROMNEY Published: November 18, 2008 IF General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye.

One purpose of the 11-hour visit on Dec. 3, squeezed between NATO talks on the future of Afghanistan and the Syrian civil war, was to make a personal appeal to Czech Prime Minister Petr Nečas on behalf of Westinghouse Electric, which is vying for a contract to build a nuclear power plant there. The company is locked in a $10 billion bidding war with a state-owned Russian energy giant, and Clinton pressed the Czech officials about the wisdom of depending on Vladimir Putin’s Russia for something as essential as electricity. Westinghouse Chief Executive Danny Roderick, who’s still awaiting a decision, says Clinton’s intervention made a big impression on the Czechs: “I was proud that she was in the trenches with me.” In four years as the nation’s top diplomat, Clinton, who is expected to step down this month, has made dozens of similar sales pitches on behalf of U.S. companies. In 2009 she toured a Boeing plant in Moscow and met with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to persuade state-owned Russian Technologies to buy 50 Boeing 737s instead of jets made by Airbus. That $3.7 billion deal was one of several large contracts Clinton helped clinch for Boeing (BA). In December 2011, Lockheed Martin (LMT) announced a $7.2 billion deal to upgrade Japan’s aging fighter jet fleet, beating out Eurofighter. Clinton advocated for the contract with her Japanese counterpart at the United Nations General Assembly. In February 2012, Space Systems/Loral, which builds communications satellites in Palo Alto, won a contract for equipment to create a national broadband network in Australia. Clinton met with former Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd several times to press for the deal.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1372822799056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:39:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372822864047-56</Id><Topic><Title>Coming in only 180 weeks, Hillary the Conqueror!!</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1372822799056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-02 23:39:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In February 2012, Space Systems/Loral, which builds communications satellites in Palo Alto, won a contract for equipment to create a national broadband network in Australia.
