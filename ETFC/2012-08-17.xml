It is I again, Mitt Romney, your better. I have still been recovering from the last few days, which have been severely non-uproarious. Between the Mr. Bus incident, having to choose a vice presidential unit, and my opponent saying several rude things about me, I have been seriously considering abandoning this entire effort. Looking for inspiration, I resorted to looking through my old tax returns. Looking at my tax returns never fails to reinvigorate me, and this time was no exception. "Observe," I said to myself. "According to this, you have perhaps paid as much as perhaps 13-point-something percent in taxes over these last years. Is that not cruel and outrageous, self?" It is indeed cruel and outrageous. I remember now why I have not been creating any jobs in private industry for so many years. There hardly seems any point, if I shall only be able to keep 86-point-something percent of the resulting income. No one would purchase 86-point-something percent of a yacht, or tolerate having only 86-point-something percent of a private island. During my required evening telephone call with the new vice presidential unit, he agreed with me that I was correct to be outraged, and reminded me that under his own tax proposals I would have only needed to relinquish zero-point-something percent. He was sorry that he had not proposed zero-point-zero percent, and said in hindsight that zero-point-zero percent was certainly an even better percent. I will admit that the conversation cheered me considerably. I do not know whether or not I shall ever stop finding this vice presidential unit irritating, but his stance on the outrageousness of having to pay a 13-point-something percent tax rate certainly helps mask many of his other shortcomings. I also like his ability to explain why his past stances are not his current stances, and how his past stances were retroactively not his past stances. I also appreciate his convictions on the issues of budgets and how the details of budgets should not be disclosed except in quiet rooms, and only to other units of wealth, since only units of wealth can properly evaluate their obvious wisdom. I admit he is similar to me in many ways, only slightly smaller in chassis and considerably reduced in wallet. He is beginning to grow on me, albeit slowly. I have begun to refer to him as Mini-Mitt.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345178488000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 00:41:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345182536000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Nomura Securities maintains a 'Buy' on E*TRADE price target of $10.50.</Title><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1345163069000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 20:24:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think ETFC is heading toward $11+ I expect a rally tomorrow!!! $8.80+</Msg><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1345182536000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 01:48:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345183466000-3</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on the old</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345091454000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:30:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rampant..if everybody will have to buy insurance, the insurance companies will double their rates and many more who have insurance now want be able to afford it!

In black and white. Here is another proof. The President in his own words: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=t5Ha7RNpn24 Obamacare defenders saying $716B are not cuts to Medicare, those cuts are money going to overpayments in Medicare Advantage program. This is pure obfuscation of the language. "Overpayments"? It is Obamacare definition to say Medicare paid too much for services. Really? Who defined that? Where exactly in the law it is defined what excess was? Unless the law specifically defines that same services are not being cut, i.e. will be provided same as today but for lower costs, this "overpayments" is simply deceptive word. Now, "The Ryan budget puts those $700 billion into the Medicare trust fund, to shore up the program’s future and reduce the deficit, rather than spending the money on yet another new entitlement. And Mitt Romney proposes not to make those Obamacare cuts in the first place — keeping the money in Medicare’s operating budget and so leaving the program simply as it is for today’s seniors and starting his premium-support reform for younger Americans when they retire, beginning a decade from now." I wouldn't bring here inconsistency of Romney taken positions. The all time record for that is beyond any doubt held by a man currently occupying oval office.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1345183626000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 02:07:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345186473000-5</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on the old</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345091454000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:30:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>union...........I have to agree with you, it's NOT a question of IF but WHEN, if we don't whip out Iran's program - because the Israelis will - and I think in the winter (here) that's when the fighting conditions are most favorable and chemical warfare is a lesser problem!

Credit Suisse's report on trading activity shows that over the past four years, volumes in equity markets have been steadily falling and are now at half the level seen in the middle of the credit crisis - and traders fear they could get worse. After surveying trade desks in the U.S., Europe and Asia, the report found that 76 percent of institutions are trading "a lot less", with 35 and 40 percent of desks responding that they were trading "well below average - down 20 percent" and "below average - down 10 percent" respectively. And there is no sign that there will be any change in a hurry, with 83 percent of respondents telling Credit Suisse that it would take 2-5 years (or possibly more) for volumes to recover. As long as global economic woes continue unabated and unresolved, or indeed approach in the months ahead, trading activity would stay subdued and risk averse, according to traders. "Almost half of the responses said macro-risk needs to be resolved before trading activity is up...This is consistent with the popular view that macro risks are a key factor in decreasing investor risk-appetite - including European defaults, recessions, the U.S. fiscal cliff and its own deficit," the report said, adding, "It's unlikely all will be resolved in less than a year." This view was also borne by Chris Watling, CEO of Longview Economics, who told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday that market volumes in equity markets will "grind slowly higher", dependant on policy decisions from the European Central Bank for the euro zone that could in turn, he said, stop deleveraging in equity markets. "[Equity markets] are grinding slowly higher...and the important thing is policy, policy, policy," Watling said. However, traders in the Credit Suisse survey are worried not only over macro-economic risks, falling liquidity and increased trading costs. The introduction of a High Frequency Trading (HFT) tax and regulation in order to countenance market manipulation and risk, could further damage liquidity and restrict trading, according to the majority of traders surveyed. Over 70 percent of traders said that pending regulations and HFT taxes (55 percent) would hurt liquidity. The trading strategy team which authored the report states that rather than hope for change, "traders need to adapt or perish". Indeed, many are changing: "The majority of traders in our survey prefer to spend more time looking for natural blocks now - to counteract the costs of reduced liquidity." Traders needed to prepare for change as more and more investors turn to cheaper, electronic execution, the report stated. More trading institutions were looking for "quality over quantity...trimming broker lists...rather than reducing all commission spend equally" and traders needed to "adapt or perish" in order to survive. "Brokers are stuck in a deflationary environment and will need to consolidate, become more efficient, or find a product that is differentiated, and therefore holds its value." Evolving as a trader meant that the market could then "evolve based on product rather than scale" the report said. Those that don't adapt, "may be hurting their funds for an extended period," the report states.</Msg><Username>princesslabium</Username><Timestamp>1345207522000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 08:45:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345211104000-9</Id><Title>good morning 3 dollars or so,</Title><Msg>same old platform, same old debt laden bank, and Griffin with his Citadel Capital Chicago Mob money front running this purchase and that sale and every one they broker......the fix is in they have the inside bid and the outside ask all covered for fractions or wholes on every trade.. check out BATS new retail pricing, google it yoursel !! sell to the $3.00's</Msg><Username>nurse26yrs</Username><Timestamp>1345211104000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 09:45:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345211370000-10</Id><Topic><Title>shorting it till low 7's</Title><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1345143335000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:55:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with you.

Here are seven: 1) What kind of taxes? Does that 13 percent cover income taxes, capital gains taxes, or some combination? By Romney’s own admission, nearly all of his income comes from investments (so the low capital gains tax rate helps him drive his overall rate far below that of many middle-class families). 2) What sort of deductions did Romney employ? In addition to the deduction they receive for classifying Ann Romney’s horse as a business, what other deductions are the Romneys using to lower their tax rate? 3) How did Romney’s IRA grow so large? Romney’s retirement account contains more than $100 million, despite annual limits on contributions. How did that happen? 4) What sort of offshore tax strategies does Romney use? While Romney was on the executive committee of Marriott, the company employed complex strategies known as “Son of Boss” to dodge taxes, prompting consequences with the IRS. Did Romney use a similar strategy for his own taxes? 5) Was Romney’s Swiss bank account disclosed on all tax returns for all years? Did he file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) as required by the deadline for each year he had the account? 6) Did Romney participate in the IRS’s settlement initiative for undeclared offshore financial accounts (the amnesty)? In 2009, the IRS gave American citizens a window to declare their Swiss bank accounts and avoid prosecution for tax dodging, before it launched a crackdown on foreign accounts. As Slate’s Matt Yglesias wrote, “Romney might well have thought in 2007 and 2008 that there was nothing to fear about a non-disclosed offshore account he’d set up years earlier precisely because it wasn’t disclosed. But then came the settlement and the rush of non-disclosers to apply for the amnesty.” 7) Why did Romney invest in Houston rental real estate that was explicitly marketed as a tax shelter? As The New York Times reported, Romney was an investor in a real estate scheme in which the organizers “played up the tax shelter benefits.” The deal turned out to be a lousy investment. On a final note, does Romney think that the 20 prominent conservatives calling for more tax returns are “small minded”?</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345213400000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:23:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345214274000-18</Id><Title>Wimp ensnared</Title><Msg>Whiteboard Face Off: ThinkProgress Takes On Romney’s Medicare Madness By Igor Volsky on Aug 16, 2012 at 12:58 pm Mitt Romney offered a white board presentation during a news briefing in South Carolina on Thursday morning that sought to untangle the campaign’s contradictory message about Medicare. Over the last week, Romney and Ryan have twisted themselves into a pretzel to attack President Obama for “stealing” $716 billion from Medicare, while trying to explain why Paul Ryan included the savings in his FY 2013 budget. Romney had previously pledged to sign the document into law. During the presentation, Romney tried to lay out the differences. Obama takes the money out of seniors’ Medicare Advantage plans and cuts payments to providers, causing some to lose his coverage, he argued. The program’s trust fund would go bankrupt by 2024, under Obama, and seniors would lose access to the care they need. His plan, alternatively, would preserve the program for current retirees and keep it solvent indefinitely. It's full of lies as we see here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=jjMKjr_jJjo The Obamacare savings slow the growth of Medicare over the next decade by, in part: eliminating overpayments to private insurers in Medicare Advantage, reforming provider payments to encourage greater efficiency, tying reimbursements to improvements in economic productivity, and reducing fraud and abuse. The law does not impact patient benefits. As a result of these savings, “growth in spending will be restrained” and the life of the Medicare trust fund is expanded by eight years, the government estimates. Sixteen million seniors are also benefiting from the savings by receiving preventive benefits without deductibles or co-pays and saving more than $3.9 billion on prescription drugs. Should Romney restore the $716 billion — and unless he institutes other yet to be specified reforms — we would move back to the old system of overpaying private insurers and providers. He’d be re-inserting inefficiency back into the system, jeopardizing the benefits that seniors are currently enjoying, and shrinking the solvency of the Medicare trust fund from 2024 under current law to 2016.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345214274000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:37:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345214428000-19</Id><Title>Take Your Angry Campaign and Go Back To Chicago</Title><Msg>Anger and divisiveness are not American.</Msg><Username>islam_needs_new_ceo_now</Username><Timestamp>1345214428000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:40:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>18</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345215230000-20</Id><Title>Ryan caught lying</Title><Msg>Paul Ryan WASHINGTON-- In a television interview with WCPO Cincinnati, Republican vice presidential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) directly contradicted an Associated Press report that said he had sought stimulus funds for his congressional district, while at the same time publicly decrying the bill as a "wasteful spending spree." "No, I never asked for stimulus," Ryan said when questioned on reports that he had sought funds. Ryan's statement directly counters the evidence of four letters obtained by the AP which the congressman wrote to Energy Secretary Steven Chu, praising energy programs supported by the stimulus and requesting funds for initiatives in his district. Ryan's private praise for Department of Energy programs and his written requests for stimulus funds contradict not only his public criticism of the 2009 stimulus bill, but also many of the budget priorities he has laid out, including cuts to investments in green technologies. The Boston Globe reported that in 2010, after writing several letters to federal departments requesting stimulus funds for his district, Ryan told a caller on Boston talk radio show WBZ Nightside with Dan Rea that he would never vote against the stimulus bill and "then write to the government to ask them to send us money." Ryan went on to state that he "did not request any stimulus money." Raising further questions about the vice presidential candidate's claim today that he never sought stimulus money, Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck referred AP to previous explanations by the congressman's office that by requesting funds Ryan was simply "providing a legitimate constituent service." "If Congressman Ryan is asked to help a Wisconsin entity applying for existing federal grant funds, he does not believe flawed policy should get in the way of doing his job," Ryan's office said when first asked about the funding requests by the Wall Street Journal in 2010. UPDATE: 11:59 p.m. -- Ryan responded Thursday night with a statement that said the letters "should have been handled differently." "After having these letters called to my attention I checked into them, and they were treated as constituent service requests in the same way matters involving Social Security or Veterans Affairs are handled," Ryan said in the statement. "This is why I didn't recall the letters earlier," he added. "But they should have been handled differently, and I take responsibility for that. Regardless, it's clear that the Obama stimulus did nothing to stimulate the economy, and now the president is asking to do it all over again."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345215230000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:53:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345215631000-21</Id><Topic><Title>Take Your Angry Campaign and Go Back To Chicago</Title><Username>islam_needs_new_ceo_now</Username><Timestamp>1345214428000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:40:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>American people have a right to know about the candidates for POTUS.

Ryan's amended reports were hand delivered to the House Clerk with letters characterizing the belated disclosures as an "inadvertent omission." -snip- Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said "the amount and timing of this new disclosure suggests that Ryan had not sought to be fully transparent about his income and investments until he felt compelled to do so."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345217715000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 11:35:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345218457000-26</Id><Title>Food versus Ethanol</Title><Msg>Right now quit producing Ethanol! #1 It was/is a good income source for Farmers, but with the drought, we need Corn for Food.

"Patient Centered Homes" or "Accountable Care Organizations"(ACOs) are the new buzzwords in healthcare now. These models would eliminate the solo and small medical practices who rely on fee for service to survive. Medicare and private insurance would send a check to the ACOs instead of the physicians who do the work. The ACOs would get a bonus if they spend less money on healthcare than their peers and dole out a flat fee to salaried physicians. Physicians would become employees of the ACOs or run the ACOs and hire PAs and Nurse Practitioners to grind out the patients. The ACOs in the future would resemble a large facility like a VA Hospital every 20 miles with a waiting room the size of a football field. You would be assigned a facility for all your healthcare needs. Quality measures would initially seem like a reasonable idea. Implementing "quality" would eventually become too expensive and time consuming and "quality" would become synonymous with lower cost and rationed care. jmo tdc</Msg><Username>tradedotcom</Username><Timestamp>1345227381000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 14:16:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345227712000-43</Id><Topic><Title>romneyann high on koch</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345226894000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 14:08:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Allowing changes that are scheduled under current law to take effect—including the expiration of tax cuts that originally went into effect in 2001 and 2003—is one of many possible approaches for preventing deficits from growing in an unsustainable way.

Paul: "I'm dumb enough to believe I can." How bad a presidential candidate is Mitt Romney? So bad that, according to Politico, his own campaign is not even trying to pretend he doesn't suck. He's got the charm of a dust mite, he's already "exhausted" from campaigning, he can't draw big crowds, and no one likes him. So they're hoping that Paul "Hail Mary" Ryan can give him that special something he needs to save his destined-to-fail campaign: Romney and Ryan had planned to go their separate ways before meeting up at the end of the month at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. But then campaign strategists saw how much of a psychic boost Romney got from Ryan — and how much more animated Romney appeared on television with his younger running mate at his side. “They really like each other and they feed off of each other,” campaign manager Matt Rhoades said. “There’s an energy, there’s a chemistry.” Advisers say Ryan helps ease the former governor’s feeling of isolation. Romney's "feeling of isolation"? From what? His wife on the trail with him? His sons on the trail with him? The voters who think he's really weird because he doesn't know how to talk to people without insulting them and their cookies and their country? His money stashed far away in exotic islands? Mitt Romney is running for president, for Pete's sake, and it's his name at the top of the ticket—as the campaign apparently has to continue reminding everyone—but he's made such a mess of it that now the campaign desperately, very desperately, hopes the risky VP pick and his boost-giving P90X body will save Romney from a humiliating defeat at the hands of President Obama. If that sounds familiar, it should. It was the same risky move John McCain made in 2008 when he picked Sarah Palin to give him and his flaccid campaign a boost. And while Palin (like Ryan) could draw bigger crowds than the top-of-the-ticket candidate and could fire up the base with all of her hate speech and lies, that didn't make McCain look better or more presidential, and it didn't save his campaign either. After weeks of insisting that the Romney campaign had learned the hard lessons of 2008 and would very deliberately do the opposite of everything McCain did, including seeking an "incredibly boring white guy" for the VP spot to avoid any Palintastrophes, the fact that the campaign has thrown out its carefully devised anti-McCain strategy and is now following the same disastrous roadmap McCain did, starting with, in McCain's own words, "a pretty bold choice" for the VP slot, is pretty shocking. This is a strategy Romneyland has said repeatedly is a loser, and yet, they've run out of all other options. Can't talk about Romney's time as governor. Can't talk about Romney's time at Bain. Ann, his supposed "greatest asset," isn't exactly winning people over. The only move left is the one Romneyland has already admitted won't work: a desperate VP pick to shake up the campaign, "boost" the candidate, rally the base, and hope to hell that this time, somehow, it will work out differently for the Romney/Ryan ticket than it did for the McCain/Palin ticket. Will the risky strategy fail Romney, just as it failed McCain? You betcha.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345228024000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 14:27:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345228104000-46</Id><Title>Romneyann dreamboat plan</Title><Msg>all aboard the dreamboat !!

What's the opposite of "bump"? Et tu, Rasmussen? The Paul Ryan decision was made on the 11th. The GOP's favorite pollster, Rasmussen, saw a meager two-point bump in its daily tracking poll following the Ryan pick (the 12-14 sample, which was the first one to fully cover post-announcement days). But before the week was up, that two-point bump was quickly followed by a five-point swing toward Obama. Some honeymoon. Of course this is Rasmussen. Tomorrow's results could be Romney 57, Obama 40 and no one would blink. But when the GOP's own propaganda pollster can't pretend that Ryan has given his ticket a sustained bounce, and in fact shows the opposite, it merely reinforces just how awful Mitt Romney's vice-presidential pick truly was.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345228764000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 14:39:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345228775000-48</Id><Title>Next stop for the S&amp;P is 1550</Title><Msg>but I could be wrong... tdc</Msg><Username>tradedotcom</Username><Timestamp>1345228775000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 14:39:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345228844000-49</Id><Topic><Title>What's wif all the bullets?</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1345128874000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:54:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;&lt;Bidder, you live in Riverside.

Now I suppose you are too cheap to tip above that and the waitress loses money, (has to "get by") plus we tip 15 to 20%,depending on service and I don't care if she declares anything if she gets around it - my/our money - not the governments!!! In some states the tip is automatically, like in Europe added into the bill (read the fine print, mostly at 15%) and usually the customer leaves the change - shows me "how well traveled" you are! A waitress at my friends establishment, the Village Inn, makes tips any where from minimum $100/day and to 300+ on a Packer game day, baseball hockey, nascar or what have you!

Then you aren't f--cking QUALIFIED to be a president!!! Romney Adviser: It's 'Politically Unwise' To Campaign In Specifics So far, putting Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) on presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's ticket hasn't led to any detailed plans for his top issue, the budget. That won't change, according to a Romney aide who spoke to Politico. "The nature of running a presidential campaign is that you're communicating direction to the American people," a Romney adviser, who is not named, told Politico. "Campaigns that are about specifics, particularly in today's environment, get tripped up." The issue of the budget, particularly taxes and cuts to entitlement programs, is a pivotal one for the election and is one both campaigns are trying to exploit. For the Romney campaign, that has meant accusing President Barack Obama of decimating Medicare by taking funds from it for his health care law, even though that is a false claim. Ryan's own budget would transform the program to make it almost unrecognizable. Another Romney official, also unnamed, told Politico the campaign isn't scared to talk about Medicare. "We'll do it for as long as they want," the official said. "Let's do it." That doesn't mean talking in specifics, however. Romney was vague about his budget plans during the Republican primary -- he said he would cut funding to Planned Parenthood but not much else -- and will continue to be, according to the adviser. Seriously! We can't ask about this a--hole's past tax returns. We can't ask about this d----bag's one term in the only election he has ever won (governor of Massachusetts), We can't ask about this nitwit's time running the 2002 Olympics AND We can't ask about what this dirtbag's time running Bain. Now We can't ask about the specifics in regards to things that could have a major impact on most of the United States including jobs, medicare, social security and healthcare because *gasp* god forbid we hear the details we'll go screaming into the night as we run to the polls and vote for someone else. GUESS WHAT - this is NOT a f-cking popularity contest. You want to win a popularity contest run for Prom King or Mr. USA or some BS position like that. I'm in my 40s and the choices made by whomever wins could have a major impact on not just my life my millions of people like me. I have the right to know the details so I know I'm voting for the person that has the best interest of me and the other 99% of the USA (those who don't have trust funds to live off of)."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345234975000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:22:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345235770000-66</Id><Title>Biden's brain found</Title><Msg>Prehistoric Human Brain Found Pickled in Bog One of the world's best preserved prehistoric human brains was recently found in a waterlogged U.K. pit. The brain belonged to an Iron Age man who was hanged and then decapitated, with his head falling in the pit shortly thereafter. Scientists believe that submersion in liquid, anoxic environments helps to preserve human brain tissue. A human skull dated to about 2,684 years ago with an "exceptionally preserved" human brain still inside of it was recently discovered in a waterlogged U.K. pit, according to a new Journal of Archaeological Science study.

AlterNet [1] / By William K. Black [2] comments_image Bill Black: Slate's William Saletan Epitomizes Media's Bizarre Infatuation with Paul Ryan August 17, 2012 | William Saletan has written a column [3] that epitomizes the media’s bizarre infatuation with Paul Ryan. Saletan entitles his piece “Why I Love Paul Ryan.” His intro summarizes his attraction to Ryan: “He’s what a Republican should be: an honest, open-minded, solution-oriented fiscal conservative.” Here is how Saletan attempts to show that Ryan is worthy of his unconditional love. “Ryan is a real fiscal conservative. He isn’t just another Tea-Party ideologue spouting dogma about less government and the magic of free enterprise. He has actually crunched the numbers and laid out long-term budget proposals. My liberal friends point out that Ryan’s plan leaves many details unclear. That’s true. But show me another Republican who has addressed the nation’s fiscal problems as candidly and precisely as Ryan has. He’s got the least detailed budget proposal out there, except for all the others.” Ryan is the leading Tea Party ideologue. He is an Ayn Rand devotee. (His attempts to deny that prove that he is dishonest.) No, he did not “actually crunch[] the numbers and la[y] out long-term budget proposals.” You may read reports that the Ryan budget plan achieves a balanced budget in 2040. That is not correct. He created fantasy numbers, instructed the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to suspend disbelief (and its normal methodology, which actually crunches the numbers) and treat the fantasy numbers as real. He had to order the CBO to accept his fictional, numbingly over-optimistic numbers as reality in order to achieve a faux balanced budget nearly three decades from now. Absent the fictions his non-budget never eliminates the deficit. Ryan’s deliberate misuse of the CBO to attempt to lend credibility to partisan fantasy numbers is a cynical act of dishonesty. The CBO issued this warning about Ryan’s manipulation of the budget estimation process. At the request of the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, Congressman Paul Ryan, the Congressional Budget Office [4] (CBO) has calculated the long-term budgetary impact of paths for federal revenues and spending specified by the Chairman and his staff. The calculations presented here represent CBO’s assessment of how the specified paths would alter the trajectories of federal debt, revenues, spending, and economic output relative to the trajectories under two scenarios that CBO has analyzed previously. Those calculations do not represent a cost estimate for legislation or an analysis of the effects of any given policies. In particular, CBO has not considered whether the specified paths are consistent with the policy proposals or budget figures released today by Chairman Ryan as part of his proposed budget resolution.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345243909000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:51:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345244032000-88</Id><Topic><Title>What's Ryan's excuse?</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345243909000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:51:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The amounts of revenues and spending to be used in these calculations for 2012 through 2022 were provided by Chairman Ryan and his staff. Even that was not sufficient to make Ryan’s budget “work” so he left huge blanks in his non-budget, e.g., tax revenues, where he wished away the budgetary difficulties he claims to be resolving. Saletan’s defense of Ryan’s putative wonkiness consists of two arguments that do not pass even the most basic logic tests. First, he tries to diminish the Ryan’s fantasy numbers and budgetary black holes with the concession that “Ryan’s plan leaves many details unclear.” No, it leaves massive, core budget numbers blank or created by make believe. Ryan made up the numbers and knew that he had to order the CBO to suspend disbelief and its normal methodology and to repeat after him: “I do believe in Fairies!” Ryan is presenting a Tinker Bell budget. (Paul Krugman has long emphasized that austerity proponents rely on the claim that austerity will make the “Confidence Fairy” appear and simultaneously reduce the deficit and spur a recovery. The invisible Confidence Fairy, sadly, has failed to show up in Europe. Austerity has thrown the Eurozone back into recession and much of the periphery into depression.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345244032000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:53:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345244081000-89</Id><Topic><Title>What's Ryan's excuse?</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345243909000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:51:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>.) Second, Saletan says that because Ryan’s budgetary non-plan specifies more numbers than any other Republican non-plan he’s the least dishonest Republican. That is quite an indictment of the Republican Party (and Saletan is a Republican), but it is still a huge slam on Ryan’s candor and competence. Saletan then states that he loves Ryan because he exposes the budget lies of the Democratic Party. Ryan refutes the Democratic Party’s bogus arguments. He knows that our domestic spending trajectory is unsustainable and that liberals who fail to get it under control are leading their constituents over a cliff, just like in Europe. Eventually, you can’t borrow enough money to make good on your promises, and everyone’s screwed. Ryan understands that the longer we ignore the debt crisis and postpone serious budget cuts—the liberal equivalent of denying global warming—the more painful the reckoning will be. There’s nothing compassionate about that kind of irresponsibility. OK, right idea – Europe has just run an experiment with austerity. It was a disaster. It has thrown the Eurozone back into recession. This is what even mainstream economists predicted. We should learn from that experiment and not mimic their foolishness. But Saletan, Ryan, and Romney all want us to follow Berlin’s failed strategy. In fairness, Romney has twice strayed from his message and admitted that austerity at this time would throw the U.S. back into recession. He quickly fled from candor when his honesty about austerity led Republicans to denounce him. Saletan’s simile (“just like in Europe”) is premised on the twin false assertions that European nations caused the Great Recession by adopting an “unsustainable” “domestic spending trajectory” and his version of Angela Merkel’s claim that “there is no alternative” to austerity. Saletan’s version is that any alternative policy constitutes “leading their constituents over a cliff.” The reality is that nations like Ireland, Iceland, and Spain had several years of budget surpluses as their massive frauds and bubbles grew. Conservatives regularly praised these nations as the exemplars of neo-liberal rectitude, including fiscal responsibility, and success. Severe recessions and depressions cause huge budget deficits – not the other way around. Even Greece is primarily a story of the criminal refusal of their wealthiest elites to pay their taxes. The Ryan and Romney non-budgets recreate aspects of Greece’s fiscal policies by sharply cutting taxes for the wealthiest Americans (shifting the tax burden toward the working class and exacerbating income and political inequality) and asserting that cutting taxes for the wealthy will increase tax revenues – massively. The CBO, under normal “scoring” rules would have rejected Ryan’s fantasy assumptions about his tax cuts.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345244081000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:54:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345244187000-90</Id><Topic><Title>What's Ryan's excuse?</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345243909000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:51:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Saletan knows that Ryan is not a “fiscal conservative” on taxes, but a quasi-Greek politician protecting the wealthiest citizens from paying even a remotely fair share of taxes. [Ryan] has serious flaws. His discipline on spending isn’t matched by restraint on tax cuts. He was wrong to oppose the Simpson-Bowles plan. Democrats will hammer him on the tax side, and he’ll deserve it. The CBO also would have normally rejected Ryan’s claims that he would slash spending to levels that would (if you credit his claim that he would “protect” defense spending and Romney’s promise to increase defense spending) essentially eliminate federal spending for virtually all non-entitlement spending. Saletan knows that Ryan’s claims that he would eliminate virtually all discretionary domestic spending is false (and Saletan would be horrified by the results if Ryan’s claims were true). Saletan says that he loves Ryan because Ryan would cut defense sharply, but Ryan and Romney have subsequently declared defense off limit for budget cuts and Romney has promised to increase defense spending. Saletan rests his final basis for his love of Ryan on a creation myth: “But this is why God made Republicans: to force a reality check when Democrats overpromise and overspend.” Ryan voted for Bush’s (as Saletan defines these terms) “overpromise[ing] and overspend[ing].” Note that Saletan has again conveniently forgotten about the revenue side – where Ryan consistently voted in favor of Bush’s tax cuts for the wealthy that produced large budget deficits. Under his own creation myth, Saletan should hate Ryan as a traitor to God’s plan for Republicans. Ryan consistently failed “to force a reality check” on Bush.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345244187000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:56:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345244224000-91</Id><Topic><Title>What's Ryan's excuse?</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345243909000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:51:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was also Bush’s anti-regulatory policies (compounding Clinton’s anti-regulatory policies) and support for perverse executive and professional compensation that combined to form the criminogenic environment that led to the epidemic of mortgage fraud that hyper-inflated the bubble, drove the financial crisis, and caused the Great Recession and the large deficits. Ryan and Romney were enthusiastic supporters of each of the perverse structures that caused the crisis and the deficits. The Republicans never forced a “reality check” when the banks’ senior officers became wealthy by causing “their” banks to make and purchase millions of fraudulent liar’s loans annually. The Three “R’s” – Romney, Ryan, and Republicans – inhabited Never Never Land throughout the developing crisis. The budgets they created and supported were invariably Tinker Bell fantasy budgets. Ryan’s faux budget is not the work of a green eye-shaded accountant crunching the real numbers. Ryan found it so much more convenient to create fantasy numbers that had no basis in reality but aided his political ambition and his devotion to Ayn Rand’s devotion to Social Darwinism. The great thing about being the Chair of the House Budget Committee is that Ryan could order the CBO to assume that the fantasy numbers he invented were true. For someone who (1) was wealthy and wished to minimize his taxes, (2) whose principal donors were extraordinarily wealthy and wished to minimize their taxes, (3) who was an Ayn Rand devotee who believed that taxing the rich was an illegitimate confiscation of their wealth, and (4) had touted the “supply sider” nostrum that reducing taxes on the wealthy increases tax revenues the ability to order the CBO to accept his assertion that sharply reducing taxes on the wealthy would increase tax revenues was a dream come true. It is easy to understand why Ryan abused the CBO process to create faux legitimacy for his faux budget. It is difficult to see why even the most credulous journalist would be taken in by such a transparent abuse premised on self-serving fantasy numbers and deliberate disrespect for the truth. Then there’s the matter of Ryan’s track record. His predictions about Bush’s tax cuts and the resultant deficits have consistently been proven to be embarrassingly wrong and his endorsement of Europe’s austerity dogma has proven disastrous. Ryan’s batting average would get him fired at a Single A minor league team.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345244224000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:57:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345247087000-92</Id><Title>Yup, She's a spitter</Title><Msg>What a shame, she's probably been a spitter her entire adult life.

You DON'T want to balance the budget, especially when you're running a large trade deficit. Instant recession, unless you have a massive credit bubble that can mask it for awhile. All this talk about it being unsustainable, we've been in a constant state of budget deficits and inflation since the Great Depression... and its the major reason why the economy has been relatively smooth since then. That, and the regulation of banks. Just look back at US history, we averaged a recession or depression less then every 3 years. If you fail to learn from history you are doomed to repeat it. History has shown the economy continually gets ravaged by a lack of control of the money supply. If you want your economy to run smoothly you need to have a measured, continual increase in the money supply, that means running deficits and regulating banks so they don't screw things up by lending too much and then cutting back. And always remember that, although money makes economic transactions infinitely more efficient then any other method of trade, it is not real. Nobody makes money, they make goods and services which they exchange for money. And when your economy is run by something that is entirely fictional, you better make sure you understand that fiction and have good control over it.</Msg><Username>briguy260</Username><Timestamp>1345259292000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 23:08:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345259825000-99</Id><Topic><Title>What's Ryan's excuse?</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345243909000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:51:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one is really serious about balancing the budget, relax.
