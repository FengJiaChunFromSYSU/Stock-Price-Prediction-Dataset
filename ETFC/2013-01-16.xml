Making subsequent budget cuts by reducing military forces was done during HW Bush's presidency, cutting to what would be needed in a post Soviet world. The subsequent cuts in our military preparedness were so foolish that when called upon to fulfill just PART of the post Soviet requirement our military almost collapsed. Now we're cutting it further. The reason we're cutting it is that due to wording in Congressional law its about the only thing that Congress is ALLOWED to cut without reworking major entitlement program which, along with debt service, take up the VAST bulk of the Federal Budget. You'll never begin to address the budget until you first take a long hard look at all unearned entitlements and eliminate those that are duplicated programs, or spend too much money to do little to no good. Then we have to look at increasing that rate of return until the programs that are left are those that are effective. Let's take Head Start. Great intentions, but the program doesn't work, and certainly doesn't work well enough to justify its budget, yet Republicans hold it up like its their own grandkid. And what was Bush II thinking adding a Prescription Drug mandate to Medicare? It ended up costing less than what was predicted by its worst detractors, but its still not cheap. It's not just the liberals that like to spend money. Our last "conservative" President spent and acted more like a Wilsonian Democrat, and to have a Socialist follow that is very very reminiscent of the decades between World War One and World War Two. Though, depression aside, they were some interesting decades.

The valuation the government required they use to provision against losses underestimated the value of the property itself. Now they are over provisioned and have assets more valuable than previously estimated. The downspike in real estate in most areas (save perhaps Las Vegas, where I have a timeshare, thankfully already paid for), was temporary. Once the speculators left the market taking their losses with them sanity began to return. Couple that with a treasury policy that makes mortgages comparatively cheap right now and you naturally have a housing recovery. Once that happens values of existing properties begin to return and previously "under water" mortgages find themselves in a positive equity situation that may allow them to refinance, etc, etc, etc . . .</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358367972623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:26:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358368066640-16</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC upgraded target 11$</Title><Username>frwtrade</Username><Timestamp>1358250358704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 06:45:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That target is short, way short.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358368066640</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 15:27:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358368924895-17</Id><Topic><Title>E*Trade's Loan Portfolio</Title><Username>mr_brightside_xy</Username><Timestamp>1358364607240</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 14:30:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am directly involved in Southern California real estate and can tell you that it's a major bounce off the bottom, easily 25% here.

Bob Schieffer Likens Obama taking on the gun lobby to Hunt for Bin Laden, and Defeating the Nazis. Bob Schieffer somehow topped Chris Matthews during CBS News's special coverage of President Obama's gun control press conference on Wednesday, as he became the worst caricature of a foaming-at-the-mouth cheerleader for the chief executive. Schieffer lauded "one of the best speeches I've ever heard him deliver", and compared Obama's new gun control agenda to Lyndon Johnson's push for civil rights legislation in the 1960s. BOB SCHIEFFER: ...Let's remember: there was considerable opposition when Lyndon Johnson went to the Congress and...presented some of the most comprehensive civil rights legislation in the history of this country. Most people told him he couldn't get it done, but he figured out a way to do it. And that's what Barack Obama is going to have to do...what happened in Newtown was probably the worst day in this country's history since 9/11. We found Osama bin Laden. We tracked him down. We changed the way that we dealt with that problem. Surely, finding Osama bin Laden; surely, passing civil rights legislation, as Lyndon Johnson was able to do; and before that, surely, defeating the Nazis, was a much more formidable task than taking on the gun lobby.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358371433858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 16:23:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358372032055-19</Id><Topic><Title>This why you can't take the liberal media seriously</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358371433858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 16:23:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's 75...

Attorney General Eric Holder gave the same answer when asked the same question a few weeks before. After so many months of scandal and scrutiny, it seems hard to believe the Attorney General still can’t—or won’t—answer this simple question. As NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told Fox News’ Lou Dobbs in June, “The administration needs to stop the cover-up,” adding, “Either they were doing this to prop up a political agenda of sending thousands of guns across the border and blaming it on American gun laws . . . or they were completely incompetent.” Either way, those who approved this operation, and all those who should have known about it and failed to stop it, are responsible for the operation’s horrendous outcome. And that certainly includes Attorney General Holder. At the core of this scandal is the effort to politicize BATFE’s law enforcement activities and to take advantage of yet another crisis to achieve a political agenda: the passage of new gun control laws.</Msg><Username>president_schittstain</Username><Timestamp>1358384198725</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 19:56:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358384995223-29</Id><Topic><Title>Obama needs you this Saturday?</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358373770992</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 17:02:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many liberals are considering helping. they are patting themselves on the back and sharing their goodness with anyone who will listen.
