In all, 51 percent of Americans now express explicit anti-black attitudes, compared with 48 percent in a similar 2008 survey. When measured by an implicit racial attitudes test, the number of Americans with anti-black sentiments jumped to 56 percent, up from 49 percent during the last presidential election. In both tests, the share of Americans expressing pro-black attitudes fell. "As much as we'd hope the impact of race would decline over time ... it appears the impact of anti-black sentiment on voting is about the same as it was four years ago," said Jon Krosnick, a Stanford University professor who worked with AP to develop the survey. Most Americans expressed anti-Hispanic sentiments, too. In an AP survey done in 2011, 52 percent of non-Hispanic whites expressed anti-Hispanic attitudes. That figure rose to 57 percent in the implicit test. The survey on Hispanics had no past data for comparison.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1351358473504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 13:21:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351358477825-26</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals are Racists</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1322841595000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-12-02 10:59:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's all the intellect they scounge up</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351358477825</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 13:21:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351358652827-27</Id><Topic><Title>Jim Crow laws are back</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1310247754000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2011-07-09 17:42:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Col Lawrence Wilkerson says the Republican part is filled with racists..

Colin Powell endorsed President Obama because he’s black. But this isn’t the first time Sununu or even Mitt Romney’s campaign have introduced Obama’s race into the election. The former New Hampshire governor has repeatedly suggested that Obama or his policies are “foreign,” European, and something less than American. Here are some of his greatest hits: – Obama is foreign. Obama doesn’t understand the “American system” because “he spent his early years in Hawaii smoking something, spent the next set of years in Indonesia, another set of years in Indonesia, and, frankly, when he came to the U.S. he worked as a community organizer, which is a socialized structure.” [Fox News, 7/17/2012] – Obama doesn’t know how to be an American. During a conference call, Sununu claimed, “The men and women all over America who have worked hard to build these businesses, their businesses, from the ground up is how our economy became the envy of the world. It is the American way. And I wish this president would learn how to be an American.” [Conference call, 7/17/2012] – Obama is a lazy idiot. Sununu described Obama’s debate performance as “babbling,” “lazy,” and “disengaged,” and dismissed the possibility that he could do better in the future. “When you’re not that bright you can’t get better prepared.” [Fox News, 10/4/2012] – Obama has no class, just wants to be cool. “That moment of using the #$%$. word was kind of a self-defining moment for the president,” he told Sean Hannity. “No class, wants to be cool. Sacrifices the dignity of the presidency for appearing cool to a magazine that works for some of his base.” [Fox News, 10/25/2012] Romney has never publicly rebuked Sununu’s racial remarks, though Sununu has previously issued retractions of some of his statements. With just 11 days before Election Day, he remains the campaign’s most prominent spokesperson and is even attacking Obama for dividing Americans along racial lines. During an appearance on Fox News on Thursday he complained that Obama has instituted “class warfare,” adding, “This guy has tried to create some racial divides.”</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1351360448459</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 13:54:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351361027659-30</Id><Title>Paul Ryan has been getting Gv't checks since he was 16, no wonder he's so sensitive</Title><Msg>"WASHINGTON -- In late September 2011, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker's office notified Rep. Paul Ryan's office with some good news. The U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs had awarded a grant to a Wisconsin veteran's home to help renovate its water distribution system. Walker's office just needed Ryan's people to sign off on the press release. But what started out as a routine matter quickly turned into a minor panic among aides to the two Republicans. Wendy Riemann, Walker's director of federal relations, sent an email to Ryan's communications director, Kevin Seifert, asking for a quote from the congressman. "Not sure if you're doing your own release, etc.," Riemann emailed on Sept. 26. "Let me know -- we'll wait to hear from you either way before putting it out." Seifert replied with a simple message: Stop the presses. He had one concern. Could the grant be tied to federal stimulus funds? "Not to create more work for you all but -- do you have any idea where the money for this grant came from? Was it from the stimulus/the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act?" Seifert wrote. "Our concern is that if it's stimulus funds, we won't want to highlight (and would think you guys wouldn't either)." Seifert did not want Ryan appearing to support President Barack Obama. "The Administration is encouraging lots of agencies to spend un-spent stimulus funds and we generally won't do press on things we actively oppose," the congressman's communications director concluded. The emails were obtained by The Huffington Post through a public records request with Walker's office. The email exchange underscored a routine problem facing Republicans in the House of Representatives at the time. Having opposed the president's stimulus bill publicly, many (including some of the foremost conservatives) privately concluded that the legislation did some good in their districts. But rather than back off their opposition, or risk charges of hypocrisy -- even for something as mundane and worthy as a veteran's home water system upgrade -- they did what they could to secure money without public notice. Seifert's worry in September 2011 was prescient. During the recent vice presidential debate, Vice President Joe Biden chided Ryan for asking for stimulus funds. Ryan had sought stimulus funds for four projects, including two involving Environmental Protection Agency funds. The congressman routinely sought grant money for projects in Wisconsin's 1st Congressional District, which encompasses his hometown of Janesville. He sought EPA grant money for environmental studies of potentially hazardous industrial lands, and for clean diesel fuel assistance for a school association. Ryan's spokesman Brendan Buck told HuffPost several weeks ago that the requests amounted to basic constituent services. "Part of being a congressman is vouching for constituents and helping them navigate the federal bureaucracy when asked," Buck said. Ryan received a $735,000 earmark to construct a bus transit center in Janesville while slamming the practice. In 2008, he sought a moratorium on earmark spending. The next day, after researching the veteran's home grant, Riemann, in Walker's office, emailed Seifert, Ryan's communications director, with what she discovered. The grant came from federal funds from an annual appropriation -- not the stimulus bill. But there was one potential caveat. "My Google shows there was an audit for this work with recovery funds ... but it also looks like this grant program has been around for awhile," she wrote. Too risky, Seifert suggested. "Feel free to proceed without us on this one," he said. "Thanks for checking."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1351361027659</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:03:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351361522123-31</Id><Topic><Title>Angry Dumbo (LOSING!!!)</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351185719373</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 13:21:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mean sicko!!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351361522123</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:12:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351361705811-32</Id><Topic><Title>President Romney in 10 Days!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351349451910</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 10:50:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go on sub-human lefty losers...Make My Day!!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351361705811</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:15:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351361720864-33</Id><Title>Colin Powell "troubled" by Dipshidiot's foreign policy and neocon advisers</Title><Msg>Colin Powell On Romney: ‘I Have Concerns About His Views On Foreign Policy’ By Ben Armbruster on Oct 25, 2012 at 8:49 am Colin Powell Former Secretary of State Gen. Colin Powell endorsed President Obama’s re-election campaign this morning on CBS This Morning. Powell — who served as the top U.S. diplomat during the Bush administration — said the president would be better on the economy but he also had harsh criticism of Mitt Romney’s foreign policy, reiterating his concern about Romney’s neocon advisers and that the GOP presidential nominee essentially threw out all his past hawkish positions and played a moderate during this week’s foreign policy debate: POWELL: Not only am I uncomfortable with what Governor Romney is proposing for his economic plan, I have concerns about his views on foreign policy. The governor who was speaking on Monday night at the debate was saying things that were quite different from what he said earlier so I’m not quite sure which governor Romney we would be getting with respect to foreign policy. O’DONNELL: What concerns do you have with governor Romney’s foreign policy? POWELL: Well it’s hard to fix it, I mean it’s a moving target, one day he has a certain strong view about staying in Afghanistan but then on Monday night he agrees with the withdrawal, the same thing in Iraq and almost every issue that was discussed on Monday night, governor Romney agreed with the president with some nuances but this is quite a different set of foreign policy views than he had earlier in the campaign and my concern which I’ve expressed previously in a public way is that sometimes I don’t sense he has thought through these issues as thoroughly as he should have and he gets advice from his campaign staff that he then has to adjust or modify as they go along. ROSE: Are you concerned about the people that are advising governor Romney? POWELL: I think there are some very very strong neoconservative views that are presented by the governor that I have some trouble with. Watch the clip: Back in May, Powell took issue with Romney’s characterization of Russia as America’s “number one geopolitical foe.” “Come on Mitt,” Powell said, “think.” The former Secretary of State also said at the time that he was concerned with who is advising Romney on foreign policy. “I’ve seen some of the names and some of them are quite far to the right and sometimes I think they might be in a position to make judgements or recommendations to the candidate that should get a second thought,” he said. But Powell noticed the obvious during the presidential foreign policy debate this week. The Mitt Romney whose “instinct is to call to the Cheney-ites” on foreign policy issues was nowhere to be found. “Despite Romney’s momentary embrace of President Obama’s policies [during the debate],” CAP’s Matt Duss wrote this week, “we should still be concerned with the role that neoconservatives would play in a Romney administration.”</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1351361720864</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:15:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351361786387-34</Id><Topic><Title>Liberals are Racists</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1322841595000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2011-12-02 10:59:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Same Liberals..Same Racism!!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351361786387</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:16:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351361837502-35</Id><Topic><Title>BENGHAZI Cover-up and $6 Gas???</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351110977305</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-24 16:36:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>My Chinese Jeep can't have $6 Dumbo gas!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351361837502</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:17:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351361978641-36</Id><Topic><Title>rich republican helps a poor republican</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1351358887371</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 13:28:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's that idiot Billie!!</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1351361978641</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:19:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351362166199-37</Id><Title>Dumbo Still Lying on Benghazi!!!</Title><Msg>More C.I.A. info to attack Dumbo coming out later today..
