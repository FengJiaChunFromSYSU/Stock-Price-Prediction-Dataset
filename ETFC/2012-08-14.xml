It carries more weight with Indie's. Paul Ryan's fairy tale budget Mr. Ryan professes to be a defense hawk, though the true conservatives of modern times — Calvin Coolidge, Herbert C. Hoover, Robert A. Taft, Dwight D. Eisenhower, even Gerald R. Ford — would have had no use for the neoconconservative imperialism that the G.O.P. cobbled from policy salons run by Irving Kristol’s ex-Trotskyites three decades ago. These doctrines now saddle our bankrupt nation with a roughly $775 billion “defense” budget in a world where we have no advanced industrial state enemies and have been fired (appropriately) as the global policeman. Indeed, adjusted for inflation, today’s national security budget is nearly double Eisenhower’s when he left office in 1961 (about $400 billion in today’s dollars) — a level Ike deemed sufficient to contain the very real Soviet nuclear threat in the era just after Sputnik. By contrast, the Romney-Ryan version of shrinking Big Government is to increase our already outlandish warfare-state budget and risk even more spending by saber-rattling at a benighted but irrelevant Iran. .................... The Ryan Plan boils down to a fetish for cutting the top marginal income-tax rate for “job creators” — i.e. the superwealthy — to 25 percent and paying for it with an as-yet-undisclosed plan to broaden the tax base. Of the $1 trillion in so-called tax expenditures that the plan would attack, the vast majority would come from slashing popular tax breaks for employer-provided health insurance, mortgage interest, 401(k) accounts, state and local taxes, charitable giving and the like, not to mention low rates on capital gains and dividends. The crony capitalists of K Street already own more than enough Republican votes to stop that train before it leaves the station. In short, Mr. Ryan’s plan is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices. And it couldn’t pass even if Republicans were to take the presidency and both houses of Congress. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have no plan to take on Wall Street, the Fed, the military-industrial complex, social insurance or the nation’s fiscal calamity and no plan to revive capitalist prosperity — just empty sermons.

Stockman, who was the director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1981 to 1985, is the author of the forthcoming book “The Great Deformation: How Crony Capitalism Corrupts Free Markets and Democracy.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344968346000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:19:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344969458000-56</Id><Topic><Title>Pick a direction for America</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344876997000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 12:56:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>rodent, Paul Ryan benefits from entitlements he wants to `fix' Obama, Ryan clash on fundamental ideas" (Page A1, Aug. 13) The GOP believes it has its deficit doctor.

Paul D. Ryan was railing against President Obama’s $787 billion stimulus package as a “wasteful spending spree,” he wrote at least four letters to Obama’s secretary of energy asking that millions of dollars from the program be granted to a pair of Wisconsin conservation groups, according to documents obtained by the Globe. The advocacy appeared to pay off; both groups were awarded the economic recovery funds -- one receiving a $20 million grant to help thousands of local businesses and homes improve their energy efficiency, agency documents show. Ryan’s letters to the energy secretary praising the energy initiatives as he sought a portion of the funding are in sharp contrast to the House Budget Committee chairman’s image as a Tea Party favorite adamantly opposed to federal spending on such programs. Ryan’s views are garnering new attention since his selection Saturday as Mitt Romney’s running mate. The documents show that Ryan’s attempts to take advantage of the stimulus funds even after he voted against them was more expansive than previously reported. Ryan was criticized by some House Democrats in 2010 after the Wall Street Journal reported that he was among several Republicans lawmakers who sought the stimulus money for their constituents by, in his case, writing a letter in 2010 to the Department of Labor.

Fox News (correctly) Fact-Checks The Ryan Plan It might be getting hotter here on Earth, but there's an ice storm in Hell. http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/14/fact-check-ryan-budget-plan-doesnt-actually-slash-budget/ Top News Story on Google News, here is the Headline from Fox: Fact Check: Ryan budget plan doesn't actually slash the budget Here are a few little-known facts about Paul Ryan's supposedly slash-and-burn budget plan. Government spending increases almost every year over the next decade. - Tax and other revenue rises year after year. - The 10-year deficit is still $3 trillion. - The fact that Ryan's spending plans grow the federal budget over the long term is one that could easily be lost in the political melee underway in the wake of his selection as Mitt Romney's running mate. To be sure, Ryan is proposing major changes to Medicare and taxation that Democrats see as problematic. But claims that Ryan is slashing spending don't quite square with the numbers. Those claims are convenient Washington shorthand for what Ryan's plan actually proposes -- which is to slow the rate of budget growth, but still allow the budget to grow. ... While claims that Ryan is slashing the budget are questionable, there are studies to back up claims that the Republicans' tax plan benefits the wealthy more than others. Most damning part of this: Tax revenue *increases*, budget grows, deficit stays, AND the wealthy get huge tax cuts. Who is giving more to the government under the Ryan plan again? Oh right... the poor and middle class.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344971005000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:03:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344971208000-63</Id><Topic><Title>immoral &amp; lunatic gop want to increase this spending</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1344962477000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 12:41:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Since when it is immoral to spend money on defense?

CNN (CNN) -- Actor Ron Palillo, who played class clown Arnold Horshack on the 1970s television comedy "Welcome Back, Kotter," has died at age 63, his agent said Tuesday. Palillo died of a heart attack in the Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, area, where he had moved to live near his mother and was active in the theater, his agent, Scott Stander, told CNN. He was best known for his role as one of the "Sweathogs" -- remedial students at a Brooklyn high school -- on the 1975-79 show, which starred Gabe Kaplan and launched the career of fellow Sweathog John Travolta. Palillo's "Oooh! Oooh!" appeals for attention became the character's catchphrase.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344972298000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:24:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344972314000-68</Id><Title>weird gop distinctions</Title><Msg>gop is ok with engineers paid with tax dollars to study mars rocks.....billions of dollars, btw. but they whine about engineers who got paid with tax dollars to develop solar technology.... millions of dollars... i think developing solar and other alternate power sources is far more important to the USA than mars rocks. and keep in mind how other countries are killing us in jobs and earnings because they invest in research.... the japanese government developed the battery for the prius.... and THEY reap the tens of thosands of jobs and billions in sales...... ditto for china and germany on solar....</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1344972314000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 15:25:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344972662000-69</Id><Title>Added more at $8.61 and will add more at $8.60 if it falls again!!</Title><Msg>Added more at $8.61 and will add more at $8.60 if it falls again!!

Now, when Ryan was 16, it's not just a tragic event and at that time there was no reason for him to turn down the entitlement, as anybody else would have taken it - times have changed since then - they got tight! SS is in the same trouble as Medicare - lets go there, because one can do without SS, but Medicare failure will kill people! There are only two ways for the MEDICARE system as it stands now: #1. Do nothing, as OBIMBO does and let it go broke so NOBODY has future benefits! (He has NO plan and even want's to drain more in to MEDICAID, which NOBODY here takes! #2. Educate the future recipients as to how to save the system and PLAN ahead for the future! #3. The OBIMBOCRATS quit scaring the current recipients and people over 55 and present a plan for the persons under 55, OBIMBOCARE is NOT the answer and will go down in flames! I watched a business woman today which said that she will have to down size her company to 49 employees and rather pay a penalty (which is cheaper then the OBIMBO "Taxes")! Also she has to find a new way to distribute her product to the ware houses since the independent, small truckers had to shut down and she can't pay the UNION trucker costs! Now then, lets hear how your opinion as to how to fix that mess!
