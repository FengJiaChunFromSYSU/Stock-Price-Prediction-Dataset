They only work within the metro area, and they aren't really great phones, but if you're just going to throw it away when you're done with it, who cares? As for the person who sold it, generally to a middleman from whom you buy it, they just claim to have lost it or had it stolen, pay a minimal fee, and get a new one. Meaning your burner is good for maybe, 4, 5 days tops before you ditch it. Drug dealers LOVE this program as it's even more anonymous than sending a cousin in to an electronics store to buy a half dozen burner phones.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1360751208281</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 05:26:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360759616833-4</Id><Topic><Title>Buy On Dip</Title><Username>madelinegarcia842</Username><Timestamp>1326931323000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-01-18 19:02:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Am surprised with their analysis!</Msg><Username>edwardantony835</Username><Timestamp>1360759616833</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 07:46:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360761289623-5</Id><Topic><Title>American Mid-Cap Financials With Strong Free Cash Flow</Title><Username>sharronroyeqgjdxw8144</Username><Timestamp>1308154581000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2011-06-15 12:16:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great call!</Msg><Username>edwardantony835</Username><Timestamp>1360761289623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 08:14:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360763325304-6</Id><Topic><Title>The California Rambo is Going Out in a Blaze!...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1360705133670</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 16:38:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guess he didn't want to go out with a bang...</Msg><Username>eagles03711</Username><Timestamp>1360763325304</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 08:48:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360763579418-7</Id><Title>until now, violence against women was legal</Title><Msg>apparently.

Recovery Sign: More People Quitting Their Jobs December had the fewest layoffs since the government began tracking the data in 2000. Also, the most people quit their jobs during the month since June 2008, another sign that job growth and consumer confidence may start to pick up steam this year. "These points go against the popular notion that the economy ground to a halt while DC negotiated the Fiscal Cliff late last year, and supports the hope domestic labor markets can continue to improve in 2013," wrote Beth Reed of ConvergEx Group, whose strategy team wrote about the Bureau of Labor Statistics data in a report to clients Wednesday. "If lawmakers can reach consensus in Washington and allow businesses a sense of economic stability, then job growth might actually accelerate," she added. Layoffs totaled 1.57 million in December, the fewest since the BLS started releasing the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey in 2000. The data showed 2.16 million people quit their jobs, representing 53 percent of all job separations when one accounts for those that just retired, according to ConvergEx. "Our 'Take this Job and Shove It" indicator of current/future consumer confidence hit a recovery high," stated Reed. "You're not going to quit your job if you have no faith in your own economic status."</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360784988581</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 14:49:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360785879036-15</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC nearing 52-wk high</Title><Username>gorakrishna</Username><Timestamp>1360778608362</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 13:03:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Protect your position with a decent "stop" from a "sell off" because this is about the time when Citadel dumps millions of ETFC shares.

Add to that even with his best efforts to "soak the rich", to the contrary they have even gotten "richer" under his reign of social justice. So far here is the results from his attempt at redistributing wealth...The poor get a free phone, the middle class gets much higher health costs, and the rich get new Gulfstream Jets. In Age of Spending Cuts, Making a Case for Government WASHINGTON — Thirty-two years after President Ronald Reagan proclaimed that “government is the problem” and 17 years after President Bill Clinton offered a surrender of sorts on that issue by stating that the “era of big government is over,” President Obama made a case Tuesday night for closing out the politics of austerity. In laying out his agenda, President Obama continued trying to define a 21st-century version of liberalism that could outlast his time in office. In a State of the Union address largely focused on economic themes, he asserted that “we can’t just cut our way to prosperity” and suggested that it is time for a more balanced approach, including accepting that government has a vital role to play in ensuring economic growth and a secure middle class. “Most of us agree that a plan to reduce the deficit must be part of our agenda,” Mr. Obama said. “But let’s be clear: deficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.” In setting out how government could reach what he considers an acceptable level of fiscal stability through Medicare cuts and tax increases, Mr. Obama was doing more than trying to set the terms for the next, fast-approaching rounds in his fiscal cage match with Congressional Republicans. He was also building a broader argument that the nation needs to shift away from the focus on shrinking the government that has dominated politics for the past several years and toward a modestly more activist agenda aimed at tackling persistent inequality and the dislocating forces of a globalized, technology-driven economy.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360791525188</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 16:38:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360791735543-21</Id><Topic><Title>ted nugent, coward , draft dodger and #$%$</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1360790599366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 16:23:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your hero Billy Clinton was also a draft dodger, and he was elected President twice...obviously not a problem with the folks on the left.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360791735543</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 16:42:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360794410148-22</Id><Topic><Title>Obama not man enough to say hi to the Nuge</Title><Username>spam_buster_ir</Username><Timestamp>1360788228012</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 15:43:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Simple.
