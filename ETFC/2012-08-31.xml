Eli B by jbou Boy if you doubted Mitt Romney has what it takes to appeal to wealthy religious Caucasians who would never vote Democratic YOU WERE WRONG Romney: My promise is to help you and your family...into your NEW Climate Change lifeboat! Putin is going to beat up Romney if they ever meet. Mitt Romney: "We don't apologize for success. We don't apologize for firing Americans. We don't apologize for keeping our money offshore." Breaking News: Clint Eastwood is yelling at an invisible Joe Biden standing at a urinal Romney mentioning Neil Armstrong. This must be the death montage. "Know who else was a great American? Sherman Hemsley." You can't run a country like a business. If you did, you'd have to pay profits to investors, meaning citizens.

Vote for Us!" The footage of Eastwood rambling and mumbling to his "Harvey" - President Obama - will be played to audiences a hundred years from now as the Most Bizarre Convention Moment Ever. The people of the future will know nothing about Dirty Harry or Josey Wales or a Million Dollar Baby. They WILL know about the night a crazy old man hijacked a national party's most important gathering so he could tell the President to literally go do something to himself (i.e. ---- himself). In those few moments (and these days, it only takes a few moments—see Anthony Weiner), he completely upended and redefined how he'll be remembered by younger and future generations. A few years ago, at the annual National Board of Review film awards held at Tavern on the Green in New York, I was there to hand out one of the honors. When it came time for Eastwood to accept his, he went up to the microphone and growled to me in front of the audience, "If you ever show up at my house with that camera, I'll shoot you on sight." The audience laughed, I laughed, but the person who issued the threat wasn't laughing. That creeped me out a bit. I made sure never to go stand on Clint Eastwood's lawn. But as I said, the best outcome from the incident last night was that it showed just how out of touch Republicans are these days. It's as if they want a divorce from us, the American mainstream, so they can go live in the land of legitimate rapes and ice caps that don't melt. Most Americans don't live there on Planet Koo-koo, and I don't suspect many will be visiting there any time soon. Thanks, Clint: you made our day!

It's a toss-up whether the funnier part of Clint Eastwood's speech last night was the part where he mumbled at an empty chair, or the part where the Romney campaign bumped its well-produced, reasonably effective bio video off network television to show Clint mumbling. But whichever it is, here we are the next morning, still laughing about it. Twitter was, of course, a steady stream of mockery, and still is. But just as entertaining was watching traditional media types who feel they need to be dignified and neutral trying to contain their shock and come up with ways to describe what they'd just seen. Brian Williams and Andrea Mitchell were a delight, of course. Then there's New York Times' Michael Shear and Michael Barbaro: The actor, in one of the more unusual moments in Republican convention history, offered a speech in which he pretended to have an off-color conversation with an imaginary President Obama sitting by his side in an empty chair. That is actually a masterful sentence and, no joke, I can see why you might need two writers to get to it. Conveying how bizarre Eastwood's appearance was to people who didn't see it is a tall order. Then you've got the responses from the political world, with Obama's campaign practically dancing in glee and Romney's campaign struggling to be upbeat about the whole thing—"His ad libbing was a break from all the political speeches, and the crowd enjoyed it" is the best they could do, really? Obama campaign press secretary Ben LaBolt said he was "Referring all questions on this to Salvador Dali." David Axelrod looked at it as a strategist: “I’m sure in retrospect they would have rather run the film [bio video on Romney] than the filmmaker, but that is their business and we will handle ours a different way,” said Axelrod, referring to the Democratic convention. Ann Romney, too, admitted her husband's campaign might have been better off showing the video or really almost anything else: I think it's important that people do see that side of Mitt. We appreciated Clint's support, of course, but it's so hard to really get a sense of who this person is in such a short amount of time, but yes, I do wish more people had seen those touching moments. In short, Clint Eastwood put David Axelrod and Ann Romney on the same page, only the latter had to strain for gratitude with lines like "He’s a unique guy, and he did a unique thing last night" while the former could just laugh about it. Ann apparently had a little more trouble being poised and diplomatic in the moment, though: Watching Ann Romney during the Eastwood address, according to NPR political correspondent Mara Liasson, was like watching “the mother of the bride listening to a drunken wedding toast.” I don't know about you, but that thought doesn't make me stop laughing.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1346425100200</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:58:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346426220543-10</Id><Topic><Title>GOP surprise speaker</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1346344551895</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 12:35:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>biddermon--I like your suggestion.

For now, however, there is a preliminary injunction in Obama for America v. Husted forbidding the state from eliminating those three days. The meat of the decision: IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in-person early voting IS RESTORED on the three days immediately preceding Election Day for all eligible Ohio voters. And specifically, for the purposes of the 2012 General Election, this Order restores in-person early voting to all eligible Ohio voters on Saturday, November 3, 2012; Sunday, November 4, 2012; and Monday, November 5, 2012. This Court anticipates that Defendant Secretary of State will direct all Ohio elections boards to maintain a specific, consistent schedule on those three days, in keeping with his earlier directive that only by doing so can he ensure that Ohio’s election process is “uniform, accessible for all, fair, and secure.” In 2004, long queues at the polling stations in urban centers may have turned away as many as 174,000 voters, according to one report. Consequently, the state established 35 days of early voting for the 2008 election. It worked. Turnout was substantially increased. Especially on the three early-voting days right before the election and particularly on that Sunday. Tens of thousands of voters turned out that day, many of them African Americans on their way home from church. Ohio Republicans hated the results, which included Barack Obama's win and the Democratic capture of two additional congressional seats from the GOP. Consequently, the GOP-dominated legislature decided to cut back on the number of days available for early voting. The weekend and Monday before the election were their chief target for the ax. The only exceptions were Ohioans covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. One problem, the court ruled, was that the details of the change don't guarantee that UOCAVA citizens would actually get a chance to vote. Hasen notes that the court's ruling stated that removing early voting privileges for all voters except (possibly) the UOCAVA voters violated the Constitution's equal protection clause: From the onset of this litigation, Defendants have pointed to special concerns for the military—concerns all parties share—and the military’s need to maintain additional access to in-person early voting. But for UOCAVA voters, what is left is, potentially, one day: Monday. Defendants have presented no evidence to sustain the inference that in-person early voting on Monday—one day—will burden county boards of elections to the extent that the injury to Plaintiffs is justified. Moreover, Defendants undercut the virtue of their support of military voters by failing to protect any significant measure of UOCAVA voting. Unless a serviceperson is “suddenly deployed” at exactly the right time—enabling in-person voting on Monday—he or she will likely be unable to vote, depending on the local elections board’s “discretion.” That the State cannot justify its interest in foreclosing Ohio voters for one day emphasizes the arbitrary nature of its action. Finally, this Court notes that restoring in-person early voting to all Ohio voters through the Monday before Election Day does not deprive UOCAVA voters from early voting. Instead, and more importantly, it places all Ohio voters on equal standing. If the case is appealed, Hasen believes that the bitter division over voting issues in the Sixth Circuit Court where it would be heard makes predicting the probable outcome no simple matter: There are reasonable arguments over whether the Court picked the right level of scrutiny to apply, and whether the judge applied the scrutiny he said he was applying. Further, there is a major debate about what Bush v. Gore requires, and the Sixth Circuit may have to go en banc to resolve the meaning of the case: does it in fact require (1) equal treatment of all voters in terms of opportunities to vote; and (2) a kind of “non-retrogression” principle, whereby the state may not remove a method of easier voting once it has used it in a past election? For the moment, however, Ohioans get to chalk up a victory in a week that also saw victories for voters in Texas and Florida.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1346448582155</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 17:29:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346449032532-34</Id><Title>Fightin' Harry Reid calls out the dipshidiot</Title><Msg>Fri Aug 31, 2012 at 02:30 PM PDT Reid calls out hypocrisy of Romney's Louisiana tour by Joan McCarter While Pretend-President Romney was touring Louisiana, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reminded reporters of the profound hypocrisy of that trip. “It is the height of hypocrisy for Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan to make a pretense of showing sympathy for the victims of Hurricane Isaac when their policies would leave those affected by this disaster stranded and on their own,” Reid said. “If Paul Ryan and his fellow House Republicans had succeeded in blocking disaster relief last fall, there would have been no aid for the victims of Isaac today. And Paul Ryan’s budget would gut disaster funding, making it much harder to get aid to our fellow Americans in their time of need,” he added. All of which is perfectly true. Last year, House Republicans created yet another crisis over the budget, with emergency disaster funding as their hostage. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was the ringleader in that debacle, backed up by his loyal budget committee chair, Paul Ryan. More to the point, Ryan's major culpability is in his efforts to gut the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency and FEMA in his budgets. Even more to the point of this disaster, he tried to abolish a new fund agreed to by Congress and President Obama that is providing relief in this disaster. He was overruled by his leadership. Ryan's House leadership was smart enough to recognize that gutting emergency funding ended up being a disaster for them and shut Ryan down. Mitt Romney (the guy who turned rising ocean levels into a joke in his acceptance speech) seems to be fine with the idea.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1346449032532</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 17:37:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346449092925-35</Id><Topic><Title>President Romney!!!

Senator Barack Obama (D-Il), then an Illinois state senator, delivered these remarks in October 2002 at the Federal Plaza in Chicago. "I stand before you as someone who is not opposed to war in all circumstances. The Civil War was one of the bloodiest in history, and yet it was only through the crucible of the sword, the sacrifice of multitudes, that we could begin to perfect this union and drive the scourge of slavery from our soil. I Don't Oppose All Wars I don't oppose all wars. My grandfather signed up for a war the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, fought in Patton's army. He fought in the name of a larger freedom, part of that arsenal of democracy that triumphed over evil. I don't oppose all wars. After September 11, after witnessing the carnage and destruction, the dust and the tears, I supported this administration's pledge to hunt down and root out those who would slaughter innocents in the name of intolerance, and I would willingly take up arms myself to prevent such tragedy from happening again. Opposed to Dumb, Rash Wars I don't oppose all wars. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other armchair, weekend warriors in this administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne. What I am opposed to is the attempt by political hacks like Karl Rove to distract us from a rise in the uninsured, a rise in the poverty rate, a drop in the median income, to distract us from corporate scandals and a stock market that has just gone through the worst month since the Great Depression. That's what I'm opposed to. A dumb war. A rash war. A war based not on reason but on passion, not on principle but on politics. On Saddam Hussein Now let me be clear: I suffer no illusions about Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal man. A ruthless man. A man who butchers his own people to secure his own power.... The world, and the Iraqi people, would be better off without him. But I also know that Saddam poses no imminent and direct threat to the United States, or to his neighbors...and that in concert with the international community he can be contained until, in the way of all petty dictators, he falls away into the dustbin of history. I know that even a successful war against Iraq will require a U.S. occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences. I know that an invasion of Iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the Middle East, and encourage the worst, rather than best, impulses of the Arab world, and strengthen the recruitment arm of al-Qaeda. I am not opposed to all wars. I'm opposed to dumb wars. So for those of us who seek a more just and secure world for our children, let us send a clear message to the president. You Want a Fight, President Bush? You want a fight, President Bush? Let's finish the fight with Bin Laden and al-Qaeda, through effective, coordinated intelligence, and a shutting down of the financial networks that support terrorism, and a homeland security program that involves more than color-coded warnings. You want a fight, President Bush? Let's fight to make sure that...we vigorously enforce a nonproliferation treaty, and that former enemies and current allies like Russia safeguard and ultimately eliminate their stores of nuclear material, and that nations like Pakistan and India never use the terrible weapons already in their possession, and that the arms merchants in our own country stop feeding the countless wars that rage across the globe. You want a fight, President Bush? Let's fight to make sure our so-called allies in the Middle East, the Saudis and the Egyptians, stop oppressing their own people, and suppressing dissent, and tolerating corruption and inequality, and mismanaging their economies so that their youth grow up without education, without prospects, without hope, the ready recruits of terrorist cells. You want a fight, President Bush? Let's fight to wean ourselves off Middle East oil through an energy policy that doesn't simply serve the interests of Exxon and Mobil. Those are the battles that we need to fight. Those are the battles that we willingly join. The battles against ignorance and intolerance. Corruption and greed. Poverty and despair."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1346454715255</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 19:11:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346454898774-38</Id><Topic><Title>President Romney!!!

Indeed it did -- but not in the way the actor-turned-politician intended. Many pundits and observers have said that Eastwood's antics seemed out of place and difficult to understand. They are missing the obvious. Eastwood's bizarre presentation fit right in with the rest of the convention, since the only Obama that the Republicans are running against is an imaginary one. In fact, it was the perfect visual summary of the spirit of the entire 2012 Republican campaign, the candidates and their supporters -- an old white man who spent much of his life pretending to be a cowboy, talking smack to an imaginary president occupying the chair of his feverish imagination. There are several aspects to the pitch-perfect symbolism of Clint Eastwood's rambling dialogue with a nonexistent president he imagines to occupy the White House: 1. An elderly white man lecturing someone who cannot respond because he literally is not there. This represents the way so many of today's Republicans do not even want to engage the real Barack Obama in dialogue about real issues because they do not respect him enough to give his words, ideas, and actions a chance to penetrate into their minds for objective consideration. To many on the right, Obama is only somebody to be denegrated, and who doesn't deserve the opportunity to respond to their attacks; hence they express such outrage when his campaign releases its own ads defending his record and criticizing the policies of Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Men like Clint Eastwood, and the millions of other Republicans who envision themselves as noble cowboys of a bygone era, are loath to see Barack Obama sitting in the real chair of the Oval Office because in their eyes, a man like him -- young, black, from humble origins -- doesn't belong there. He only belongs in an empty chair, invisible, unable to speak. His place is to "serve his betters" and be silent, not to lead this country. 2. An elderly white man putting "ghetto words" in Obama's mouth, even though our president is a dignified speaker. It is not insignificant that Clint Eastwood pretended that the imaginary Barack Obama he was talking to responded to him with vulgarity. On multiple occasions, he pretended that Obama cursed him with the f-word as a response to his political criticisms. The real President Obama would not do this, of course, because he is a gentleman who speaks in a dignified manner. Republicans like Clint Eastwood cannot stand that. The Obama of their imagination is ghetto trash, the kind of person who would cuss and make his points using vulgarity rather than well-reasoned arguments. They literally imagine him as their image of the stereotypical young urban thug, because the reality of a young black liberal gentleman is too difficult for them to comprehend or accept. 3. An elderly white man talking about an Obama who doesn't even exist, by lying about everything he is, stands for, and has done. The Romney-Ryan campaign and the Republican Party in general have become defined by a series of lies about Barack Obama. Among them are: The lie that Barack Obama is not an American but a foreigner. The lie that Barack Obama is a socialist, communist or Marxist, who hates business and business owners and is stoking the flames of jealousy against "the successful," i.e. the rich. The lie that Barack Obama has raised taxes, even though he actually cut them. The lie that Barack Obama has cut Medicare. The lie that Barack Obama has removed the work requirement from welfare. The lie that Barack Obama has gone on a wild spree of irresponsible government spending which was responsible for the downgrading of the U.S. credit rating, even though the real cause was the Republicans playing chicken on a routine increase of the debt ceiling. The lie that Barack Obama has made the economy worse, even though economic growth has been increasing and unemployment has been decreasing since the Bush-caused economic crisis and recession of 2008-09. Quite literally, the president the Republicans are running against doesn't exist. They are running against an empty chair, and that chair is filled with everything they fear, hate, and disdain, which has emerged from their own obsolete imaginations. They are running against an imaginary president who simultaneously worships Allah and does a terrorist fist-bump with his wife, attends a too-liberal Christian church, is an atheist, wants to turn all of America gay, studies the works of Karl Marx from his pompous ivory tower and plots to make America a socialist paradise, an America he was never even born in and hates with a passion even though he wanted to be its president. Like Clint Eastwood and the cowboy movies of old, they live in a mythological America where white guys with firearms were the heroes, and everyone else knew their place. The women retired to their fainting couches, the blacks tilled the fields or served cold beverages to the big men with cigars, the lands of the west were kept clear of "injuns" and Mexicans through the barrel of a Caucasian man's gun, and everything was right in the world. That is the America that today's Republicans are yearning for. And they wish -- they wish so badly -- that the real Barack Obama and everyone who knows him for the dignified, decent president he really is, would, in the projected words of Clint Eastwood, "shut up," dismissing us to the status of a mere empty chair that powerlessly curses their rightful reign.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1346457310256</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 19:55:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346458400681-43</Id><Title>Found this at Google</Title><Msg>POLITICS Poll: Obama Dominating Romney On Key Issues According to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is in a tenuous position as he enters the general election.
