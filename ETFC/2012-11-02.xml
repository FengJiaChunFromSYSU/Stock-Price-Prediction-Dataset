We Need Food, We Need Clothing’: Staten Island Residents Plead for Help 3 Days After Sandy The residents of Staten Island are pleading for help from elected officials, begging for gasoline, food and clothing three days after Sandy slammed the New York City borough. “We’re going to die! We’re going to freeze! We got 90-year-old people!” Donna Solli told visiting officials. “You don’t understand. You gotta get your trucks down here on the corner now. It’s been three days!” Staten Island was one of the hardest-hit communities in New York City. More than 80,000 residents are still without power. Many are homeless, and at least 19 people died on Staten Island because of the storm. One of the devastated neighborhoods was overwhelmed by a violent surge of water. Residents described a super-sized wave as high as 20 feet, with water rushing into the streets like rapids. Staten Island resident Mike Abuzzio’s home is completely gone, with only his floor boards remaining. He, his wife and their two young daughters have been staying with relatives. “My youngest daughter yesterday said, ‘Daddy, I want to go,’” Abuzzio told ABC News. “I told her, ‘It’s going to be awhile, hon.’ She doesn’t understand. She’s 6.”</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1351888007692</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:26:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351889479224-28</Id><Topic><Title>Obama my brother, where out thou</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1351888007692</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:26:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo pinned to a wall in a bath House with that mental/physical midget Bloomberg slapping him.

The 57-year-old is mentally disabled, and Green said she doesn't understand the concept of casting a ballot. But this week, she called her parents to say she had voted for President Obama. The care home in Fayetteville where she lives registered its residents to vote and drove them to the polls, Green said. "My concern is that somebody told her who to vote for," he said. "She didn't even know there's two different parties." Complaints of uncomprehending voters being ferried to cast ballots surface every election. And in a presidential race as close as this year's, with huge levels of early voting, any perceived irregularity is falling under intense scrutiny. But federal and state laws are very clear - there is no competency test for voting. "The law specifically says that anyone with a disability is allowed to have assistance from anyone that they choose," said Terri Robertson, director of the Cumberland County Board of Elections. "As long as they can communicate to us in some way that they need assistance and who they wish to have assistance from, the law allows it."</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1351900327704</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:52:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351900559779-37</Id><Topic><Title>The real reason so many vote for Obama</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1351900327704</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:52:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>on the bright side - maybe "Slingblade" mistakenly voted for Romeny</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1351900559779</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 19:55:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351901195326-38</Id><Title>Democrats Dominate "Gump" Demographic</Title><Msg>exit poll's confirm</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1351901195326</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 20:06:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351901570233-39</Id><Title>The Chinese are Making Jeeps for the Italians</Title><Msg>How does the USA win in this equation?</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1351901570233</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 20:12:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351901712836-40</Id><Title>***FLASH*** The half pint money changer cancells marthon</Title><Msg>Looks like the little weasel caved afraid that the folks would march on the upper west side of N.Y City and have their way with the "millionaires and billionaires"..BTW, where is his pal the community agitator in all this mess...out on the trail talking about getting "revenge"... not on the foks who killed the Americans in Bengazi, but Rebulicans...what a class act! NYC Marathon Canceled The New York City Marathon was canceled Friday by Mayor Michael Bloomberg after mounting criticism that this was not the time for a race while the region is still recovering from Superstorm Sandy. With people in storm-ravaged areas still shivering without electricity and the death toll in New York City at more than 40, many New Yorkers recoiled at the prospect of police officers being assigned to protect a marathon on Sunday. An estimated 40,000 runners from around the world had been expected to take part in the 26.2-mile event.
