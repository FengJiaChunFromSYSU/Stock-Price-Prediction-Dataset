Time for dipshidiot to turn over his returns.</Title><Msg>ROMNEY’S FORMER COMPANY UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR TAX EVASION | Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by presidential candidate Mitt Romney, is under investigation for questionable tax practices, according to the New York Times. Since July, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been issuing subpoenas to private equity firms including Bain, which he believes intentionally changed management fees into capital gains as a way of hanging onto millions of dollars that would have otherwise been taxed at a higher rate. Bain alone is estimated to have saved “more than $200 million in federal income taxes and more than $20 million in Medicare taxes.” It is unclear whether the tax strategy was used while Romney was at the helm of the company, but the Times reports that Romney is still making money on funds that are using the method in question. A lawyer who handles Romney’s money says he “can confirm that neither he nor the trust has ever done this, whether before or after he retired from Bain Capital.” Still, little is known about Romney’s finances, except that he makes a windfall on capital gains each year, since he has refused to release his tax returns.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1346560222021</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 00:30:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346560945343-2</Id><Topic><Title>An opinion from the military</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1346526879189</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-01 15:14:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>returnusignoramus, You are the idiot in this board.

(w/Video) by hungrycoyote Wow! No video available yet because it just happened, but on The Ed Schultz Show just now, Ed interviewed two men who were among those who lost their jobs at the GM Auto Plant in Janesville, Wisconsin. One of them flat out said that he was in the room when President Obama, then candidate Obama, visited the plant and he never promised them that he would keep their plant open. The two men interviewed sat in front of a room full of people at the UAW Local 95 Hall. Q: Was Paul Ryan lying when he blamed President Obama for your plant's closure? Brad Dutcher: Absolutely. Absolutely, President Obama, then Senator Obama, had nothing to do with the decision to close our factory. That was an outright lie. Q: Did Paul Ryan fail to help you at all, Ron. What about that? Ron McInroy: Let me correct you first, Ed. I really didn't work at the plant but I am the Director of the Region in which the plant is located. So I just want to correct that little. Where we believe Paul Ryan lied and where he failed at is his inconsistencies. Early on if you look, he voted for stimulus package in the early 2000s, and at that time that was under George Bush, which again was a party line vote. If you look again 2008 just like you said earlier, it's really about the timeline and how things happened. When this plant closed in 2008, George Bush was still in office and their party line politics were in effect at that time. When Barack Obama was elected, and in 2009 the plant had already closed. But what's really important here is, once the plant had closed, where we needed Mr. Ryan to step up was simply when people needed TA grants to retool, reeducate themselves to get back into other jobs; he failed to do that. He did not want to reach out and do those grants. As far as where he's inconsistent on the unemployment, again, early on in the 2000 he was all for extended unemployment, but in 2009 when these workers here really needed that, when their plant was closed, he again failed to do that. Q: All right, Brad, I want to ask you. Are you under the impression, and do you think President Obama left the impression, that if he were elected president that that Janesville plant was going to remain open? Brad: Absolutely not. I was in that meeting when President Obama spoke inside our plant. There was never a promise made by then Senator Obama to keep our plant open. Absolutely not. That is completely false. And you know again ... [Cross-talk] Brad: Where Congressman Ryan failed us, is when these employees needed it most, and to pull a stunt that he did at the Republican National Convention, and use the closing of this plant and to disgrace the plight of these workers when even today four years after the closing of this plant we have families separated. We have moms and dads that drive four or five states away to come home on the weekends to see their families. [Cheering from people in room.] And to use that and to turn this plant closing and into a political football is shameful and he ought to be ashamed of himself and we ought to be ashamed of him. [Cheering from people in room.] This is just a quick transcript which is more difficult off the DVR than using the online video. Once the video is available at MSNBC, I'll add it to the diary. This is an interesting turn of events coupled with something I read yesterday, that I didn't really see anybody talking about here, at Talking Points Memo: Steve Rattner, who oversaw the Obama administration’s auto rescue, told TPM Thursday that Paul Ryan personally lobbied him in 2009 to intervene to reopen the Janesville, Wis., plant he cited in his convention speech on Wednesday. Rattner recalled telling him the same thing he had told other lawmakers with similar requests: The White House left those decisions to the car companies. “We did not get involved with individual plant decisions in the auto task force,” Rattner said in an interview with TPM. “So I find it ironic that Paul Ryan, who thinks the government should stay out of all this, was nonetheless lobbying to change that decision.” Auto Czar To Paul Ryan: Government Doesn’t Decide Which Plants Stay Open This was also being reported at Bloomberg News Businessweek: “The Obama administration had nothing to do with any individual plant-closing decisions,” Steven Rattner, who headed Obama’s auto task force, said yesterday in an interview. “But in this case, it’s particularly egregious to suggest that the administration had any connection since this decision was made and announced before Barack Obama became president.” GM Halted SUV-Making in Ryan’s Hometown Before Obama Took Office So wow! Paul Ryan has some explaining to do. These workers in Janesville don't back up his story. The government didn't tell the auto industry what to do. The decisions were left to the business. Oh, and let's not forget the paper trail.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1346561212654</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 00:46:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346569012437-4</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan a pathological liar ?

Ryan reportedly recalled this event incorrectly just days ago, during an August 16 speech in Ohio. Ryan reportedly alleged that Obama said he'd "keep that plant open," and therefore broke his promise because the plant closed. "That plant was shut down in 2009. I remember President Obama visiting it when he was first running, saying he'll keep that plant open," Ryan said, according to the Janesville Gazette. "One more broken promise." The Detroit News pointed out that Obama made no such promise in the February 13, 2008, speech, and indeed, we've seen no account suggesting that Obama did. Here is the quote at issue, according to an account kept by the Council on Foreign Relations: "I know that General Motors received some bad news yesterday, and I know how hard your governor has fought to keep jobs in this plant. But I also know how much progress you've made -- how many hybrids and fuel-efficient vehicles you're churning out," Obama said. "And I believe that if our government is there to support you, and give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition, that this plant will be here for another hundred years." By "bad news," Obama apparently was referring to GM's February 12, 2008, announcement that it had a $38.7 billion adjusted net loss for 2007. So, back on August 16 of this year, it does appear Ryan was wrong for saying Obama promised to keep it open. The News and the Gazette went further, reporting that the plant halted production in December 2008, and saying that Ryan essentially was criticizing Obama for failing to save a plant that closed before Obama took office. However, while December 2008 saw the end of the vast majority of the plant's work, the Gazette itself has reported that the plant didn't close fully until April 2009. ....................... Now, compare Ryan's Wednesday night statement with the one he gave on August 16. On Wednesday, Ryan said nothing of Obama making a promise, but rather quoted him. The quote is truncated (in Ryan's prepared remarks released to the media, an ellipsis replaces the missing words, "give you the assistance you need to re-tool and make this transition") but essentially is correct. The only thing Ryan appears to have gotten technically wrong in Wednesday's version was saying that the plant didn't last another year. It did last another year -- more like 14 months -- if the Isuzu line and its 57 workers count. So, though Ryan might have been incorrect in the August 16 telling, he cleaned it up for Wednesday's convention. Obama said what Ryan said he said. But to fairly evaluate Obama's statement, at least two pieces of context -- missing from Ryan's account -- would be useful: First, that Obama wasn't telling this plant that he'd save it from a pending closure. He wasn't addressing a plant that he knew to be closing, because the closure announcement didn't come until four months after his speech. Second, although the plant's last bit of production stopped early in Obama's presidency and the plant remains closed, the closure was planned before Obama became president.

Some years ago, our government made an effort to clean up sweatshops on the islands — including Saipan — that have been under the control of the United States since the end of World War II. Chinese women were brought over to the islands to work under awful conditions — subject to forced abortions and prostitution and paid pennies for producing garments labeled “Made in the USA.” Corrupt local officials hired the firm of infamous lobbyist Jack Abramoff — for more than four million dollars — to try to stop the reforms proposed back in Washington. Abramoff, in turn, hired Ralph Reed and his political direct mail company, Millennium Marketing, to conduct a phony grass roots campaign urging Alabama Christians to write their local congressman to oppose the reforms. Of course, Reed didn’t tell those Christians he was being paid to help keep running sweatshops that exploited women. Instead, he told them the reforms were a trick orchestrated by the left and organized labor. Limits on Chinese workers would keep them from being “exposed to the teachings of Jesus Christ.” His company explained it was just trying to encourage “grass roots citizens to promote the propagation of the Gospel” Ralph Reed in the Marianas Trenches by Bill Moyers and Michael Winship</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1346591512500</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 09:11:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346593361347-9</Id><Title>Ryan's labor day words</Title><Msg>Paul Ryan's Labor Day Promise to American Workers: Candy, a Sports Schedule, and Nothing Else by John Nichols ......With his speech to the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Paul Ryan attempted to reposition himself as someone other than the millionaire son of privilege and career politician that he is..... ..........Janesville used to be a major manufacturing center. Now it has fallen on hard times. Like so many manufacturing communities in the Great Lakes region, it has been rocked by the outsourcing of U.S. jobs. That's not Ryan's concern, however.

As he marched with other politicians in the Janesville Labor Day parade, the congressman was confronted by Wisconsin workers who were struggling with high unemployment and bleak prospects. A man was videotaped asking what his representative planned to do to aid Ryan's unemployed constituents. "So what should I have to work for to get a job?" the man asked. "Should I have to work the same wages as in China? Should I have to work for $1 an hour?" Ryan tried to brush his questioner off. But when the man persisted, saying, "C'mon, we're all here to have a good time." When he was reminded that it was Labor Day, which would seem to be an appropriate time to discuss unemployment and the condition of workers, Ryan finally offered something: "Would you like some candy?" Ryan asked. "Would you like a Packer-Badger schedule?" Candy or a sports schedule. That's all job-seeking Wisconsinites ever got from Paul Ryan. And that's all job-seeking Americans will ever get from him.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1346593361347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 09:42:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346597056128-10</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan a pathological liar ?

Yes, that Fox News: [T]o anyone paying the slightest bit of attention to facts, Ryan’s speech was an apparent attempt to set the world record for the greatest number of blatant lies and misrepresentations slipped into a single political speech. On this measure, while it was Romney who ran the Olympics, Ryan earned the gold. Apparently Fox News has started paying attention to facts and goes on to name some that Ryan blurred the edges of during his speech — with supporting links and everything: Fact: While Ryan tried to pin the downgrade of the United States’ credit rating on spending under President Obama, the credit rating was actually downgraded because Republicans threatened not to raise the debt ceiling. Fact: While Ryan blamed President Obama for the shut down of a GM plant in Janesville, Wisconsin, the plant was actually closed under President George W. Bush. Ryan actually asked for federal spending to save the plant, while Romney has criticized the auto industry bailout that President Obama ultimately enacted to prevent other plants from closing. Fact: Though Ryan insisted that President Obama wants to give all the credit for private sector success to government, that isn’t what the president said. Period. Fact: Though Paul Ryan accused President Obama of taking $716 billion out of Medicare, the fact is that that amount was savings in Medicare reimbursement rates (which, incidentally, save Medicare recipients out-of-pocket costs, too) and Ryan himself embraced these savings in his budget plan. To Fox News‘ (dis)credit, they also called Ryan’s speech “dazzling,” patting the prospective VP on the back for helping to humanize the Automatic Teller Machine with whom he shares a ticket. Then Fox News zagged instead of zigging once again, calling the speech “distracting” by failing to mention a few things that may not sit so well with voters — again, with supporting links!: Ryan didn’t mention his extremist stance on banning all abortions with no exception for rape or incest, a stance that is out of touch with 75% of American voters. Ryan didn’t mention his previous plan to hand over Social Security to Wall Street. Ryan didn’t mention his numerous votes to raise spending and balloon the deficit when George W. Bush was president. Ryan didn’t mention how his budget would eviscerate programs that help the poor and raise taxes on 95% of Americans in order to cut taxes for millionaires and billionaires even further and increase — yes, increase —the deficit. We don’t know if the Fox News site has been a victim of cyberterrorism, or someone had an extra bowl of bipartisan Wheaties this morning, but blatantly calling #$%$ on a Republican candidate when that number is almost strictly reserved for the opposition is…weird. Fair and balanced.

WASHINGTON -- Tax experts who have begun to examine the Bain Capital documents released Thursday by Gawker are raising questions as to whether presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has paid all the taxes he owed. At issue are two tax-avoidance techniques employed by Bain Capital, the firm founded by Romney, which have been commonly used in the private equity world but have come under increasing legal scrutiny. The first scheme involves owning U.S. dividend-paying stocks in an offshore account and pretending, for accounting purposes, not to own the stock. Instead, the taxpayer tells the Internal Revenue Service that he owns a derivative product that is identical in every way to the stock -- except it isn't the stock, so therefore no U.S. taxes are owed. It's called a "total return equity swap," because the buyer still gets the benefit -- the "total return" -- of owning the stock, or equity. "This use of total return equity swaps, such as to avoid the U.S. dividend withholding tax, was very widespread for more than a decade, and may not be dead yet, although the IRS issued a shot-across-the-bow Notice concerning the practice in 2010," writes Daniel Shaviro, the Wayne Perry Professor of Taxation at New York University School of Law. "But taxpayers who engaged in it to avoid the dividend withholding tax were coming perilously close to committing tax fraud, in cases where the economic equivalence to direct ownership was too great." The second technique is "not legal," according to Victor Fleischer, a tax expert and professor of law at the University of Colorado. A taxpayer saves substantial amounts of money by pretending that regular income received as a management fee for running a private equity firm is not income, but is instead a capital gain. That drops the tax rate on that income from 35 percent to 15 percent. Citing the Gawker documents, Fleischer notes that Bain engaged in the management-fee maneuver to reduce the tax bill of its investors. "Unlike carried interest, which is unseemly but perfectly legal, Bain’s management fee conversions are not legal. If challenged in court, Bain would lose. The Bain partners, in my opinion, misreported their income if they reported these converted fees as capital gain instead of ordinary income," he writes. Shaviro, meanwhile, notes that Bain employed a version of the total return equity swap and says that taxpayers who engage in the practice have little legal justification for doing so. "[T]he only leg that taxpayers had to stand on in some of these cases was common practice and the apparent lack of IRS enforcement (not a very strong leg if the correct application of the law was clear)," he writes. "How far out on the limb were Bain-affiliated foreign entities that were making money through total return equity swaps, and claiming not to owe U.S. withholding tax? And what should we make of this, for purposes of the presidential campaign, if what they were doing, while legally dubious, was common practice?" "The unauthorized disclosure of a number of confidential fund financial statements is unfortunate," said Charlyn Lusk, a spokeswoman for Bain Capital. "Our fund financials are routinely prepared by auditors and demonstrate a commitment to transparency with our investors and regulators, and compliance with all laws." Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said that Romney is not responsible for whatever tax strategy employed. "As we have said many times before, Governor and Mrs. Romney's assets are managed on a blind basis. They do not control the investment of these assets, the investment decisions are made by a trustee," he said. But if Bain used improper tax-avoidance techniques, the Romneys would be required to amend their returns regardless of the blind nature of the investments. Private equity managers already get the vast majority of their income from capital gains, which are taxed a lower rate, but also take a fee -- typically 2 percent -- off the top. That management fee is income. But some private equity managers have claimed to "waive" that fee in exchange for future capital gains. "In exchange for a minimal amount of economic risk, the tax benefit is enormous: the compensation is transformed from ordinary income (taxed at 35%) into capital gain (taxed at 15%). Because the management fees for a large private equity fund can be ten or twenty million per year, the tax dodge can literally save millions in taxes every year," writes Fleischer. "The problem is that it is not legal." The IRS says the fee cannot be waived in exchange for capital gains if the income "relates to a substantially certain and predictable stream of income from partnership assets." In other words, Bain investors would need to convince a judge that their revenue stream was risky and not "substantially certain and predictable." Fleischer says he doesn't think the tactic would hold up in court. "Because the deals vary in their aggressiveness, there is some disagreement among practitioners about when it works and when it doesn’t," he writes. "But in my opinion, and the opinion of many tax practitioners, the practices that were common in the private equity industry in the 2000s became very, very questionable, and it’s unlikely that they would have stood up in court." But did Romney himself benefit from these maneuvers? And is Romney responsible for the legally dubious tax avoidance strategies Bain employed? Yes, Fleischer concludes: Yes, Romney left Bain in 1999 or 2002. But as part of his severance agreement, he continues to receive interests in these funds, which he has reported on his financial disclosures. In the usual case, a departing partner would receive an economic stake in the GP (Bain Capital Partners X, LP), rather than an economic stake in the LP (Bain Capital Fund X, LP) — representing a payment for the management services he provided in the past. Indeed, because he filed an 83(b) election, we can be sure that he received GP interests as part of his severance agreement, and that he therefore benefited personally from management fee conversions. [...] Romney here is not like a passive mutual fund investor. He helped engineer the funds in the first place. For at least some of the funds, the fee conversion was set in place at the time of the fund’s formation — in the case of Fund VII, when Romney was the sole shareholder of the management company that actually waived the fees (2000). It seems reasonable to infer that fee conversions were in place for earlier vintages of Bain Capital funds as well. I haven’t yet reviewed all of the Gawker documents, but we are talking hundreds of millions of dollars in tax liability on these funds — one hundred million in Fund IX alone (20% of the $500 million converted), another $70 million in fund X. It is unthinkable that in the 1990s through 2002, when Romney was putting together funds, that he was unaware of the fee conversion strategy, or that he was unaware that he continued to benefit from it today. "The Bain documents posted yesterday show that Bain Capital will go to great lengths to help its partners and its investors avoid tax," said Rebecca Wilkins, senior counsel at Citizens for Tax Justice. "Beyond simply putting their funds offshore, the Bain private equity funds are using aggressive tax-planning techniques such as blocker corporations, equity swaps, alternative investment vehicles, and management fee conversions." Rep. Sandy Levin of Michigan, the top Democrat on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, questioned the fee conversion strategy in a statement. “[R]eports today indicating that Bain managers converted even their regular management fees into additional carried interest income that is taxed at capital gains rates is a particularly egregious example of how wealthy fund managers are able to avoid paying the same tax rates on their compensation as other Americans," he said. "This is a stark reminder of why Congress needs to act to close this loophole."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1346604237732</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 12:43:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346607973704-15</Id><Topic><Title>Bain investigated for TAX EVASION.

Abramoff, in turn, hired Ralph Reed and his political direct mail company, Millennium Marketing, to conduct a phony grass roots campaign urging Alabama Christians to write their local congressman to oppose the reforms. Of course, Reed didn’t tell those Christians he was being paid to help keep running sweatshops that exploited women.

Here's the full transcript of that rule. And finally, New Rule: Republicans don't have to accept evolution, economics, climatology, or human sexuality, but I just watched a week of their national convention, and I need them to admit the historical existence of George W. Bush. (audience applause) If your party can run the nation for eight years, and then have a national convention and not invite Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Colin Powell, Karl Rove, or Tom DeLay... (audience applause) you're not a political movement, you're the witness protection program. In fact, Republicans, next time, instead of holding a convention without your most recent President, your most recent Vice-President, your most recent Vice-Presidential nominee, and most of the runners-up from your most recent primary, why not just wave one of those Men in Black memory eraser wands in our face, and make us forget everything we know about you? (audience applause) Now, I'm sure Sarah Palin would've been uncomfortable at the convention — much of it was held indoors — but isn't it traditional to invite the last nominee for VP? Even if conceiving her was a mistake, aren't you morally obliged to bring her to term? (wild audience applause) Cuz if you went by what they said this week, here's how the history of America went down. OK, first the Founding Fathers — you know, the original teabaggers — they got the Constitution directly from Jesus. Then the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, freed the slaves. And the Republican Party to this very day has never stopped fighting for the black man. Except that Romney and Ryan are now polling at zero. Zero percent among blacks. They couldn't get a black guy to vote for them if they gave him a Lincoln! (audience applause) And Mitt Romney may yet try that. And then came, of course, St. Reagan, who was the innovator of the Republican Party's greatest power, the ability to completely forget. So I'm just asking, how can we trust Republicans with the future, when as far as I can tell from Tampa, the world ended the year Reagan left office? Like in 1988, we all just fell into a deep sleep listening to "Pour Some Sugar on Me", and when we woke up on Monday morning, Obama and his black army had wrecked the joint. (wild audience applause) I mean, come on! George Bush was President just 3 ½ years ago! They talk about him like he's some vague pop culture reference from way back, like the Snapple lady, or that rap duo who wore their pants on backwards. He was President for two terms! It's like holding a Star Trek convention, and not inviting Shatner. Because, let's be real. If you're trying to sell what the Republican Party can do for you, it's best not to remind people of what its recent screw-ups actually did to you. (audience applause) Especially during hurricane season! The past accomplishments of the team that tanked the economy, legalized torture, and made the surplus disappear, is not the best advertisement for the future, for the same reason you never hear the words, "from the director of Corky Romano...."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1346620483452</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 17:14:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346621532756-20</Id><Title>Like Father like Sons</Title><Msg>"Presidential candidate Mitt Romney was asked to explain why none of his five sons are in the military and he said that his sons demonstrate their patriotism by going on the road and campaigning for him.

According to him - and contrary to the statement released by the Romney campaign, Bain has used this technique, and their use of it is illegal. Fund VII. Gawker today posted some Bain documents today showing that Bain, like many other PE firms, had engaged in this practice of converting management fees into capital gain. Unlike carried interest, which is unseemly but perfectly legal, Bain’s management fee conversions are not legal. If challenged in court, Bain would lose. The Bain partners, in my opinion, misreported their income if they reported these converted fees as capital gain instead of ordinary income."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1346631788324</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 20:23:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346632933601-35</Id><Title>Dipshidiot's war on women</Title><Msg>Sun Sep 02, 2012 at 05:00 PM PDT Romney's feint on reproductive rights by Laurence Lewis Mitt Romney flip flopping heads It's a shame Mitt Romney didn't stay longer in London to watch some of the diving and gymnastics competitions. Granted, the longer Romney remained, the greater would have been the risk that our special relationship would have degenerated into the atmosphere of 1812; and while watching the divers and gymnasts wouldn't have done a thing to help Romney to learn honesty or empathy or even just a basic touch of humanity, he at least might have gleaned how to infuse into his endless twists and turns and somersaults and other political and policy contortions a modicum of style. Rarely has a politician been so lousy at politics and policy while also looking so bad at playing at them. As with so many issues, on abortion and reproductive rights Romney has mastered the art of appearing to stand for anything or everything while actually standing for nothing; but even that is an illusion. It's one thing to stake two stands on an issue, but Romney has managed to do better than that: Mitt Romney, in fact, has taken multiple and internally conflicting positions on abortion rights within the past four years – both in this campaign cycle and the 2008 one. Indeed, as his nominating convention was waiting out a very symbolic and metaphorical storm last week, Romney and one of his campaign spokespeople managed to contradict themselves on Romney's abortion stance within but a few hours. And no one was surprised. Romney's seeming lack of core beliefs and his incapacity for taking a position on even the most defining issues of our time are not bugs in his presidential campaign, they are in fact features. Romney doesn't want anyone to know what he will do as president. Romney wants to test one of this nation's most famous political maxims, as he attempts to fool all of the people all of the time. Romney's wild ride on abortion rights last week began with him appearing to separate himself from the teabaggers and theocrats, not to mention his own running mate, seemingly returning to the more moderate stance many expected him to take once his nomination was locked down and he didn't need to pretend to be appeasing the frothing misogynistic Republican base. But the real clue to what he actually intends was revealed not in his words about policy but in his words about process: My position has been clear throughout this campaign. I'm in favor of abortion being legal in the case of rape and incest and the health and life of the mother. But recognize, this is the decision that will be made by the Supreme Court. The Democrats try and make this a political issue every four years, but this is a matter in the courts. It's been settled for some time in the courts. Of course, his position hasn't been clear, and as already noted it was but hours until his campaign was equivocating even on this, but his real point was about how he intends to destroy reproductive choice. His weaseling around on the issue was not what mattered, his strong statement about process was. But recognize, this is the decision that will be made by the Supreme Court. The Democrats try and make this a political issue every four years, but this is a matter in the courts. It's been settled for some time in the courts. In other words, Romney doesn't intend to legislate an end to reproductive choice, and he certainly doesn't intend some sort of executive maneuver. He intends for this decision to be made by the Supreme Court. The issue has been settled for some time in the courts, but we all know that the current extremist activist right-wing Supreme Court has no problem unsettling and overturning to the point of creating law that wasn't even being ajudicated. And that is how Mitt Romney intends to eviscerate reproductive rights: As a candidate, Romney has pledged to nominate judges in the mold of the Supreme Court's four most conservative justices, and he has said the court should overrule Roe v. Wade, the 1973 opinion that said women have a right to an abortion. Romney formed a committee of lawyers in August 2011 to advise him on court nominations and on legal policy questions led by prominent conservatives such as Robert Bork, whose conservative views led Democrats to block his 1987 nomination to the court. Romney claims to be qualified to be president because he was governor of Massachusetts, but doesn't accept responsibility for what he did as governor of Massachusetts. Romney claims to be qualified to be president because he was head of the Salt Lake City Olympics, but doesn't accept responsibility for what he did as head of the Salt Lake City Olympics. Romney claims to be qualified to be president because he was a business executive, but doesn't accept responsibility for what he did as a business executive. And so he now claims whatever he cares to claim on any given day or any given hour on one of the most contentious issues of our time, but he actually intends to take no responsibility whatsoever for what happens on that issue. Romney has spent his entire life avoiding responsibility, whether it was protesting in favor of a war he knew he himself would not have to go fight, or issuing a soulless, gutless non-apology for having committed a hate crime while a teenager. On abortion and reproductive rights Romney again intends to do the wrong thing without being held accountable. If he becomes president, Mitt Romney will not himself take direct action to end abortion and reproductive rights. But he will appoint Supreme Court justices who will.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1346632933601</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 20:42:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346633720971-36</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan a pathological liar ?

Even a key Democratic strategist, Bill Burton, a former press secretary for President Obama, tweeted shortly after the speech ended: "Romney actually avoided almost all of the lies from Ryan's speech." While he may have avoided the same lies as Ryan, Romney's speech had its own fair share of falsehoods too. And lest it seem like the fact-checking was simply a partisan matter, Sally Kohn of Fox News wrote that "to anyone paying the slightest bit of attention to facts, Ryan's speech was an apparent attempt to set the world record for the greatest number of blatant lies and misrepresentations slipped into a single political speech."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1346634535467</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 21:08:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346636988807-38</Id><Title>Who Is The Smallest Government Spender Since Eisenhower? Would You Believe It's Barack Obama?</Title><Msg>from Forbes It’s enough to make even the most ardent Obama cynic scratch his head in confusion. Amidst all the cries of Barack Obama being the most prolific big government spender the nation has ever suffered, Marketwatch is reporting that our president has actually been tighter with a buck than any United States president since Dwight D. Eisenhower. Who knew? Check out the chart – So, how have the Republicans managed to persuade Americans to buy into the whole “Obama as big spender” narrative? It might have something to do with the first year of the Obama presidency where the federal budget increased a whopping 17.9% —going from $2.98 trillion to $3.52 trillion. I’ll bet you think that this is the result of the Obama sponsored stimulus plan that is so frequently vilified by the conservatives…but you would be wrong. The first year of any incoming president term is saddled—for better or for worse—with the budget set by the president whom immediately precedes the new occupant of the White House. Indeed, not only was the 2009 budget the property of George W. Bush—and passed by the 2008 Congress—it was in effect four months before Barack Obama took the oath of office. Accordingly, the first budget that can be blamed on our current president began in 2010 with the budgets running through and including including fiscal year 2013 standing as charges on the Obama account, even if a President Willard M. Romney takes over the office on January 20, 2013. So, how do the actual Obama annual budgets look? Courtesy of Marketwatch In fiscal 2010 (the first Obama budget) spending fell 1.8% to $3.46 trillion. In fiscal 2011, spending rose 4.3% to $3.60 trillion. In fiscal 2012, spending is set to rise 0.7% to $3.63 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the budget that was agreed to last August. Finally in fiscal 2013 — the final budget of Obama’s term — spending is scheduled to fall 1.3% to $3.58 trillion. Read the CBO’s latest budget outlook. No doubt, many will wish to give the credit to the efforts of the GOP controlled House of Representatives. That’s fine if that’s what works for you. However, you don’t get to have it both ways. Credit whom you will, but if you are truly interested in a fair analysis of the Obama years to date—at least when it comes to spending—you’re going to have to acknowledge that under the Obama watch, even President Reagan would have to give our current president a thumbs up when it comes to his record for stretching a dollar. Of course, the Heritage Foundation is having none of it, attempting to counter the actual numbers by pretending that the spending initiated by the Bush Administration is the fault of Obama. As I understand the argument Heritage is putting forth —and I have provided the link to the Heritage rebuttal so you can decide for yourself—Marketwatch, in using the baseline that Obama inherited, is making it too easy on the President. But then, with the Heritage Foundation being the creator of the individual mandate concept in healthcare only to rebut the same when it was no longer politically convenient, I’m not quite sure why anyone believes much of anything they have to say any longer. With their history of reversing course for convenience, I can’t help but wonder, should they find themselves reviewing the spending record of a President Romney four years from today, whether they might be tempted to use the Obama numbers as the baseline for such a new Administration.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1346636988807</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 21:49:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346640975128-39</Id><Title>Dumb as rocks crowd still searching for new MB- LMAO!!!</Title><Msg>Re: Really now......

"Saving" GM with people's money is not an act of heroism. GM still owns us $25B. And 4 years after collapse still in serious trouble. Obama was cheering his crowd in Janesville, WI in 2008, and let their plant to go down. That's the point Ryan was making. Shouldn't this plant be saved ("re-tooled") first? See, in 2008 Obama was talking about some composite plant, like composite girlfriend from his book. He lives with dreams from his socialist father. It is a dream, not your stupid day to day life! He doesn't make promises to keep, he makes them to get elected. There would be GM today without government help. Stronger and healthier GM.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1346642714850</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 23:25:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
