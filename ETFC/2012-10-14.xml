Further, the same House Republicans who are criticizing diplomatic security in Libya, including Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, have aggressively slashed the budget – cutting the administration's request for embassy security by $128 million in 2011 and $331 million in 2012. House Republicans propose to cut the administration's request for 2013 by $216 million. We cannot assure our diplomats perfect security.

Rohatyn, Shultz, Cheney `Privatization' Scheme To Wreck U.S. National Security by Jeffrey Steinberg On Oct. 9, 2004, two leading American figures in the International Synarchy, George Shultz and Felix Rohatyn, teamed up in an assault upon the national sovereignty and national security of the United States. Under the auspices of George P. Shultz's Princeton Project on National Security, the Rohatyn Center for International Affairs at Middlebury College, and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, jointly sponsored a conference promoting "The Privatization of National Security," at the Middlebury College campus in Vermont. The conference brought together a dozen or so academics, former government officials, and retired military officers to chart out the vast expansion of the privatization of military functions, through PMCs—private military companies. According to the Rohatyn Center's annual report of 2004-05, Shultz is the co-chairman of the Princeton Project, which is funded by the Ford Foundation, and "aims to move beyond the ... standard ways of thinking about national security." Translated into plain English, Shultz and Rohatyn are leading the drive to eliminate the sovereign nation-state, by outsourcing to private multinational corporations, virtually all national security and military functions, including all non-combat and some core combat functions of the military itself.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1350221544647</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 09:32:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350221656235-5</Id><Topic><Title>dear repelicans please explian mitt's miracle cure for medicare</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1350137703335</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 10:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>explain how mitten's miraculous fix of medicare gets paid for: All 55 and older get the full, as is , no changes to, medicare....... and all under age 55 get the same , if they "choose" it over a mitten's voucher.............. so , medicare went from being near broke, to totally fixed , good to go AS IS for EVERYONE.. even those younger than 55 can choose traditional as is medicare as per mitt's promise at the debate......................wow!.......... do the tax cuts pay for it?

We believe that President Barack Obama’s progress on these issues merits him a second term in the White House. Four years ago on this page, we endorsed Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona over Obama. We wrote that we were impressed with Obama, but McCain would “bring the Iraq war to a successful conclusion, work to end American dependence on foreign oil, reduce America's output of climate-changing gases and begin the rebuilding of our economy.” The Democratic president has done all those things and more. He is calm under pressure and courageous in standing up for the rights of all Americans, including the poor, veterans, the elderly, women, gays and immigrants. In contrast, we’ve sometimes found it hard in the last few weeks to tell just what Obama’s challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, really stands for."</Msg><Username>fritzinacrotchlesstutu</Username><Timestamp>1350228435165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 11:27:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350228482480-17</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC Accelerated Rate of Movement...

The 2009 Recovery Act is derided by Republicans for its $787 billion price tag, but they don't want voters to remember the context. It's not wrong to point out the program's cost in a country with huge debts. But with the nation desperate for employment, economists say the stimulus created 2.5 million jobs and added up to 3.8 percent to the gross national product. The recovery is slow, but its speed has been hampered by obstinate Republicans in Congress dead set on opposing any program that might boost Obama's reelection. They say they can't be blamed for Obama's lack of success earlier in his administration, when Democrats held the House and Senate. But Americans need to remember that Congress' rules give great power to the minority party to thwart legislation. That doesn't mean Obama shouldn't be criticized for not doing a better job with the economy. But Romney hasn't presented any evidence that he would have done better. He has reached back to the Republicans' familiar trickle-down rhetoric about creating jobs by cutting taxes. But he leaves out key details, so no one can tell if his plan would work."</Msg><Username>fritzinacrotchlesstutu</Username><Timestamp>1350228598014</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 11:29:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350230999524-20</Id><Title>Ryan admitted there is no real tax plan, it will be worked out in the future</Title><Msg>"I've never thought much of Joe Biden. But man, did he get it right in last night's debate, and not just because he walloped sniveling little Paul Ryan on the facts The essence of the whole campaign for me was crystalized in the debate exchange over Romney's 20 percent tax-cut plan. ABC's Martha Raddatz turned the questioning to Ryan: MS. RADDATZ: Well, let's talk about this 20 percent. VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN: Well – (chuckles) – MS. RADDATZ: You have refused yet again to offer specifics on how you pay for that 20 percent across-the-board tax cut. Do you actually have the specifics, or are you still working on it, and that's why you won't tell voters? Here Ryan is presented with a simple yes-or-no answer. Since he doesn't have the answer, he immediately starts slithering and equivocating: REP. RYAN: Different than this administration, we actually want to have big bipartisan agreements. You see, I understand the – "We want to have bipartisan agreements?" This coming from a Republican congressman? These guys would stall a bill to name a post office after Shirley Temple. Biden, absolutely properly, chuckled and said, "That'd be a first for a Republican congress." Then Raddatz did exactly what any self-respecting journalist should do in that situation: she objected to being lied to, and yanked on the leash, forcing Ryan back to the question. I'm convinced Raddatz wouldn't have pounced on Ryan if he hadn't trotted out this preposterous line about bipartisanism. Where does Ryan think we've all been living, Mars? It's one thing to pull that on some crowd of unsuspecting voters that hasn't followed politics that much and doesn't know the history. But any professional political journalist knows enough to know the abject comedy of that line. Still, Ryan was banking on the moderator not getting in the way and just letting him dump his trash on audiences. Instead, she aggressively grabbed Ryan by his puppy-scruff and pushed him back into the mess of his own proposal: MS. RADDATZ: Do you have the specifics? Do you have the math? Do you know exactly what you're doing? So now the ball is in Ryan's court. The answer he gives is astounding: REP. RYAN: Look – look at what Mitt – look at what Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill did. They worked together out of a framework to lower tax rates and broaden the base, and they worked together to fix that. What we're saying is here's our framework: Lower tax rates 20 percent – we raise about $1.2 trillion through income taxes. We forgo about 1.1 trillion [dollars] in loopholes and deductions. And so what we're saying is deny those loopholes and deductions to higher-income taxpayers so that more of their income is taxed, which has a broader base of taxation – Three things about this answer: 1) Ryan again here refuses to answer Raddatz's yes-or-no question about specifics. So now we know the answer: there are no specifics. 2) In lieu of those nonexistent specifics, what Ryan basically says is that he and Romney will set the framework – "Lower taxes by 20 percent" – and then they'll work out the specifics of how to get there with the Democrats in bipartisan fashion. 3) So essentially, Ryan has just admitted on national television that the Romney tax plan will be worked out after the election with the same Democrats from whom they are now, before the election, hiding any and all details................."

WASHINGTON -- For the first time publicly, the Mitt Romney campaign was asked Sunday to defend the six studies it routinely cites as supportive of the candidate's tax plan. The studies have been called into question for weeks now, as only one or two of them are actually academic. The rest are blog posts and op-eds, some written by the same author, others by conservative sources. One study cited was actually paid for by the campaign itself, though the campaign has since replaced that study with another. More problematic for Romney is that a number of them reached conclusions that he would find uncomfortable. Harvard economist Martin Feldstein, for instance, said that Romney's tax plan could work mathematically if it eliminated deductions and exemptions for individuals making over $100,000 per year. A Princeton study put that figure at $200,000, though the author told Bloomberg News that the figure may need to be brought down to pay for Romney's 20 percent across-the-board reduction in tax rates. Still, the Romney campaign continues to cite those studies, including during the presidential debates. On Sunday, Fox News' Chris Wallace asked top adviser Ed Gillespie whether that was misleading. Gillespie: These are very credible sources, and, you know... Wallace: One of them is from a guy who is – is a blog from a guy who was a top advisor to George W. Bush. So these are hardly nonpartisan studies. Gillespie: Look, Chris I think if you look at Harvard and AEI [American Enterprise Institute] and other studies are very credible sources for economic analysis Wallace: You wouldn't say that AEI is a conservative think tank? Gillespie: I would say it is a right-leaning think tank. That doesn't make it not credible. Wallace: It doesn't make it nonpartisan. Gillespie: It does make it nonpartisan. It's not a partisan organization, I can tell you, there are many instances where there have been things AEI came out with and said, I didn't find it to be necessarily to be helpful to the Republican Party. Wallace: Would you say Brookings Institution is nonpartisan? Gillespie: I would say the Brookings Institution is left leaning and nonpartisan.</Msg><Username>fritzinacrotchlesstutu</Username><Timestamp>1350250599278</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 17:36:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350250793401-48</Id><Topic><Title>Biden's Lying Smirky Malarky</Title><Username>fascist_left</Username><Timestamp>1350222286665</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 09:44:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Allah willing, American people wan't understand what it is we are trying to do until it is too late.

We believe that President Barack Obama’s progress on these issues merits him a second term in the White House. Four years ago on this page, we endorsed Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona over Obama. We wrote that we were impressed with Obama, but McCain would “bring the Iraq war to a successful conclusion, work to end American dependence on foreign oil, reduce America's output of climate-changing gases and begin the rebuilding of our economy.” The Democratic president has done all those things and more. He is calm under pressure and courageous in standing up for the rights of all Americans, including the poor, veterans, the elderly, women, gays and immigrants. In contrast, we’ve sometimes found it hard in the last few weeks to tell just what Obama’s challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, really stands for. Obama is not always as gregarious as many Americans might like him to be, but he is committed to his country and candid with it — to the point of releasing far more of his tax returns than Romney. While Obama commits the occasional gaffe, we can’t imagine him ever dismissing 47 percent of his fellow Americans — as Romney did, and later apologized for doing. After weeks of challenges, Romney’s campaign was on an upswing last week after a decisive victory in the first debate. But Obama has had a generally strong four years. He and Vice President Joe Biden form a seasoned, consistent ticket, one much more promising and reliable than that of Romney and his running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Under Obama’s policies, including the successful bailout of General Motors, the country averted what could have been a far worse economic disaster, maybe even a depression. The economy is slowly recovering — the national unemployment rate has finally fallen below 8 percent — and the president’s policies of continued government investment in infrastructure and education offer the best hope that the recovery will accelerate. Obama promises to cut spending and raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans, but keep taxes where they are for the vast majority. Romney’s policies — warmed-over trickle-down economics — will make matters worse. We say that with a caveat, however, because Romney’s plans are ever-changing and it is hard to know just where his policies would end and those of the much more conservative Ryan would begin. On national security, Obama has gotten American combat troops out of Iraq while winding down the American presence in Afghanistan. He has used American military might to fight international terrorism to a degree that no one anticipated in 2008. He showed strong leadership in ordering the successful raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The Obama foreign policy — as seen in Libya — requires our allies to handle a great share of our common defense burden, especially when the interests at stake are dearer to those allies. We like the president’s stand on Iran, slowly but steadily undermining the Iranian economy rather than launching a premature military strike and setting off another Middle East war. In contrast, Romney and his supporters have rattled the saber at Iran. Despite Romney’s efforts in the last few days to tone it down as he tacks to the middle, his foreign policy seems to come straight from George W. Bush. Some of Romney’s foreign-policy advisers are the former Bush neo-conservatives who got us into the unnecessary Iraq war. We like Obama’s health-care plan, finding it far better than that offered by Romney, even if it is largely based on Romney’s own Massachusetts program. We see no sign that Romney, should he succeed in repealing “Obamacare,” would succeed in balancing the many competing health-care interests that Obama worked into a compromise. We fear that Romney would turn Medicare into a voucher program that would not match the full cost of private insurance for the seniors. His hybrid plan would drive the sickest Americans into a government plan and let the insurance companies cherry-pick the healthiest clients. On education, Romney, just as Republican leaders here, seems to believe that if we continue to cut public education, we will somehow educate our young well enough. And on the environment, we’re concerned that Romney would gut protections Obama has restored. Obama has a keen vision that he has worked hard to achieve, against considerable obstacles and often courageously. But the goal is in sight: An America respected worldwide as much for its prosperity as its defense of liberty and justice. The Journal editorial board endorses Barack Obama for president.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350252829625</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:13:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350252995962-52</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo October Surprise</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349217091512</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 18:31:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Race baiting and class warfare are the same 2 tired answers we Liberal Idiots have for any question you might ask.</Msg><Username>delusional_left</Username><Timestamp>1350252995962</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:16:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350253094890-53</Id><Topic><Title>Hi, I am the rich, Chicago, Occupy-Loving, Facist Traitor Ordering Totalitarianism!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349990818606</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 17:26:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Alla akbar and GOD DAMN AMERIKKKA !!</Msg><Username>delusional_left</Username><Timestamp>1350253094890</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:18:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350253748287-54</Id><Topic><Title>North Carolina paper for BO</Title><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350252829625</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:13:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's in the deep red south!!!</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1350253748287</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 18:29:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350254677562-55</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo October Surprise</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349217091512</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 18:31:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm so glad you bumped this post!

That hardly makes him unusual in mainstream media circles. What is unusual, though, is the column he just penned for The Daily Mail. The headline says it all, "He's one of the least principled politicians I've met. But I believe Mitt Romney might just save America." Morgan doubles down on Romney's image as a flip-flopper, but he goes on to salute Romney as a man, father and husband and remind us the GOP presidential candidate is particularly brilliant at making broken things run again. The main concern for Americans right now is the economy, after all. I asked Bill Clinton recently if he felt Romney was a ‘principled man’ and Clinton smiled: ‘That’s not the issue to me.’ And I suspect it’s not for most voters either. They just want to know which man, Romney or Obama, is going to revive the economy faster.... ....The great messianic tidal wave of optimism Obama swept in on has been replaced by harsh reality.He promised Americans tremendous ‘hope’ and ‘change’ and, frankly, they don’t feel he’s given them much hope, or changed very much... ....But – and it’s a big but – unemployment is still running at a scarily high 7.8 per cent, meaning 23 million Americans are out of work. Meanwhile, the country’s national debt has risen to a staggering $16 TRILLION, up $5 trillion from when Obama took over. Factor in a still severely deflated housing market, and petrol prices double what they were in 2008, and it all adds up to a pretty miserable economic picture. [Romney] sees America as a struggling company, and himself as therefore the perfect person to rescue it. That’s where Romney can win. His track record as a businessman is better than almost any presidential candidate ever.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1350257264346</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 19:27:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350259387943-60</Id><Title>Who's lying this time?</Title><Msg>Ohio Coal Miners Condemn Obama’s 'Absolute lies' and Sherrod Brown, too by William Bigelow14 Oct 2012, The coal miners of Ohio, unlike some workers who are intimidated by their unions, are unafraid of standing tall and confronting the Obama Administration head-on. Last Wednesday, more than 500 coal miners who work at the Beallsville, Ohio Century Mine, operated by Murray Energy, held a rally to condemn the Obama Administration’s despicable ad claiming the miners were coerced into attending a rally for Mitt Romney on August 14. They also charged Obama with waging a war on coal. The Obama campaign had seized on rumors started by a local shock jock, David Bloomquist, who claimed the miners had been forced to attend the Romney rally. Mitch Miracle, speaking for the miners, read aloud the two letters they had written and signed. The letter to Obama read like this: Dear President Obama:. We are writing as the employees of American Energy Century Mine in Beallsville, Ohio. You have approved in a running television campaign ads about the Mitt Romney event that was held at our Century coal mine. These ads state that we were forced to attend this rally and that is blatantly false. There are numerous false statements and absolute lies concerning our participation in this event, we, the employees, mostly started by a local shock jock host. Since your approval is attached to these ads, you may not wish to support these mistruths. Why would you lie about the 500 working miners who have signed this letter? We, the employees of Century Mine, would request you immediately stop these false ads. Thank you. Century Mine employees. The letter to Bloomquist read: Mr. Bloomquist; We are writing to you regarding the Governor Mitt Romney event held on August 14, 2012 at the American Energy Corporation Century mine, and additionally what it meant to the hourly employees to host a presidential candidate that we believe in and endorse. We voluntarily and enthusiastically attended the event and take great offense to the disingenuous reporting of the event by you and other media outlets. There are 5 points in particular that I want to make here: the following are a list of facts about the hourly employees’ involvement at that event and the corrections to the media’s inaccurate reporting: One: we want to make it very clear that no employee was forced to attend the event. Secondly, there were no attendance records taken for hourly employees. Number three, there are absolutely no penalties or reprimands to those who did not attend- we voluntarily attended. Number 4, due to security reasons, the only list involved whatsoever was for transportation purposes, and this was thoroughly explained to us; this had to be done by the advance team of Mr. Romney. They had to have records of who was coming on the property. Number 5; it was an honor to host this important event for Governor Romney. Your so-called sources have made accusations against our company yet remain unnamed. We have proudly signed our names to this statement. These so-called sources are likely discharged or disgruntled former employees. This was a great day, for the employees of American energy, and your negative one-sided reporting has created a disservice to our company and to us, the employees. You see, Mr. Bloomquist, there is a war on coal and we do want to protect our jobs. Mining jobs are being eliminated and coal fired power plants are being shut down from the President Obama’s actions and policies. We, the undersigned, support Governor Romney and reject President Obama and those like Sherrod Brown who are job killers. In summary, we, the employees of AEC, these great men behind me, our spouses, our children, our parents and our grandparents thoroughly enjoyed this event, a once in a lifetime event, right here, in the Ohio Valley. This is our statement, our choices, and our signatures. Mr. Bloomquist, your shock-jock tactics offend the undersigned, and I have attached our employees and our signatures. Miracle eloquently concluded: In closing, standing behind me are proud Americans, proud coal miners proud citizens of this great country, proud members of the Ohio Valley, where we live in and I am damn proud of them. Proud Ohio Valley workers. As you all know the economy has been tough for all of us; this is a great profession, these are great workers and we are proud to be a part of it, part of Murray Energy and we support our owner 100 percent. We ask that the media, let’s embrace coal, embrace what it does for all of us. Let’s be together in what we do. You don’t have to be a coal miner to stand up and cheer for these men fighting for the truth. You just have to be a real American.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1350259387943</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:03:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350261996421-61</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Sees Big Lead w/Early Voters</Title><Username>mittins_da_wimpins</Username><Timestamp>1350224756416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 10:25:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I'm always hesitant to disillusion people" LOL !!!!!!!!!!!

Coal Miner’s Donor A Mitt Romney benefactor and his surprisingly generous employees. Alec MacGillis October 4, 2012 Gordon Studer IT IS BOTH a pundit’s truism and a mathematical reality that Mitt Romney’s path to the White House runs through Ohio. And that path, in turn, runs through a firm called Murray Energy. Over the years, CEO Robert Murray has brought in GOP pols from as far away as Alaska, California, and Massachusetts for fund-raisers. In 2010, the year John Boehner became House speaker, the firm’s 3,000 employees and their families were his second-biggest source of funds. (AT&amp;T was in first place, but it has nearly 200,000 employees.) This year, Murray is one of the most important GOP players in one of the most important battleground states in the country. In May, he hosted a $1.7 million fund-raiser for Romney. Employees have given the nominee more than $120,000. In August, Romney used Murray’s Century Mine in the town of Beallsville for a speech attacking Barack Obama as anti-coal. This fall, scenes from that event—several dozen coal-smudged Murray miners standing behind the candidate in a tableau framed by a giant American flag and a COAL COUNTRY STANDS WITH MITT placard—have shown up in a Romney ad. The ads aired even after Ohio papers reported what I was told by several miners at the event, a bit of news that an internal memo confirms: The crowd was not there of its own accord. Murray had suspended Century’s operations and made clear to workers that they were expected to attend, without pay. “I tell ya, you’ve got a great boss,” Romney said in acknowledging Robert Murray from the stage. “He runs a great operation here.” The accounts of two sources who have worked in managerial positions at the firm, and a review of letters and memos to Murray employees, suggest that coercion may also explain Murray staffers’ financial support for Romney. Murray, it turns out, has for years pressured salaried employees to give to the Murray Energy political action committee (PAC) and to Republican candidates chosen by the company. Internal documents show that company officials track who is and is not giving. The sources say that those who do not give are at risk of being demoted or missing out on bonuses, claims Murray denies. The Murray sources, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, came forward separately. But they painted similar pictures of the fund-raising operation. “There’s a lot of coercion,” says one of them. “I just wanted to work, but you feel this constant pressure that, if you don’t contribute, your job’s at stake. You’re compelled to do this whether you want to or not.” Says the second: “They will give you a call if you’re not giving. . . . It’s expected you give Mr. Murray what he asks for.” And what he asks for offers a lesson for 2012: Even in a year of hyperventilation about super PACs, dubious older ways of raising political dollars still matter. BOB MURRAY, WHO is 72, is a legendary figure in Appalachian coal country. He hails from three generations of miners in southeastern Ohio; his father was paralyzed in a mining accident when Bob was nine. Murray himself has been injured while working below ground. Unlike his forefathers, though, Murray became a suit. He won a scholarship to study mine engineering and eventually rose to chief executive of North American Coal. In the late 1980s, he took out personal loans to start Murray Energy, which has grown to own eight mines in six states. It is the largest privately held coal-mining concern in the country. Like a lot of mining executives, Murray’s a ferocious critic of federal mining regulations—even after the 2007 collapse at his Crandall Canyon mine in Utah, where nine people died. He also knows how to throw his weight around. In 2001, he sued the Akron Beacon Journal for $1 billion after a critical profile; that same year, he was acquitted of assault charges after allegedly throwing an environmental activist against a wall. In 2002, local media reported that he warned off mine safety inspectors with this line: “Mitch McConnell calls me one of the five finest men in America, and the last I checked, he was sleeping with your boss,” referring to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, the senator’s wife. (Murray denied the account.) Murray’s fiery streak was on full display after the Crandall Canyon collapse. Wearing his trademark sweater-vest, he angrily insisted to reporters that the collapse had been caused by an earthquake—scientists disagreed—and railed against efforts to curb carbon emissions. At one point, he pulled back his collar to show the scar from his mining accident. In southeastern Ohio, Murray’s dominance evokes an earlier era. Miners at the Century event told me he treats them well and aspires to know all their names. But the paternalism also features some unmistakable messaging. A huge sign draped outside Murray’s Powhatan No. 6 Mine—the only unionized facility among Murray’s properties—reads: SAVE EASTERN OHIO: FIRE OBAMA. At Century, a lobby notice tells employees where to call to order yard signs with the slogan STOP THE WAR ON COAL: FIRE OBAMA. The message apparently gets through. Since 2007, employees of Murray Energy and its subsidiaries, along with their families and the Murray PAC, have contributed over $1.4 million to Republican candidates for federal office. Murray’s fund-raisers have feted the likes of Scott Brown, Rand Paul, David Vitter, Carly Fiorina, and Jim DeMint. Home-state pols get love, too. Murray’s PAC and staffers are the sixth-largest source for Ohio senatorial hopeful Josh Mandel. They’ve given $720,000 to candidates for state office in the past decade. Internal Murray documents show just how upset Murray becomes when employees fail to join the giving. In missives, he cajoles employees to attend fund-raisers and scolds them when they or their subordinates do not. In cases of low participation, reminders from his lieutenants have included tables or spreadsheets showing how each of the eleven Murray subsidiaries was performing. And at least one note came with a list of names of employees who had not yet given. “What is so difficult about asking a well-paid, salaried employee to give us three hours of his/her time every two months?” Murray writes in a March 2012 letter. “We have been insulted by every salaried employee who does not support our efforts.” He concludes: “I do not recall ever seeing the attached list of employees . . . at one of our fund-raisers.” Here’s what stubborn employees missed: The events are typically at Undo’s, an Italian restaurant and banquet hall in St. Clairsville. Dinner is pasta and salad. There’s a cash bar. There’s a receiving line. There are speeches by the visiting beneficiary who generally extols coal. (Employees in Ohio also get invitations to fund-raisers near Murray’s southern Illinois mine; they’re not expected to attend, but are encouraged to send checks.) The ritual becomes expensive for Murray’s engineers, surveyors, and accountants. “People are very upset about being constantly asked for the checks, because people have lives and families and expenses,” says the first source, a political independent. “They say, ‘This isn’t right. . . . I don’t think they’re allowed to do this.’ Most people do it grudgingly.” Those who decline, the source says, prepare to be questioned. “When they’re pressuring people to write checks, if they haven’t by the deadline, you hear people making excuses—I just had to repair my car, I had an unexpected bill, I just had to pay tuition.” And yet the tin-cupping continues. “I am asking you to rally all of your salaried employees and have them make their contribution to our event as soon as possible,” Murray writes in a letter to managers ahead of a 2011 fund-raiser for Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker and Tennessee Senator Bob Corker. “Please see that our salaried employees ‘step up,’ for their own sakes and those of their employees.” A September 2010 letter lamenting insufficient contributions to the company PAC is more pointed. “The response to this letter of appeal has been poor,” Murray writes. “We have only a little over a month left to go in this election fight. If we do not win it, the coal industry will be eliminated and so will your job, if you want to remain in this industry.” The pressure to give begins as soon as employees enter the company, the Murray sources say. At the time of hiring, supervisors tell employees that they are expected to contribute to the company PAC by automatic payroll deduction—typically 1 percent of their salary, a level confirmed by a 2008 letter to employees from the PAC’s treasurer. (That letter also assures employees that they would not be “disadvantaged” by not giving.) Employees are given a form to sign, explaining that the giving is voluntary. “In the interview . . . I was told that I would be expected to make political contributions—that [Murray] just expected that,” says the first source. “But I was told not to worry about it, because my bonuses would more than make up what I would be asked to contribute.” Later, the sources say, Murray sends letters to employees’ homes asking them to give to specific candidates. The letters feature suggested amounts depending on their salary level—one middle manager was encouraged to give $200 to then–Oregon Senator Gordon Smith—and include forms to fill out and return, with checks, to Murray headquarters. The letters come with great frequency. Before the 2008 election, there were nine fund-raisers in less than three months. Guests included then–New Hampshire Senator John E. Sununu, then–Alaska Senator Ted Stevens, and Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe. Murray’s exhortations demonstrate more attention to ideology than to Strunk &amp; White. In August 2011, Murray urged employees to attend a $2,500 fundraiser for Rick Perry, “likely to be the Republican Nominee to defeat the destructive Barack Obama.” And for the unconvinced, he attached a “brief, partial listing of the destruction that Barack Obama has reeked.” Murray employees and their households came through, becoming Perry’s second-largest source for funds in the entire country. After Perry dropped out, Murray switched to Romney. In his April letter for the fund-raiser the next month, he told employees, “America needs business and job creation, not the ruthless destruction that we are seeing from Barack Obama and his Democrats supporters, whom are Hollywood characters, liberal elitists, radical environmentalists, unionists, and Americans who do not want to work.” IN THE AGE of Citizens United, there’s something a bit quaint about political giving via a corporate PAC or from donations rustled up from workers. But the structure still holds appeal. While a CEO could simply write a huge check to a candidate’s super PAC, urging employees to give not only avoids drawing undue attention to the boss, but it also provides an appearance of broader support for the candidate and offers that candidate more control over the funds. Murray Energy general counsel Mike McKown says the firm’s approach to political giving complies with federal laws. Employees are not required to give to the PAC, he says, nor are they reimbursed. “We follow carefully the FEC [Federal Election Commission] rules about what employees can be solicited and how they can be solicited,” he says, adding that Bob Murray’s encouragement for employees to contribute to individual candidates is the CEO’s personal endeavor. “The PAC and Mr. Murray’s fundraising are kept separate,” he says. So how does that comport with the memos urging division heads to get their underlings to pony up or the spreadsheets letting foot-draggers know that the company’s keeping track of who’s not giving? “It’s my understanding that the employees are encouraged to give, and he is enthusiastic about people giving contributions,” McKown says. “As far as utilizing internal company assets to further his company fund-raising, that’s all done within FEC guidelines.” There is no punishment or reward related to fund-raising, McKown says. “I’ve never ever seen people pay any consequence for giving or not giving to this PAC or events.” McKown says the two sources who suggest generous employees get bigger bonuses are just wrong. “It’s Mr. Murray’s view of what the employee’s contribution was to the company that month,” he says. The law around employee political contributions has its gray areas. The bottom line, says Paul S. Ryan, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, is that employers can’t reimburse donations and the “folks running a corporate PAC cannot make a contribution to that PAC a condition of employment.” But the tricky thing in many cases is that a boss’s enthusiastic suggestion comes across as something more. An authorization form does not necessarily get an employer off the hook, he says. “It can’t involve twisting arms.” The Murray pressure, the sources say, extends to contractors as well. “They have to write big checks or they don’t do business with Murray Energy,” the first source explains. “They see it as an investment, as the cost of doing business,” says the second source, a lifelong Republican. One Murray vendor who is also a big GOP donor paints a less sinister picture. “Bob Murray’s no different than if it was the Democratic or Republican Party—they’re always encouraging you to support their candidates,” says Jimmy Phillips, the co-owner of Phillips Machine Service, where employees have given nearly $400,000 this election cycle. “We are very free to do what we want to.” McKown also says there’s no there there: “The letters that go out to vendors are the same as the ones that go to employees—they say, ‘Give what you can, if you can.’ ” It’s not surprising that some of those with whom I spoke after Romney visited the mine said they had no problem with the contributions. Shawn Ray, a former general manager of Murray’s surface-mining operation, cast the spreadsheets as “just a competition amongst the guys,” not a sign of pressure. “It was so you know how you do against the other companies. The pressure to give is not so much for the company to give; it’s so we’re doing our part. It’s sort of personal for us.” Others were more wary about discussing the fund-raising. After the rally, a veteran Murray engineer told me that “they like for you to [participate]. It’s not a requirement, but they like you to go.” When I asked him how he was able to afford the contributions, he gave a taut smile. “That’s enough,” he said. On the rope line after the rally, I sought out Murray as he greeted his workers. I asked the CEO why so many people had turned out for the rally. “They’re frightened,” he said. “They’re afraid for their jobs and their livelihoods. They’re frightened, and I’m frightened for them.” Alec MacGillis is a senior editor at The New Republic.

The Most Vile Lie of All. Sun Oct 14, 2012 at 04:33 AM PDT Mitt Romney. The Most Vile Lie of All. by LaFeminista This is not a mere pants on fire lie. “We don’t have a setting across this country where if you don’t have insurance, we just say to you, ‘Tough luck, you’re going to die when you have your heart attack,’  ” he said as he offered more hints as to what he would put in place of “Obamacare,” which he has pledged to repeal. “No, you go to the hospital, you get treated, you get care, and it’s paid for, either by charity, the government or by the hospital. We don’t have people that become ill, who die in their apartment because they don’t have insurance.” This is as heartless and disgusting a lie as is possible From a Harvard study The lack of health insurance is associated with as many as 44789 deaths per year in the United States Or more simply put 1000 deaths for every one million uninsured each year. So every year we refuse to accept the concept of universal health care, as every other civilized country has applied, this unnecessary death toll mounts. The right scream about the right to life and pro-life, yet this simple idea eludes them. When you talk about repealing Obamacare in its entirety. When you talk about eliminating planned parenthood. You are condemning people to death. You are condemning people to needless pain and misery. You are creating millions of grieving relatives. You are condemning people to economic oblivion. This goes beyond mere political "untruth" and enters into the world of criminal negligence. The reality is people are dying every day because the most expensive health care system in the world does not work. This health care system bleeds the economy dry and it destroys lives. It is time that the politics of division ended and the reality of this nightmare laid bare. It is time for a health care system that serves all Americans. So #$%$ Mitt Romney and your disgusting lies. 5:01 AM PT: H/T to this addition in the comments It's not only his most vile lie- (2+ / 0-) it's also his most irresponsible. He told a national audience that if they use the ER for medical care, they won't have to pay for it. Too many people already believe that, and are shocked when the bills and collection notices arrive. Spreading that lie is a great way to put even more people on the path to bankruptcy.</Msg><Username>spenditol98_1</Username><Timestamp>1350263409531</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 21:10:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350263503056-66</Id><Topic><Title>Who's lying this time?</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1350259387943</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 20:03:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Quit wif all the long posts, few will read that many lies and much filth at one time.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1350263503056</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-14 21:11:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350268254562-67</Id><Title>Neverending GOP voter fraud</Title><Msg>Ohio Voter Fraud Billboards Targeting Black Voters Will Stay, Says Clear Channel Clear Channel was asked by voting rights advocates and local politicians to remove billboard advertisements that unfairly target minority communities with the threat that “voter fraud is a felony” with “up to 3 1/2 yrs &amp; $10,000 Fine.” Despite public outrage and the potential threat of voter intimidation, the anonymously funded billboards will stay, according to the Washington Post.
