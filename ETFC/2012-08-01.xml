They all made poor decisions last summer to the detriment of all shareholders including kenneth griffun. Now we sit with a company with a vastly better statement of position, but also with economic headwinds pushing against trading volumes. The best thing to do is sell the brokerage and the bank and get the ultimate value for these assets as soon as possible. Doubtful that kenneth griffun will tolerate another season of lies from this management team and Goldman Sax. Kenny must know there is a deal in the works or he would be sounding off like a raped ape. Horrible to consider, but management has presented regulators with a capital plan. That cannot be good as none of this company's plans have ever gone in the favor of the shareholders.

The company blamed much of the drop from a year ago on reduced sales to rental car companies. But retail sales to individual buyers fell 3 percent. GM's sales continued to lag growth in the overall market. Analysts expected total U.S. sales to be up 11 percent over the same month last year. Sales of the Chevrolet Cruze compact fell more than 39 percent. It was the top-selling compact in July of last year.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343846796000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 14:46:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343846964000-43</Id><Topic><Title>Obama success story</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343846796000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 14:46:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Time for an other stimulus BAILOUT program for the GM UNIONS or less votes for the democRATS and OBIMBORAMA!!! ;o) ROWDY!!!</Msg><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1343846964000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 14:49:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343847041000-44</Id><Topic><Title>Chick-Fil-A</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1343846503000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 14:41:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea, hetrophobic fascist bigots the lot of them.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343847041000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 14:50:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343847329000-45</Id><Topic><Title>Obama success story</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343846796000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 14:46:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rumney has the midas touch.

His campaign’s chief operating officer said on Monday that “we’ve gotten our behinds handed to us.” Vice President Joe Biden warned on the same day that Mr. Obama would lose if “the other side spends us into oblivion.” Michele Obama worried aloud about waking up on election day “wondering if I could have done more.” And Al Gore, the former vice president, said victories by the “extremist fringe” would “spell disaster” for the country. The answer, according to all of them? A donation of $3 (or more) by midnight on Tuesday. (The e-mails don’t say “Pretty please!” — yet.) The urgent and repeated appeals, sent to millions of Mr. Obama’s supporters via e-mail and text messages, are a vivid reminder that the president’s campaign is likely to raise significantly less than Mitt Romney and Republicans for the third month in a row in July.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343850638000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 15:50:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343850890000-61</Id><Topic><Title>Obama panhandling</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343850638000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 15:50:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's always got his freakin' hand out.
