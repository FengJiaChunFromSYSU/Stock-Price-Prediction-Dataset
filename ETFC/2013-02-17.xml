A stock tends to be more heavily traded during the weeks immediately following the earnings cycle, and sometimes fading interest combined with profit taking allows choice between earnings deals for the patient investor. And, by the book, there is NOTHING wrong with averaging a position UP, nor, if you were going to take the entire position for a long term ride to begin with, averaging down, provided there is real value there for your money. Value that I agree this stock has. Good luck though, not that you'll need it on this one, just alittle time.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1361123575702</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 12:52:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361133183781-4</Id><Topic><Title>John McCain: Chuck Hagel Will Likely Be Confirmed</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1361131725194</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 15:08:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Republican field is large enough to pick someone who is not upset with jewish lobby in US government. Democrat field is wide open too, there are many who are not anti-Semites. We are better off with Panetta, at least he understands that sequestration is bad for the military. Now, how many Supreme Court nominees were filibustered by Democrats in the Senate under Bush? Do we need functional judicial branch too? Well, at least W showed some flexibility by making another nomination. For Obama it is all about making GOP look bad. Country in front of ideology? We wouldn't add nearly as much to national debt if this president would really care about the country. He doesn't.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1361133183781</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 15:33:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361142430490-5</Id><Topic><Title>Up 96% since Obama took office</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1360807152420</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 20:59:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We all know that was a spike due to oil disruption threrats, so stop with the obfuscation.

I invested in RSH hoping the CEO could turn it around, but when he left and they hired a faithless pogue who lied about their dividend intentions I dropped it like a rock instead of "waiting to break even". I mean, what's the point, as if you think a company is doomed to failure then likely others are reaching the same conclusion and already beginning to divest their interest. Waiting only leaves you a bagholder, so instead you should be selling this recent pop and then, if you want to try to recover some losses, buy back in on a hard drop and ride the bouncing cat to additional profits, or, even a better idea, just eat the loss and move on to a stock with a more stable future that's also ready for a bounce. I ditched the Shack and lost a TON of money, so much that it wiped out all my other gains for the year and that again in realized losses. But, if I'd stayed in, I would have been sitting on dead money for months and wouldn't have made the subsequent realized and unrealized gains that made up almost all that loss in the last few months. Never hold onto what you think is a loser just to "get even" as if you're right about it being a loser all you'll do is "get screwed".</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1361155244405</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-17 21:40:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
