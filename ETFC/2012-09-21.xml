Participants in the closed-door meeting described a brief, upbeat address that focused on defining the race as a close contest between two distinct visions for the country. “This is going to be an up and down race,” Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, said during an appearance at the last scheduled weekly meeting of House Republicans before Election Day, according to multiple people in the room.

They’re drowning in it.” When he said this (that 47% have abdicated personal responsibility for their lives), Romney didn’t just write off half the country behind closed doors. He also confirmed the worst suspicions about who he is: an entitled rich guy with no understanding of how people who aren’t rich actually live. The thing about not having much money is you have to take much more responsibility for your life. You can’t pay people to watch your kids or clean your house or fix your meals. You can’t necessarily afford a car or a washing machine or a home in a good school district. That’s what money buys you: goods and services that make your life easier. The problem is that he doesn’t seem to realize how difficult it is to focus on college when you’re also working full time, how much planning it takes to reliably commute to work without a car, or the agonizing choices faced by families in which both parents work and a child falls ill. The working poor haven’t abdicated responsibility for their lives. They’re drowning in it. The point here isn’t that Romney is unfamiliar with cutting-edge work in cognitive psychology. It’s that he misses even the intuitive message of this work, the part most of us know without reading any studies: It’s really, really hard to be poor. That’s because the poorer you are, the more personal responsibility you have to take.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1348209058011</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 02:30:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348234853674-5</Id><Topic><Title>Thurston Howell Romney</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348176110259</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 17:21:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney and Ryan publically say they want to save social security and medicare, but privately they denounce the programs as "socialistic" , "collectivist".....and that people on them are freeloading "entitlement" moochers.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1348234853674</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 09:40:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348236213844-6</Id><Title>Fee fight facts from the "Fool'</Title><Msg>Who Will Win This Fierce Fee Fight? By Dan Caplinger | More Articles September 21, 2012 | Comments (0) Smart investors make big demands on the brokers they use. Smart brokers respond by giving their customers what they really want. Over the past three years, brokerage companies have fought among themselves to attract customers by offering deals on the most popular product to hit the financial world in years: exchange-traded funds. Now that the players involved have drawn most of the battle lines, though, one brokerage company is refocusing its efforts and aiming to solidify its status as the lowest-cost provider in the ETF market. That company is Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW ) . A history of the broker wars Late in 2009, Schwab made what seemed to be an innocuous announcement: It decided to offer its own line of ETFs. Given that a number of other providers, including Vanguard, State Street's (NYSE: STT ) SPDRs, and the iShares line of funds from BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) , had already ramped up their ETF offerings, Schwab's new ETFs didn't look like anything special. But Schwab came up with an innovative pitch to its customer base: Buy Schwab's ETFs in a Schwab account and pay no commission. It was an obvious way to build up customer loyalty for products that were starting from scratch, and given how crowded the ETF industry already was, Schwab's move was a masterstroke that gave it a big advantage over other companies trying to attract capital and build funds from the ground up. Quickly, other brokers followed suit with commission-free ETFs of their own. Fidelity partnered with iShares, while Vanguard offered its own funds. Slowly but surely, most of the rest of the industry, including Scottrade, TD Ameritrade (NYSE: AMTD ) , and E*TRADE Financial (Nasdaq: ETFC ) , came up with partnerships or other ETFs on a no-commission basis. But what about cost? Yet commissions are only one aspect of the cost equation for ETF investors. You also have to worry about the annual fees that ETFs charge their customers for management and other expenses. One of the initial attractions of ETFs was how much less costly they were than actively traded mutual funds. Because most ETFs track indexes, the job of ETF managers is far simpler than those that have to pick stocks on their own initiative. Over time, though, ever more specialized ETFs have sometimes charged higher prices as fund managers sought to maximize revenue amid intense competition for assets under management. However, at the other end of the cost spectrum, Schwab, Vanguard, and Scottrade's FocusShares have fought a battle for the ETFs with the cheapest fees. In its latest salvo, Schwab has made some huge moves to make ETF investing cheaper. In particular, here's what Schwab has done: Cut its bradest-market U.S. stck funds' expense ratis t 0.04%. Slashed large-cap and mid-cap fferings nearly in half t 0.07%. Dramatically drpped expense ratis n internatinal ETFs, including emerging markets. Cut its bradest bnd ETFs' fees in half. As a result of the move, many of Schwab's fees now undercut Vanguard substantially, despite Vanguard's reputation as a low-cost provider. With FocusShares ETFs having shut their doors after failing to attract enough assets to make them economically viable, the spotlight will be on Vanguard to see whether, or how, it responds to Schwab's moves. Diminishing returns As important as low costs are, it's important to keep some perspective here. Schwab's cuts on its broad-market ETF amounted to two hundredths of a percentage point, or $2 annually on a $10,000 investment. I like having $2 better than not having $2, but for many investors of modest means, ETF costs have gotten so low that the differences are minuscule. Still, if you're looking for ways to simplify your investing, commission-free ETFs can be a valuable tool in your investment arsenal. The right broker can jump-start your saving and get you on your way to your financial goals.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348236213844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 10:03:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348236323070-7</Id><Topic><Title>Rats abandoning the SS GOP</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348179868658</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 18:24:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>\\\Paul Ryan urges House colleagues to remain optimistic about election/// Ryan: Hey, Guys ...... don't go.... stay..... we have another "campaign reboot" due in just few days..... everything will be better in our 'Romney_Ryan_campaign_version_9.924.3258.556481b' ...

A lot richer. Forbes reports that the wealth of 400 wealthiest people in America jumped by 13 percent over the past year to an astounding $1.7 TRILLION. And we know that six of those of people — six of the very, very wealthiest people in America — paid absolutely no federal income taxes. We certainly haven’t heard Mitt Romney complaining about those people. As Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) said on the Senate floor yesterday, those six ultra-wealthy individuals aren’t the only wealthy Americans who aren’t paying federal income taxes: “For all we know, Mitt Romney could be one of those who have paid no federal income tax. Thousands of families making more than $1 million pay nothing in federal income taxes each year… Is Mitt Romney among those? We’ll never know, since he refuses to release tax returns from the years before he was running for president.” All of this stands in marked contrast to the average American, including many that Romney attacked, whose household income actually fell over the past year. Why are the wealthy getting so much wealthier so quickly? A lot of reasons, but one reason is that it’s really the wealthy who get the vast majority of tax breaks in this country. As an independent study by the Tax Policy Center found, the other 53 percent receive their own form government assistance: they disproportionately benefit from the federal government’s $1.08 trillion annual allocation for tax breaks:</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348237641986</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 10:27:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348241935996-11</Id><Topic><Title>Fee fight facts from the "Fool'</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348236213844</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 10:03:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Schwab CEO Bettinger: After Fee Cuts, ‘Not Going To Stop Here’ By Brendan Conway Charles Schwab (SCHW) president and chief executive Walt Bettinger touted his company’s commitment to low-cost investing the morning after the company cut ETF fees across its line of 15 products, and pledged that the company is “not going to stop here.” The cuts included lowering two broad equity ETFs to an industry-low cost of four basis points, or 0.04%. Asked whether the comments meant more price cuts could be coming in the future, Bettinger left the door open. “Sometimes it may take the form of fee cuts, sometimes additional services,” he said. “We’ll respond in whatever way is appropriate in the competitive environment.” How can Schwab make any money on ETFs when its most popular fund charges 0.04% a year? “It’s like asking Apple [AAPL] if they make money on the glass screen on the iPhone,” Bettinger said on the Friday morning conference call with reporters. “We don’t evaluate individual products in isolation.

The Schwab announcement, which comes just a week after BlackRock CEO Larry Fink announced fee cuts for some core iShares ETFs. The cuts by Schwab bring the weighted average fee for all Schwab ETFs to 0.077%. That’s Vanguard territory – the low-cost area historically dominated by Jack Bogle’s famously low-fee firm. Now, Vangaurd and other ETF sellers find themselves under pressure from firms like Schwab, who, despite being a somewhat small player in the ETF space, are willing to “race to the bottom” to win over customer loyalty. Schwab initiated another sort of price war in 2009 when it became the first major brokerage to offer commission-free ETF trading online. Other companies have followed suit, with E*trade, Fidelity, FirstTrade, Scottrade, TD Ameritrade and Vanguard all offering commission-free trading on a selection of ETFs. Vanguard announced earlier this year that its Vanguard 500 Index ETF will charge only a .05% fee. Schwab announced to that its US Large-Cap ETF, along with its largest fund, the US Broad Market ETF, will charge only .04%. These are barrel-scraping fees. Schwab’s fee cuts range from 25% to nearly 60% across its ETF offerings. The company boasts that its 15 ETFs now offer the lowest fees in each of their Lipper categories. When asked if Schwab Funds is able to turn a profit on ETF products – a concern echoed by many in the industry, CEO Walt Bettinger seemed to treat ETFs as more of a loss leader and part of Schwab’s complete offering, although he did say the products affect the company’s bottom line positively. “It’s like asking Apple if they make money on the glass of an iPhone,” said Bettinger. “If I’m running Apple, I’m worried about building a client base that loves Apple products. At Schwab, we’re worried about delighting investors and building our franchise.” Additionally, Bettinger revealed that the company is planning to offer an ETF-only 401(k) option for investors looking to save for retirement using exchange traded funds. Although he couldn’t pin down an exact date for the launch of said funds, Bettinger estimated a late 2013 or early 2014 launch."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348243177043</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:59:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348244376314-14</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC Question</Title><Username>cohsgrad</Username><Timestamp>1348243141954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:59:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obviously this is the board for all things politics.

The wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, during a sit-down interview with CBS 58 in Milwaukee, was asked about the second-guessing within the GOP's tent over the campaign. "You know there is always sniping and everyone always thinks they are the best critic, and they know this and they know that," she said. "And you know what, it is really amazing to me that people forget that what this election really is about is the economy." In an interview with Radio Iowa, she was more forceful. "Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring,” she said. “This is hard and, you know, it’s an important thing that we’re doing right now and it’s an important election and it is time for all Americans to realize how significant this election is and how lucky we are to have someone with Mitt’s qualifications and experience and know-how to be able to have the opportunity to run this country." Mitt Romney has largely been diplomatic when read back some of the complaints that Republicans, whether they be Senate candidates distancing themselves from his remarks or columnists complaining that his campaign is inept. Usually, he concedes that his statement -- declaring that 47 percent of the country was government-dependent, self-identified victims -- was inarticulate, then moves on. Ann Romney's remarks suggest rather strongly that both her husband and his campaign are more aggrieved by the words coming from fellow Republicans.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348254102709</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 15:01:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348254305334-21</Id><Topic><Title>Obama, the truth teller.</Title><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1348251111811</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:11:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In that interview he was still cling to that lame claim that the "video" was the cause of the murders.

At this point, one would think the "walk away" defaults would be tapering off as the port is about 5-6 years old. As long as people keeps their jobs you could assume they will keep paying. Now on the home prices. Etrade purchased much of this portfolio from 3rd parties and many were "no doc" loans or the worst kind. The largest concentration is in California. If house prices have dropped 30-40% since 06/07 then a small increase in home prices is not really going to move the needle. The HELOCs are the bigger concern as those are way underwater and odds of any recovery on a default is slim and none. Then add in the lack of trading headwinds with darts last months at 120k or about one half of the brisk pace back in 2009. Low interest rates are the other killer with etrade re-investing the cash from loan roll offs in agency backed MBS. That product is right where the fed is buying 45bil a month with the new QE program. That will make those rates go even lower and thus etrade will receive less interest income. The upside is the possible re-fi of the high interest debt along with being able to upstream capital.

Nevertheless, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) is vowing that even if President Obama is reelected, Republicans will not budge on their refusal to raise taxes on wealthy Americans. At a press conference Friday morning, a reporter asked Boehner whether Republicans were "eventually going to have to raise taxes in some way" if the president wins in November. "No," replied Boehner. "Raising taxes, according to Ernst and Young, would threaten our economy with a loss of 700,000 jobs. Now why would I ever be for something like that? I'm not." Boehner's stand-firm stance is not shared by all of his caucus. According to the Washington Post, "senior Republicans in the House and the Senate" admit that if the president is reelected, he will have leverage to push for allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire on income above $250,000.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1348268445638</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 19:00:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348268999079-37</Id><Topic><Title>GOP pledges eternal loyalty to their base</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1348268445638</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 19:00:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looky here ...that's the problem....you guys are too focused on how others should be taxed to make your lifes better instead of you guys just stepping up to the plate to be succesful for yourself......worrying about your neighboror just the people in the upper crust is not productive for you..i repeat not productive for you......focus your energy to make yourself better instead of tearing others down is in your best interest...quit being a derelect.........dam</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1348268999079</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 19:09:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348269105203-38</Id><Topic><Title>The rumor du jour</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348266735166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 18:32:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cooking the Books At long last (and late on a Friday afternoon) Mitt Romney finally decided to let the public see just one additional tax return, his 2011 filing. Here's the rundown. What It Tells Us Mitt Romney "paid $1,935,708 in taxes on $13,696,951 in mostly investment income." Mitt Romney paid a tax rate of just 14.1 percent.* A Gigantic Asterisk Earlier this year, Romney said he had paid at least 13 percent in taxes every year for the past decade. The truth is that his tax rate for 2011 would've been around 9-10 percent. So today Romney cooked his tax return and used an accounting trick to pay more than he actually owed in order to generate better headlines. None other than Mitt Romney himself said just a few months ago that doing just that would disqualify him from being president: "I don’t pay more than are legally due and frankly if I had paid more than are legally due I don’t think I’d be qualified to become president. I’d think people would want me to follow the law and pay only what the tax code requires." It's also worth noting that Romney could file an amended return later and pay his real, much lower tax rate -- and nobody would ever know. A Tax Rate Lower Than Middle Class Workers Mitt Romney paid a lower tax rate than millions of middle class workers -- the same middle class families whose taxes Romney wants to raise by more than $2,000 a year. Mitt Romney paid a lower percentage of his income in taxes than the millions of working Americans who Romney derided as moochers and lazy victims of government dependency. What We Still Don't Know Any details at all about any individual years before 2010. What is hidden in his earlier returns that is so bad that Romney refuses to release them. Why Romney thinks it's fair to have asked Paul Ryan for ten years of tax returns during the vetting process but refuses to share more than two with the American people. How it's possible for Mitt Romney to have misestimated his 2011 income by a whopping $7 MILLION. Earlier this year, Romney said he made about $20 MILLION last year, but the tax return he released today reported just under $14 MILLION in income. Watch this space next week for more specific questions raised by Romney's tax returns. What Romney Needs To Do Come clean with the American people and release at least as many years of tax returns as he requested from Paul Ryan: 10 full years. BOTTOM LINE: What really should disqualify Romney is the fact that he wants everyone else to pay more so he and other millionaires -- including the donors fueling his campaign -- can continue to pay less</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348269105203</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 19:11:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348269155420-39</Id><Topic><Title>Obama, the truth teller.</Title><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1348251111811</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:11:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, I want someone in office that has a clue so the American people lives will improve.

The number is being released instead of the tax returns themselves, and is being used to rebuff Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's charge that Romney didn't pay taxes over a 10-year period. But it is a meaningless figure. According to the letter from PwC avowing the number, it is based on Romney's adjusted gross income. That means that, for instance, if Romney made investment profit of $20 million, but had losses of, say, $19.9 million, his adjusted gross income would only be $100,000. Paying 20.2 percent of $100,000 would cost Romney just over $20,000. If Reid's comment is interpreted strictly -- that Romney paid literally $0 in taxes over 10 years -- then the PwC letter undermines that charge. But if Romney paid only a very small amount -- say, $20,000 on $20 million -- it would be hard to award Reid many pinocchios for calling that nothing. Such a low-payment scenario is considered quite plausible by tax experts, who noted that investors can pick which investments to realize each year to maximize their tax benefit. In a year such as 2008, when the global markets tanked, an investor would likely have more than enough losses to offset gains. Indeed, Romney's 2010 tax returns show a carryover capital loss credit, meaning he had more losses than he could use the year before. In other words, without seeing Romney's actual return -- or at least without knowing what Romney declared as his adjusted gross income -- it's impossible to know if the rate he paid bears any relation to Romney's economic reality. "His poor father must be so embarrassed about his son," Reid (D-Nev.) told HuffPost earlier this summer, in reference to George Romney's standard-setting decision to turn over 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in the late 1960s. Reid said a Bain investor had told him that Romney paid no taxes over a decade "Harry, he didn't pay any taxes for 10 years," Reid recounted the person as saying. "He didn't pay taxes for 10 years! Now, do I know that that's true? Well, I'm not certain," said Reid. "But obviously he can't release those tax returns. How would it look?" Romney's claimed rate is misleading in another way. Boston College tax law professor Brian Galle noted that Romney's IRA has grown since 1999 at a rate of roughly $9 million to $10 million per year. Yet he pays no taxes on those gains. Adding $10 million to his 2011 income of $13.8 million, for instance, nearly doubles it, meaning his tax rate is roughly half of what his real gain was. "Mitt Romney was paid an immense amount for services rendered and is not putting it in his income. ...To say he has a 14 percent rate doesn't capture the economic reality of what's happening," Galle said. "It's more like Romney has a salary of $10 million and he's paying 14 percent on $1 million and the rest just isn't included." The Washington Post's Greg Sargent identifies a third reason the average of 20.2 percent is meaningless. As the campaign told Sargent, it's an average of rates, rather than the simpler and more accurate calculation, which would divide his total earnings by his total taxes paid. If Romney paid his lowest rates in a number of the higher income years, the overall 20 percent figure would overstate the rate he actually paid over the whole period. Williams provided the following purely hypothetical example: “Let’s say you have 10 years in which you paid 13 percent in taxes, and 10 years in which you paid 27 percent,” Williams told me. “If you average those rates, you’ll get an overall rate of 20 percent. But if the 13 percent years were high income years, and the 27 percent years were low income years, then his total taxes paid as a share of total income over the 20 years would be less, perhaps significantly less, than 20 percent.” Yet in that scenario, the Romney campaign would be claiming, by its chosen metric, to have paid 20 percent. Reid has been quick to dismiss the PwC letter, calling for Romney to release the full returns and saying in a conference call with Nevada reporters that an "outline by some accountant about his blind trust, that’s not going to do it."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1348269670691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 19:21:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348269712739-41</Id><Topic><Title>Obama, the truth teller.</Title><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1348251111811</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 14:11:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bidder, you old fool, you are one of the 47%.

At the same time, the campaign gave out about $200,000 in bonuses to senior employees just after the Republican National Convention, which ended with the candidate not getting much of a bounce in the polls. What timing, eh? Maybe we should call it the Eastwood bonus. In all, nine staffers took home the cash, but as you can see at the top of this post, even as his campaign flushes money down the toilet with primary bonuses in August, Romney's campaign website is still pleading for money, in chunks as little as $15 a donation. But who can blame him for asking for cash? After all, he's got staff bonuses to pay.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1348273090162</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 20:18:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348273730762-49</Id><Title>Elders boo Lyin' Ryan</Title><Msg>Fri Sep 21, 2012 at 02:00 PM PDT Paul Ryan tanks at the AARP by Joan McCarter It started bad for Paul Ryan at the AARP Life @ 50+ event, and never got better.

They've lost their most reliable demographic—old people.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1348273730762</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 20:28:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348274995609-50</Id><Topic><Title>I'd be embarassed to be a Pub</Title><Username>shineola_98</Username><Timestamp>1348262227173</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 17:17:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I pay plenty of federal income taxes, give money and my time to charity and I have plenty left over to waste on etrade.

The bill would bar the Environmental Protection Agency from restricting greenhouse gases, quash stricter fuel efficiency standards for cars and give states control over disposal of harmful coal byproducts. The "Stop the War on Coal Act," passed on a mainly party-line vote, is a companion to GOP campaign ads accusing Obama and Democrats of costing the U.S. hundreds of thousands of jobs while driving up energy prices. Democrats dismissed the legislation as political theatrics, pointing out that almost all the provisions had already passed in the House. Nineteen Democrats — mostly from coal-producing and conservative-leaning states — broke ranks to join Republicans in the 233-175 vote. The legislation is dead on arrival in the Democratic-led Senate, and Obama has already threatened a veto should it ever reach his desk. Republicans and conservative groups are working to saddle down-ballot Democrats with Obama's environmental policies, which are unpopular in energy-producing battleground states such as Virginia and Ohio. They argue that no source of jobs or affordable energy can be spared amid a still-weak economy, with unemployment at 8.1 percent, and reliance on oil from the tumultuous Middle East.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1348276232929</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 21:10:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348277175163-52</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC may fall under $8 again within a month!

Didn't he say in 2008 that increasing country's debt is unpatriotic? Doofus can't even remember country’s debt! Shall I even go on?

"The Romneys’ generous charitable donations in 2011 would have significantly reduced their tax obligation for the year. The Romneys thus limited their deduction of charitable contributions to conform to the Governor's statement in August, based upon the January estimate of income, that he paid at least 13% in income taxes in each of the last 10 years," his trustee Brad Malt said in a note accompanying the return. The choice to not take the deduction allowed Romney to inflate his tax rate to 14.1 percent. The difference between his charitable giving of more than $4 million and his claimed deductions of $2.25 million increased his tax bill by several hundred thousand dollars, as he paid taxes he didn't have to on nearly two million dollars. Luckily for Romney, after the election he can recoup that money. If the American people reject him at the polls in November -- and even if they don't -- Romney would be fully within his legal rights to file an amended return, requiring the Treasury to cut him a substantial check. "It's noble," said Boston College tax law professor Brian Galle of Romney's generous, if temporary, gift to the Treasury. "It also doesn't prevent him from taking that deduction in an amended return if he were to file it after the election." Romney has asserted that he does not believe in paying more taxes than required. "I don't pay more than are legally due and frankly if I had paid more than are legally due I don't think I'd be qualified to become president," Romney has previously said. "I'd think people would want me to follow the law and pay only what the tax code requires."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1348278773531</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 21:52:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348280687755-58</Id><Topic><Title>ETFC Question</Title><Username>cohsgrad</Username><Timestamp>1348243141954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:59:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you for the responses.
