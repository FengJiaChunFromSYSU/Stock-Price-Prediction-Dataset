(AP) — An Illinois Republican official resigned from his leadership post Thursday amid outrage over an email in which he berated a biracial former Miss America as a "street walker" who could fill a law firm's "minority quota" if she loses her bid for Congress. The controversy, involving a county GOP leader in central Illinois who campaigned for U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis, created a new rift for Republicans already struggling to expand and attract women and minority voters. Davis demanded the resignation of the county official, Jim Allen, after learning of what he called a "wrong, appalling and incredibly demeaning" email targeting Erika Harold, Davis' opponent in the March 2014 Republican primary. Sent to Republican blogger Doug Ibendahl, the email referred to Harold as a "street walker" and "love child" of Democrats and suggested the Harvard graduate could fill a "minority quota" at a law firm should she lose the race.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1371817427966</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 08:23:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371818613364-8</Id><Title>gold the one "true money"..... as ususal conservative types are wrong... sea shells are the one true money</Title><Msg>And all investors who finally bought into the gold mania over the past couple of years are now underwater. gold down 30% over last 2 years ......."..coffee up 90%,"................................

Now, the spy agency finds the shoe is on the other foot. A defendant in a Florida murder trial says telephone records collected by the NSA as part of its surveillance programs hold evidence that would help prove his innocence, and his lawyer has demanded that prosecutors produce those records. On Wednesday, the federal government filed a motion saying it would refuse, citing national security. But experts say the novel legal argument could encourage other lawyers to fight for access to the newly disclosed NSA surveillance database. "What's good for the goose is good for the gander, I guess," said George Washington University privacy law expert Dan Solove.

Corrections Corporation of America, the largest and most powerful private prison company in the nation, lost four prison contracts in the past month after extensive reports of abuse, neglect, and even fraud within their operations. Idaho cut ties with the corporation on Wednesday, which turned the state’s largest prison into a violent hellhole inmates called “Gladiator School.” Earlier this year, CCA was caught understaffing the prison and using prison gangs to control the population. The company admitted to falsifying nearly 4,800 hours of staffing records to squeeze more money out of the state for nonexistent security work. Shift logs at the prison showed the same security guards working for 2 to 3 days at a time without breaks. Last week, Texas closed two CCA prisons, including one with a history of suspicious prisoner deaths. One lawsuit alleges prison staff ignored an inmate’s cries for medical assistance, forcing her to give birth in a prison toilet to a baby that died four days later. CCA was also booted from Mississippi earlier this month after multiple deadly riots over poor food and sanitation, lack of medical care, and mistreatment by guards. Mississippi is hiring another private prison company, MTC, to take over CCA’s contract — even though MTC runs another prison with the highest inmate assault rate in the state. Mississippi already terminated contracts with the other major private prison company, GEO Group, after it was found guilty of turning a juvenile facility into “a cesspool of unconstitutional and inhuman acts.” Despite this record, the state is apparently not ready to give up on private prisons.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1371841025748</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 14:57:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371841845429-24</Id><Topic><Title>Obamacare- news just keeps getting better!!</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1371755933104</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 15:18:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can spin this to the cows come home, I am not buying your argument.

IF the accumulation is institutional then I expect them to keep buying into earnings at least until they've gradually accumulated their desired position. If this is primarily retail driven then I have NO idea what could happen. Retail investors have a habit of trading with their emotions rather than with logic, and my inability to anticipate their reactions is one of the primary causes of most of the losses I incur trading. That's one reason I started staying with companies that I could hold and trade long term, but I haven't gotten the knack of predicting short term movements even now, and so I continue. For those that DO have that knack, well, if they also have the knack of finding hidden value (my speciality) then they're gonna get stinking rich.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1371851357971</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 17:49:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371851653351-37</Id><Topic><Title>I guess with the June $12 options expiring today we are stuck here.</Title><Username>pokerpro8222</Username><Timestamp>1371840766005</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-21 14:52:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We did very well considering max pain combined with a price already hovering near it. I'm happy to see us break and sustain $12+ going into earnings. Further the rather gradual rise in the price is also encouraging as its shown little signs of weakness on testing. Decent volumes, potentially higher interest rates, declining default rates, increasing real estate prices for the properties they've had to foreclose on.
