Not to benefit farmers. "Direct payment subsidies are provided without regard to the economic need of the recipients or the financial condition of the farm economy." Farmers basically must take subsidies if they want to sell their products. In other words, subsidies are pushed down their throats. Without subsidy program all farmers will need to raise the price for their end product. Profit for farmers wouldn't be affected as a result, but consumer will suffer. Especially the poor. I would pay a higher price for farm products just to take this idiotic argument from you. But than the poor may not afford his daily food.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1369638527354</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 03:08:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369659575494-3</Id><Topic><Title>scandalous tea party conressman who feeds in the public trough</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369614491860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 20:28:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>in other words you are a hypocrite who does support "for Washington to steal from those in the country and give to others in the country." .... as long as YOU benefit..........

" While Fincher cites chapter and verse to prove that it is immoral for out of work folks to mooch off government largesse, he fails to mention that his own fingers have been observed in the public till. But not for the sake of a measly loaf of bread or carton of milk, mind you. No, the good congressman is one of Tennessee's largest-ever recipients of farm subsidy payments-- otherwise known as "Big Ag's Food Stamp program." How much exactly has the Tennessee legislator received from hard working American taxpayers? Together with his father and brother, who farm over 2500 acres for cotton in five counties, roughly 8.9 million dollars in cotton subsidies over the last 10 years, according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal. Rep. Fincher, who is the second largest recipient of farm subsidies in the United States Congress-- and that is saying a lot-- wants to increase federal crop insurance by a whopping 9 billion dollars over the next 10 years. The congressman has not said how much more he would personally reap if these additional federal subsidies are enacted. The Commercial Appeal reported that in 2010 the Federal Election Commission conducted an investigation into a $250,000 loan to the Fincher campaign from the Gates Banking and Trust Company, where Fincher's father is a board member. On July 21, 2011, the FEC ruled unanimously that Fincher had violated federal election law by listing the loan as a personal donation rather than from Gates Banking and Trust Company. To date, no penalty has been invoked for the illegal act. In September 2011, Fincher was named one of the "Most Corrupt Members of Congress" by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, specificall</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369659575494</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 08:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369661554634-4</Id><Topic><Title>OMG- Obamcare is a TRIUMPH!!!!</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369583096449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-26 11:44:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yep, add this to the huge list of things the gop has been wrong about.

The Obama administration has called for cuts to all of the farm subsidies including the crop insurance program. " Farm Subsidy Recipient Backs Food Stamp Cuts By RON NIXON Published: May 22, 2013 WASHINGTON — A Tennessee congressman who supports billions of dollars in cuts to the food stamp program is one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsides, according to new annual data released by a Washington environmental group. Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, said that Mr. Fincher was being hypocritical. “Not only is he advocating deep cuts to other people’s money while he is getting subsidies, he also voted to increase the subsidies that he benefits from,” Mr. Faber said. ...</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369679087617</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-27 14:24:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369679263495-16</Id><Title>Obamacare set to offer reasonable premium prices......(pubs proven wrong again)</Title><Msg>ACA health exchanges offer REASONABLE premiums, CONTRARY to loser pubbie blather . “On average, the most affordable “silver plan” – which covers 70 percent of the average subscriber’s medical costs – comes with a $276 monthly premium. For the 2.6 million Californians who will receive federal subsidies, the price is a good deal less expensive…” “The premiums and participation in California, Oregon, Washington and other states show that insurers want to compete for the new enrollees in this market,” Gary Claxton, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said via e-mail. “The premiums have not skyrocketed and the insurers that serve this market now are continuing. The rates look like what we would expect for decent coverage offered to a standard population.” Cohn is saying that, despite the political naysayers, the healthcare exchange concept appears to be working very well indeed in states like California, Oregon and Washington—the first states to publish the expected health exchange prices for purchasing coverage. These are also states that are actually committed to seeing the program work as opposed to those states whose leaders have a vested political interest in seeing the Affordable Care Act fail. Keep in mind that the entire idea of the exchanges is to require health insurance companies to compete openly with one another by offering identical coverage programs in the three created classes—each offering insurance coverage that actually delivers meaningful protection to customers—and then openly disclosing the price each insurance company will charge for that policy.
