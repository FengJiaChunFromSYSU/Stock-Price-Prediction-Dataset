When we shut down the Department of Education and off the federal bureaucrats, we can get rid of 90% of the bureaucrats at the state level who exist to shovel paperwork back and forth with the feds.</Msg><Username>amorano_123</Username><Timestamp>1355494973410</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 09:22:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355496909377-2</Id><Topic><Title>The federal government screws up education</Title><Username>amorano_123</Username><Timestamp>1355494973410</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 09:22:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is more than that, friend. At the district level, there are employees who exist to satisfy the state and federal bureaucrats. At every level, there are more who exist to hire and house and care for them.

That is right, READING. The percentage of public school teachers who are proficient in reading is unknown, but probably higher. And that comes at a price to the taxpayers of $40,000 per child per year. Had to correct myself. I almost called them students.</Msg><Username>caribou_barbre</Username><Timestamp>1355498308719</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 10:18:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355517147859-4</Id><Title>Eric Schmidt declines Obama cabinet post.</Title><Msg>Good for him? But wait! Obamaâ€™s Google Supporters Moved 80% of Pre-Tax Profits into Bermuda Shell Company. Obama invites to his cabinet tax dodgers? What else is new? Tax cheat Timmy is already there for almost 4 years. Mitt is tax dodger, but those in Google are just obedient existing law followers. Works well for "highly educated" Obama voters. Oh yeah, bring more of those who don't know where and how to obtain ID cards to voting booths. That will do it! Good grief. This country is sinking lower and lower day by day.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1355517147859</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 15:32:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355518469577-5</Id><Topic><Title>Eric Schmidt declines Obama cabinet post.</Title><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1355517147859</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 15:32:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Patently wrong. But what difference does it make, genius? Obama brought him in, Obama keeps him for full term. Obama invites yet another "cheat" into his cabinet. That's perfectly acceptable.
