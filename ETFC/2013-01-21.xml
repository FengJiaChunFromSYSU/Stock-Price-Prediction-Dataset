Time will tell which is the worst investment. **First Term: Obama Increased Debt $50,521 Per Household; More Than First 42 Presidents in 53 Terms Combined** During Barack Obama’s first term as president of the United States, the debt of the federal government increased by $5.8 trillion, which exceeds the combined debt accumulated under all presidents from George Washington through Bill Clinton. The new federal debt accumulated in Obama's first term equaled approximately $50,521 for each of household in the country. On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama was first inaugurated, the total debt of the federal government was $10,626,877,048,913.08, according to the U.S. Treasury. As of the close of business on Jan. 17, the last day reported by the Treasury before Obama’s second inauguration, the total debt of the federal government was $16,432,631,489,854.70. Thus, from Obama’s first inauguration to his second, the federal government’s debt grew by $5,805,754,440,941.62. Given that the Census Bureau currently estimates that there are 114,916,000 households in the United States, the $5,805,754,440,941.62 debt increase under Obama equals about $50,521 per household.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358800144179</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 15:29:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358802367391-8</Id><Topic><Title>So, a real estate scammer, a liar and a bully all walk into a bar -- the bartender says</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1358734147915</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-20 21:09:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>in their "work" shoes LMAO!</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1358802367391</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 16:06:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358809543929-9</Id><Topic><Title>Got $50,521.00</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358800144179</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 15:29:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Given the fact that our reelected president considers debt/deficit problem solved by raising tax on those who don't need money, we can say with high probability that this mid term number will be pretty much doubled. Doesn't scare anyone? That's from the same man who $8T ago as Senator from Illinois was screaming that raisng debt ceiling by 2007 Congress is failure of leadership. And just 4 years ago raising debt to $9.5T was unpatriotic. All this looks to me like a bad, bad dream. Will people ever realize this is not going to last long?</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1358809543929</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 18:05:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358822263559-10</Id><Title>My friends and I are uneducated liberal hicks</Title><Msg>But we do not sit and stuff our faces with our elbow on the table!
