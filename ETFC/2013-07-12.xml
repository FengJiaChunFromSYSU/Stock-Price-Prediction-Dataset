Confirmation of this story also explains the sudden shift in position of Virginia's Republican Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. Last week, Ken Cuccinelli claimed he was unaware of the investigation of Bob McDonnell. This past Monday he claimed the investigation was "not related to me." Today, Wednesday July 10, 2013, Ken Cuccinelli attempted to take credit for the investigation.* According to NBC News' The question now becomes whether McDonnell's fall from grace hurts gubernatorial nominee Ken Cuccinelli, who Democrats point out also has close ties to Jonnie Williams (including accepting gifts from him). The Cuccinelli campaign responds that Cucinelli’s AG office initiated this investigation, and they don’t believe McAuliffe will be a credible messenger to attack them on this issue. But it’s hard to see how this doesn’t hurt Cuccinelli, because he needs to court moderates and the GOP business community, and right now McDonnell looks to be toxic to help him with those groups. Meanwhile, the Cuccinelli campaign is hitting Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe for campaigning today with Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley. “Gov. O’Malley signed the largest tax increase in Maryland history and earned a ‘D’ rating for supporting increased spending and higher taxes. He supports the war on coal, Obamacare, and even forced non-union teachers to pay union fees,” the Cuccinelli campaign says in a release."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1373639769278</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 10:36:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373639865938-9</Id><Topic><Title>BO the conqueror</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1373404472689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 17:14:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Can't help but notice how many on this board have given this good news a thumbs down.

Coming to the same conclusion as it did in December, the all-male court found that bosses can fire employees they see as threats to their marriages, even if the subordinates have not engaged in flirtatious or other inappropriate behavior. The court said such firings do not count as illegal sex discrimination because they are motivated by feelings, not gender. The ruling upholds a judge’s decision to dismiss a discrimination lawsuit filed against Fort Dodge dentist James Knight, who fired assistant Melissa Nelson, even while acknowledging she had been a stellar employee for 10 years. Knight and his wife believed that his attraction to Nelson — two decades younger than the dentist — had become a threat to their marriage. Nelson, now 33, was replaced by another woman; Knight had an all-female staff. The all-male court issued its revised opinion Friday in the case after taking the unusual step last month of withdrawing its December opinion, which had received nationwide publicity, debate and criticism. Nelson’s attorney, Paige Fiedler, had asked the court in January to reconsider, calling the decision a blow for gender and racial equity in the workplace. She had warned the opinion could allow bosses to legally fire dark-skinned blacks and replace them with light-skinned blacks or small-breasted workers in favor of big-breasted workers. The court had only granted reconsiderations five times in the last decade.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1373654538043</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 14:42:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373655178779-15</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on women</Title><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1373643134366</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 11:32:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>kenny assaults shorts and longs alike</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1373655178779</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 14:52:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373656876567-16</Id><Topic><Title>BO the conqueror</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1373404472689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-09 17:14:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your post has to be one of the most gobbledygook in the history of man kind.

But this morning, as The Hill reports, the House added insult to injury by passing a GOP amendment to the bill that blocks enforcement of new light bulb standards. Those standards were first enacted in 2007 under the Bush Administration by the Energy Independence and Security Act — though Congress has delayed implementation of the standards sense. Many commentators characterized the standards as a “ban” on incandescent light bulbs, but technically they weren’t. They were merely new efficiency requirements that apply to the manufacture of all light bulbs, and incandescent light bulbs are inefficient energy users, making the new standards a nearly impossible technological hurdle for them to clear. Of course, that’s how efficiency standards are supposed to work. Take the inefficiency of any given incandescent, multiply it by all then incandescents used across the nation, and that translates into a lot of wasted energy. That, in turn, means unnecessary energy costs for consumers and unnecessary carbon emissions, adding to the growing global threat posed by climate change. And as Times’ Michael Grunwald pointed out, even without the standards in place, alternative LED bulbs are becoming more advanced and dropping rapidly in cost, while a new super-efficient incandescent bulb that uses nanotechnology was just released as well. The standards would merely serve to speed this process even further."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1373667451222</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 18:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373667560205-24</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on efficiency</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1373667451222</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 18:17:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It’s how markets are supposed to work: present them a challenge, and they adapt. None of that moved Rep. Michael Burgess (R-TX), however. Last year he proposed language prohibiting any Energy Department funds from being used to implement the standards. He re-proposed that language this year, and today the House approved an amendment affixing it to the energy and water bill. “If the new energy-efficient light bulbs save money, and if they’re better for the environment, we should trust our constituents to make the choice on their own move toward these bulbs,” Burgess said while justifying his proposal. “Let the market decide.” But the way markets work is through price signals — that’s how we sort out the value we place on the environment, versus the value we place on convenience, versus the value we place on energy, etc. And an appropriate signal for carbon emissions is precisely what we don’t have. Carbon emissions threaten future damage to lives and the economy through the droughts, heat waves, and extreme weather brought on by climate change. Right now we don’t pay for that damage when we use the types of energy that release carbon dioxide. Because of that failure, the U.S. actually subsidizers fossil fuel use far more than any other country in the world. So for Burgess to suggest blocking the standards leaves it to “the market to decide” is nonsensical. Without price signals, the market can’t decide. A cap-and-trade system or a carbon tax would address this problem directly. But in their absence, efficiency standards are a decent substitute. (And even in their presence, efficiency standards are a useful compliment.) If Burgess doesn’t like the standards, and would prefer a more “market-based” solution to the problem of carbon emissions, he should put his money where his mouth is and propose one."
