The RNC has kept the document tightly held, refusing to share earlier drafts with reporters. An apparent staff error led to its posting. (Also on POLITICO: GOP platform: lose weight to cut health costs) A platform committee of 112 members met here Monday and Tuesday to edit the document. They plan to release the full document publicly as the convention kicks off at the start of next week. At that point, the full convention is expected to approve it by voice vote. The RNC would not confirm that what was posted Friday is the final platform language, but it matches amendments approved earlier this week by the platform committee. The preamble is identical to what was read by Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell at an open-press sessionTuesday night. “The final 2012 Republican platform will be made public after the full RNC convention votes on Monday,” RNC spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski said in an email.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345867357000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 00:02:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345867736000-2</Id><Title>Ryan "misspeaks" ugly!!</Title><Msg>Ryan on abortion exceptions: Rape is just another ‘method of conception’ By David Edwards Friday, August 24, 2012 13:02 EDT Paul Ryan speaks to WJHL Topics: Todd Akin ♦ Vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan Vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan says that he personally believes that rape is just another “method of conception” and not an excuse to allow abortions. During an interview with WJHL this week, Ryan was asked his view about Rep. Todd Akin, who recently asserted that women could not get pregnant from “legitimate rape.” “Specifically where you stand when it comes to rape, and when it comes to the issue of should it be legal for a woman to be able to get an abortion if she’s raped?” WJHL reporter Josh Smith wondered. “I’m very proud of my pro-life record, and I’ve always adopted the idea that, the position that the method of conception doesn’t change the definition of life,” Ryan explained. “But let’s remember, I’m joining the Romney-Ryan ticket. And the president makes policy.” “And the president, in this case the future President Mitt Romney, has exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother, which is a vast improvement of where we are right now.” MSNBC’s Steve Benen noted that responses like this were probably the reason that Romney is refusing to take any questions about Akin or abortion. “In this case, when Ryan says ‘the method of conception’ is irrelevant, he’s talking about rape,” Benen wrote. “In other words, the Republicans’ vice presidential nominee clearly believes the government should force women to take their pregnancy to term if they are impregnated by a rapist.” “Republicans can only distance themselves so much from Todd Akin before we realize they share his views.”</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345867736000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 00:08:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345868935000-3</Id><Title>Wisdom of the ages</Title><Msg>Should any political party attempt to abolish social, security, unemployment insurance, and eliminate labor law and farm programs, you would not hear of that party again in our political history.

Current seniors would also have to pay more for preventive, hospital, and physician services should Romney and Ryan repeal the Affordable Care Act, facing an increase in health spending of between $7,900 and $18,600 over the course of their retirement. Beginning in 2023, Romney’s proposal — which is modeled heavily on Paul Ryan’s FY 2013 budget — would provide all retirees with a premium support subsidy to buy coverage from an exchange of private insurance plans or traditional Medicare. Private insurance plans in each geographical area would bid for how much they would charge to provide Medicare benefits and the premium subsidy would be tied to the premium of the plan with the second-lowest cost, or the premium for traditional Medicare—whichever is lower. If seniors choose a plan that costs more than the voucher, they will have to pay the difference. As a result, most seniors will have to spend more on coverage. Here are 5 reasons why: 1) Current seniors will pay more. The premium support structure does not kick in until 2023, so current seniors will remain in the existing Medicare program. But should Romney/Ryan repeal the Affordable Care Act’s savings, beneficiaries will face higher cost sharing and premiums (particularly for preventive services) and seniors who have received prescription drug discounts, will now pay more for their medications. What’s more, Romney/Ryan would lower Medicaid spending significantly beginning next year, shifting federal spending to states and beneficiaries, and increasing costs for the 9 million Medicare recipients who are dependent on Medicaid.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345908998000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 11:36:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345909903000-19</Id><Topic><Title>DNC Convention Opening Nite Dinner Menu</Title><Username>busser_hyman</Username><Timestamp>1345847680000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 18:34:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At the Pub Liars convention, they will be consuming whole roasted orphans.

Secretary of State Jon Husted issued the order Aug. 15. Former Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner, together with the advocacy group Fair Elections Ohio and a voters’ referendum committee, claimed Husted violated their constitutional rights in a complaint filed today in federal court in Columbus. Husted’s action revived portions of a repealed Ohio law, effectively reinstating parts of the statute that curbed or eliminated weekend early voting, the plaintiffs said. They seek a declaratory judgment that the directive and other actions are unconstitutional. Husted set uniform hours for in-person absentee voting after the Ohio Democratic Party said times were being expanded mostly in Republican-leaning counties. Read more: http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-25/ohio-secretary-of-state-sued-over-voting-hours-directive.html Fair Elections Ohio contends that Husted's ruling has been superceded by the petition campaign to overturn HB194.

The attached complaint was filed this morning in Federal District Court in Columbus, Ohio. "With the public controversy on early voting based on the recent action of the Ohio Secretary of State, along with his refusal to submit HB 194 for consideration by the Ohio Ballot Board last week, an untenable situation has been created." The Secretary's weekend bans on voting that were the practical result of HB 194's shorter absentee and in-person voting period that were stopped by the referendum were, in effect, reenacted in the Secretary's recent actions to constrict early in-person voting hours to exclude weekends. (HB 194 would have stopped in person early voting on the weekends of October 6-7 and 13-14 and on Sundays all day and Saturdays after 12:00 noon, as well as the last 3 days before the election). Refusing, as Secretary Husted did to put the issue on the ballot, despite clear state constitutional requirements to do so, is a federal constitutional violation of due process and the first amendment. On the same day, Secretary Husted reinstituted parts of HB 194 by banning weekend voting by directive power that carries the force of state law. We wish to express our thanks again to the hundreds of thousands of citizens throughout the state of Ohio who signed our petitions last year and who have continued to stand with us in our efforts this year to ensure that all attempts to suppress the vote of Ohio citizens are defeated. Today's filing is just one more development in our continuing drive to ensure our voices and those of thousands of Ohioans are heard on the state's voting rules and in voting on and before Election Day."

If you have any regard for the Gospel of Christ, you should care. A false religion should not prosper with the support of Christians. The salvation of souls is at stake. For me, that alone disqualifies him from my vote. Because Mormons believe in continuing revelation, it is possible that in the future the LDS church will renounce its heretical beliefs and come fully into the fold of orthodox Christianity. Many theologians and church historians believe the church is on such a trajectory. But if that happens, it is an event still well in the future. The Mormon Church of today is, by the lights of biblical evangelical Christianity, a false religion. If Mitt Romney believes what the Mormon Church teaches about the world and how it operates, then he is unfit to serve.

What’s more, Romney/Ryan would lower Medicaid spending significantly beginning next year, shifting federal spending to states and beneficiaries, and increasing costs for the 9 million Medicare recipients who are dependent on Medicaid.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345942021347</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 20:47:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345942146202-30</Id><Title>Now we know why yapoop was one of the first and sucks hind tit now</Title><Msg>Morons</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1345942146202</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 20:49:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345942946812-31</Id><Title>OHIO GOP assault on democracy</Title><Msg>Ohio Secretary Of State Sued Over Weekend Voting Curbs Source: Bloomberg Ohio’s Republican secretary of state was sued by his Democratic predecessor over a directive that makes early-voting hours uniform in all 88 of the state’s counties in part by eliminating weekend balloting. Secretary of State Jon Husted issued the order Aug. 15. Former Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner, together with the advocacy group Fair Elections Ohio and a voters’ referendum committee, claimed Husted violated their constitutional rights in a complaint filed today in federal court in Columbus. Husted’s action revived portions of a repealed Ohio law, effectively reinstating parts of the statute that curbed or eliminated weekend early voting, the plaintiffs said. They seek a declaratory judgment that the directive and other actions are unconstitutional. Husted set uniform hours for in-person absentee voting after the Ohio Democratic Party said times were being expanded mostly in Republican-leaning counties.

The attached complaint was filed this morning in Federal District Court in Columbus, Ohio. "With the public controversy on early voting based on the recent action of the Ohio Secretary of State, along with his refusal to submit HB 194 for consideration by the Ohio Ballot Board last week, an untenable situation has been created." The Secretary's weekend bans on voting that were the practical result of HB 194's shorter absentee and in-person voting period that were stopped by the referendum were, in effect, reenacted in the Secretary's recent actions to constrict early in-person voting hours to exclude weekends. (HB 194 would have stopped in person early voting on the weekends of October 6-7 and 13-14 and on Sundays all day and Saturdays after 12:00 noon, as well as the last 3 days before the election). Refusing, as Secretary Husted did to put the issue on the ballot, despite clear state constitutional requirements to do so, is a federal constitutional violation of due process and the first amendment. On the same day, Secretary Husted reinstituted parts of HB 194 by banning weekend voting by directive power that carries the force of state law. We wish to express our thanks again to the hundreds of thousands of citizens throughout the state of Ohio who signed our petitions last year and who have continued to stand with us in our efforts this year to ensure that all attempts to suppress the vote of Ohio citizens are defeated. Today's filing is just one more development in our continuing drive to ensure our voices and those of thousands of Ohioans are heard on the state's voting rules and in voting on and before Election Day."
