Fortunately, President Obama saved the U.S. auto industry and now it’s roaring back. For example, just today we learned that General Motors is adding another 2,000 jobs in Michigan. These jobs are coming to Michigan as part of larger effort to insource thousands of jobs at the world’s largest automaker. And this is just the tip of the iceberg. Here’s a look at the auto rescue — by the numbers. More than 1 million: Jobs saved by the auto rescue. $85 billion: Total spent by the U.S. government on the auto rescue. $60 billion: Amount the government will likely recover. $7.2 billion: Savings to taxpayers from reduced unemployment, Social Security, and other benefits in 2009 and 2010. $97 billion: Estimated losses in personal incomes prevented by the auto rescue. 26 percent: Remaining stake (of the initial 61 percent stake) held in GM by the government. 0: Number of Chrysler shares currently held by the government. 167,000: Number of jobs the automakers and their suppliers are forecasted to add by 2015. 2.5 million: Number of people employed by the U.S. auto industry today, up from 2.3 million in August 2009. 3.3 million: Cars and light trucks sold by GM and Chrysler in the past 12 months, up from 2.9 million in the previous period. Figure 1 BOTTOM LINE: Mitt Romney said to “let Detroit go bankrupt,” but we didn’t do that and now the auto industry is helping to fuel the recovery in states across the country, particularly Michigan and Ohio."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349841670450</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 00:01:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349842052700-2</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot would have destroyed the U.S. auto industry and precipitated a DEPRESSION</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349841670450</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 00:01:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ford would have been dragged down too!!! Ford Would Have Shut Without Auto Bailouts, Rattner Says By Angela Greiling Keane - Oct 9, 2012 7:20 PM PT Ford Motor Co. (F), the only large U.S. automaker that didn’t receive a U.S. government bailout, would’ve failed along with General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC if President Barack Obama’s administration hadn’t rescued the industry, said Steven Rattner, who headed Obama’s auto task force. “Ford would have closed because it wouldn’t have been able to get parts, because the parts industry in this country was in arguably worse shape than the assemblers,” Rattner said today at the Center for American Progress in Washington. Enlarge image Ford Would Have Shut Without GM, Chrysler Aid, Rattner Says Ford Motor Co. Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally last month concurred with Steven Rattner’s view, saying he testified before Congress in support of taxpayer support for his competitors because it also saved Ford. Photographer: Peter Foley/Bloomberg Rattner, now chairman of the Willett Advisors LLC investment firm, led the $63.4 billion bailout in 2009 of GM and Chrysler, which he said would have fired all their workers and ceased to exist without the bailout. The auto bailout has been a point of contention in the presidential race between Obama and Republican Mitt Romney as they compete for votes in swing states including Ohio, home to U.S. automaker and parts-supplier plants. Romney opposed the government bailout. Ford’s View Ford Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally last month made similar comments, saying he doesn’t regret testifying before Congress in support of taxpayer support for his competitors. “We think about that a lot, should we have gone back and testified on behalf of our competitors who were bankrupt,” Mulally told reporters Sept. 18 in New York. “I would do the same thing again today.” Mulally said he agreed with the assessment of “the economic advisers of the Bush administration and the Obama administration that if GM and Chrysler had gone into free fall, they could have taken the United States from a recession into a depression.” The U.S. government was the only entity that could save the domestic automakers because no one, including banks that were dealing with their own financial crises, was willing to put private capital into GM and Chrysler at the beginning of 2009, Rattner said. “If you can’t pay your workers, if you can’t pay your suppliers, if you can’t pay your electric bills, then you have to liquidate,” he said. “This is what government is set up to do.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349842052700</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 00:07:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349875786742-3</Id><Topic><Title>Can we all now agree on who the liars are?</Title><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349836279315</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:31:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Grab your Coke and popcorn and nestle in to watch the administration infighting culminate into its speedy demise.

His campaign two hours later: Governor Romney would of course support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life. So Mitt Romney went from "no legislation ... that would become part of my agenda" to "would of course support legislation" in the span of just two hours. Wow. At least when he was governor it took him two full years to flip-flop on his pro-choice pledge. It really is saying something when you can look at the old Romney and say he was a model of consistency, right? As Bill Clinton said yesterday about this new Romney: "I had a different reaction to that first debate than a lot of people did," Clinton told nearly 2,000 supporters at a campaign rally for Obama and other Democrats. "I thought, 'Wow, here's old moderate Mitt. Where ya been, boy?'" Clinton compared Romney's performance in Denver to a sales job at the Boston private equity firm where the Republican presidential nominee made his personal fortune. "It was like one of these Bain Capital deals, you know, where he's the closer," Clinton said. "So he shows up, doesn't really know much about the deal and says, 'Tell me what I'm supposed to say to close.' The problem with this deal is the deal was made by severe conservative Mitt," alluding to Romney's description of himself in February as having been a "severely conservative" governor in Massachusetts. I'd be lying if I said I knew what Mitt Romney's true beliefs were. Hell, I don't even really know if he actually has any true beliefs other than the belief that he's justified in doing whatever it takes to get what he wants. But what I do know is that it only took his campaign two hours to take back what he said. I do know that earlier in the campaign Mitt Romney wrote an op-ed in the National Review pledging to do "everything in my power" to curtail abortion rights, including supporting several pieces of legislation that he specifically identified. And I do know that when it came to picking a vice presidential candidate, he picked Paul Ryan, one of the most conservative Republicans in congress on issues of choice and reproductive freedom. We may not know what Mitt Romney really believes, but we do know what he's said and done as a candidate and a politician. And we do know that he is that he is a captive of the conservative Republican base. They might cut him a little slack over the next month, but ultimately they're the boss—not the other way around. And the position he'd take as president would be the position that they demand.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349877855392</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 10:04:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349877956130-21</Id><Title>Richard Millhouse Nixon</Title><Msg>What a dude.</Msg><Username>brandish_now</Username><Timestamp>1349877956130</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 10:05:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349878195905-22</Id><Title>Dumbo (LOSING!!!)</Title><Msg>Al the Global Whiners are out in full swing!!

That, of course, comes after Romney's very publicly renouncing his earlier pro-choice position prior to deciding to run for president. It also conflicts with his prior statements that he would seek to appoint justices that would overturn Roe v. Wade. In response to Mitt Romney's latest flip-flop, he flip-flopped right back with Katrina Trinko of the National Review tweeting the following: Katrina Trinko @KatrinaTrinko . @andreamsaul on Romney's abortion comment to DMR: Rom "wld of course support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life" 9 Oct 12 We all knew that Mitt Romney was a serial flip-flopper who it seems changed positions at will, and cleaned his slate like an Etch-a-Sketch, but I think this sets a record even by his standards. In the span of one day he was anti-choice, then pro-choice again and then finally ended the day anti-choice again. Nice going Mitt.

The mailings -- which do not focus on slavery or racial issues -- were distributed as part of an AFP plan to blanket Arkansas on behalf of Republican state legislative candidates as the GOP battles to retake the state legislature for the first time since the Civil War. The two legislators -- state Reps. Jon Hubbard of Jonesboro and Loy Mauch of Bismarck -- have a history of pro-slavery positions, according to recent reporting by the Arkansas Times. Hubbard was revealed to have written that slavery may "have been a blessing" in a 2010 book, while Mauch authored a series of letters to the editor in the last decade that espoused pro-slavery views, writing that former President Abraham Lincoln was a "neurotic Northern war criminal" and comparing Lincoln and Civil War generals to Nazis. The AFP ads sent on behalf of Hubbard and Mauch praise the pair for voting against implementing the Affordable Care Act, along with votes that AFP says are against higher taxes. In one piece sent on behalf of both candidates regarding the ACA, the ad features pictures of a smiling white family and a black doctor, and thanks them for voting against health care exchanges in Arkansas, saying they will cost states between $10 million and $100 million a year. The mailers also feature pictures of Hubbard or Mauch and ask readers to call them to "thank them for protecting our health care freedom." In another mailing, AFP promotes Mauch's signing of a pledge the group had circulated, with signatures signifying a promise to not raise taxes. The mailer claimed that pledge is helping Arkansas. Teresa Oelke, AFP's director in Arkansas, said that the group was not supporting individual candidates but was pushing various issues in the state and urging residents to contact legislators to shape policy in these areas. She described the mailers as part of the "issue education" efforts that AFP ended in the state in September. Oelke, who is leading a statewide bus tour for AFP, also said the group does not support what Hubbard and Mauch wrote regarding slavery. She declined to say if the group would be sending out more mail on their behalf, saying "we don't discuss internal strategy and never have." "AFP believes it is absolutely unacceptable for any public official to espouse racist views," Oelke said. "Everyone should have an equal opportunity to pursue prosperity, regardless of race or ethnicity." The Washington Post reported earlier this month that AFP is set to spend a million dollars to assist Republican candidates in the Arkansas legislative races, as one of several Republican groups involved in the state's contests. On the Democratic side, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is invested in the state. AFP played a major role in August's Republican primary in Kansas, where conservatives ousted moderate Republican state senators in an effort to flip the Kansas Senate from moderate GOP to conservative control. Kansas Senate President Steve Morris (R-Hugoton) blamed AFP for his primary defeat and accused them and other groups of wanting to turn the state into an "ultraconservative utopia." Former state Rep. Charlie Fuqua, who is seeking a comeback, wrote in a 2012 book that he wanted to deport all Muslims and wanted to institute the death penalty for rebellious children. He wrote that liberals and Christians are the "anti-Christ." Even the Arkansas Republican Party has said it will not provide any more assistance to the three candidates, while U.S. Reps. Tim Griffin and Steve Womack and Benton County Republican and state Rep. Prissy Hickerson (R-Texarkana) -- who have made donations to either Hubbard or Mauch -- have distanced themselves from the comments. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe (D), who has condemned AFP ads in the state, called the candidates' writings "sad." Mauch has not commented publicly on the issue, while Fuqua has said he is not commenting. Mauch, Hubbard and Fuqua could not be immediately reached for comment on the AFP mailings. Mauch and Hubbard have not returned repeated calls from The Huffington Post for comment on the controversy surrounding their writings, and Fuqua, when reached recently, hung up."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349883767887</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 11:42:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349884504285-30</Id><Title>GOP assault on women and the poor</Title><Msg>Cristina Page Romney's War on Contraception Posted: 10/10/2012 2:00 am Let's start with a fact: Ninety-nine percent of American women who've had sex have used contraception. This particular fact is arguably the cornerstone -- or a cornerstone -- on which an important part of our private lives are built -- at least for those of us who have sex and want to plan decisions like when we have a family. And this brings us to a second fact. This election year is the first in which American's access to contraception will be dramatically increased or dramatically scaled back depending on who wins the Oval Office. With contraceptive policy, decision-making power is not equally distributed among the branches of government. Almost all decisions can be taken by one federal official: the president. And so, with less than a month to the election, it's important to understand how immediate and encompassing the changes could be. Mitt Romney and Barack Obama have very different views of whether people should have access to contraception If elected president, Mitt Romney has announced his plan to do three things as it relates to contraception. They are: 1. Romney plans to end Title X, the nation's contraception program for low-income Americans that serves 5 million people per year and is estimated to prevent one million unintended pregnancies each year too. (it also saves taxpayers $3.4 billion in costs annually that otherwise would have been borne by Medicaid for prenatal care, delivery and infant care.) Title X currently supports six in ten of all family planning health centers in the United States. Romney plans to eliminate the program and with it coverage of contraception to more than 4 million people. 2. Romney will, as he put it, "Get rid" of Planned Parenthood. Not an empty threat or a misleading one. Last year, the Republicans came within a hair of shutting the federal government down because they wanted to strip Planned Parenthood of its federal funding. President Obama held firm, winning the game of chicken. But Romney won't be a defender of what is the largest provider of contraception in the country. If Planned Parenthood takes that massive hit, losing the $487 million of the federal funding it receives from Medicaid for contraceptive services and other federal grants for STI treatment, prevention and cancer screenings, it will be cut at the knees. The defunding would eliminate access to care at Planned Parenthood for half of it's patients, 1.5 million people a year. 3. Romney will remove contraceptive coverage from Obamacare. Even if Romney doesn't succeed in reversing Obamacare, which he promises he will, he would still eliminate contraception. The Secretary of HHS who is appointed by the President can simply highlight the word contraception and press delete. Millions of Americans will be stripped of contraceptive access in these three acts promised by Romney. The average American woman spends 30 years of her life trying to prevent pregnancy and only three years trying to get pregnant or actually being pregnant. Men have a lot at stake on this issue too, arguably more, since the average male spends close to 40 years trying to prevent pregnancy. The comments section of this post will no doubt be filled by those asking, "Why should we pay for you to have sex?" This is the wrong question. Family planning is one of the most widely relied on preventive health services used by Americans. Access to contraception reduces unintended pregnancy, resulting in future pregnancies that are healthier, healthier mothers and healthier babies. All these outcomes save money too. Restricting access to contraception leads to a dramatic increase in unintended pregnancy as well as surges in maternal death. There's one other guarantee with the Romney plan: more abortions. Like most Republican pro-lifers, Romney says he finds abortion unconscionable, but won't support the most obvious means to reduce their number. Family planning is the foundation on which many Americans structure their lives -- especially in tough times. In fact, when the economy suffers, family planning providers report a surge in patients getting long-term contraceptive methods, like IUDs and vasectomies. Supporting one's family is not only an American value, it's a biological instinct. The right wing has tried to shame those who use contraception at all - think of Rush Limbaugh calling Sandra Fluke a #$%$ for merely saying contraception should be available to women in college. But for most Americans contraception is a way to behave responsibly. The war on contraception is escalating and will continue beyond the election too, and anything that can bring attention to the cause is worthwhile. President Obama has done it, Planned Parenthood has done it, and even I, in a modest way, have tried to draw attention to this political conflict by creating a 2013 calendar featuring photographs of leaders in the war on contraception, the people who are defending American's ability to plan their families and enjoy healthy sex lives free from unwanted, life-altering and avoidable consequences, as it should be. If you agree, please consider supporting this campaign and spreading the word."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349884504285</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 11:55:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349885656546-31</Id><Title>Pro-Life Tee Potty Pub Pressured Mistress to Abort</Title><Msg>Love they hypocrisy of the right WASHINGTON -- A pro-life, family-values congressman who worked as a doctor before winning election as a Tea Party-backed Republican had an affair with a patient and later pressured her to get an abortion.

"Governor Romney was inspired by the memory of meeting Glen Doherty and shared his story and that memory. We respect the wishes of Mrs. Doherty though," campaign aide Kevin Madden told BuzzFeed. On Tuesday, Romney spoke to supporters in Iowa, recalling a chance encounter with a former Navy SEAL while mistakenly attending a Christmas party in San Diego a few years ago. “I met some remarkable people, one of whom was a former Navy SEAL," Romney said. "I just learned a few days ago that he was one of the two former Navy SEALs killed in Benghazi. It broke my heart.” Romney didn't directly provide Doherty's name, but his campaign later confirmed his identity. He was one of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, killed during a violent assault on the consulate in Benghazi last month. Boston's WHDH later reached out to Doherty's mother, Barbara, to get her reaction to Romney's campaign trail anecdote. "I don't trust Romney. He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda," she told WHDH. "It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama.” Doherty similarly decried the politicization of her son's death in an interview with the Boston Herald last month. Glen Doherty's friend, Elf Ellefsen, also spoke with Seattle's KIRO, expressing similar disagreement with Romney's mention of his friend's death. According to Ellefsen, Doherty found his exchange with Romney to be "insincere and stale." "Mitt Romney approached him ultimately four times, using this private gathering as a political venture to further his image," Ellefsen told KIRO. "He kept introducing himself as Mitt Romney, a political figure. The same introduction, the same opening line ... [Doherty] said it was pathetic and comical to have the same person come up to you within only a half hour, have this person reintroduce himself to you, having absolutely no idea whatsoever that he just did this 20 minutes ago, and did not even recognize Glen's face." Romney had again made mention of his meeting with Doherty in the wake of these reports on Wednesday during a town hall event in Ohio."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349895303951</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 14:55:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349895756438-39</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot defames the memory of dead Navy Seal</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349895303951</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 14:55:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Romney's emotional story remembered very differently by friend of fallen SEAL" "On the stump in Iowa Tuesday, Mitt Romney revealed that he met former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty at a holiday party some years ago. Doherty is one of four Americans killed during the September 11th attack on the American consulate in Benghazi. Romney's story started out lighthearted, as he recounted how he and Ann mistook a holiday gathering across the street for their neighborhood party, and he ended up talking to Doherty. "He skied in some of the places I had. We had a lot of things in common," Romney said of Doherty. Both men are from Massachusetts. "He told me that he keeps going back to the Middle East. He cares very deeply about the people there. He served in the military there, went back from time to time to offer security services and so forth to people there. You can imagine how I felt when I found out that he was one of the two former Navy SEALS killed in Benghazi on September 11th."Romney was visibly emotional during the story, and the video of the speech was repeated throughout the day on network and cable news. But one of Glen Doherty's best friends remembered Doherty's impression of this meeting much differently. Elf Ellefsen met Glen Doherty skiing in Utah when he was 19, and the two men remained friends for more than 20 years. "A guy living life wise beyond his years. Always trying to be progressive as well as do the right thing. Always challenging himself to his greatest ability," Ellefsen remembered. He last saw Doherty a week before the final mission to Libya. "I stayed in his house (in California), we paddled out in the ocean together, spent some good quality time." Ellefsen said Doherty recalled meeting Mitt Romney years ago, but the account was much different from what the Presidential candidate retold in Iowa. According to Ellefsen, Romney introduced himself to Doherty four separate times during the gathering. "He said it was very comical," Ellefsen said, "Mitt Romney approached him ultimately four times, using this private gathering as a political venture to further his image. He kept introducing himself as Mitt Romney, a political figure. The same introduction, the same opening line. Glen believed it to be very insincere and stale." Ellefsen said Doherty remembered Romney as robotic. "He said it was pathetic and comical to have the same person come up to you within only a half hour, have this person reintroduce himself to you, having absolutely no idea whatsoever that he just did this 20 minutes ago, and did not even recognize Glen's face." Ellefsen described Glen Doherty as a humble, non-political guy, and said it was ironic for him to be used during a presidential campaign. "Whether it be Republican, Democrat, Green Party, Libertarian, it doesn't make a difference. Because this guy is using our great friend, our humble, and honorable great friend...who is truly larger than life...He has become part of the soapbox routine for politics in a presidential race." Ellefsen said he understands why people would want to link themselves with Doherty. "Of all people to tie yourself to for advancement in life, it's not surprising that Romney or anybody else would want to tie themselves to Glen Doherty. Because he was incredible. And I can honestly say beyond a shadow of a doubt, he was the greatest person I have ever met in my life." I asked Ellefsen what he thought of his friend's story being used on the political stump: "Honestly it does make me sick. Glen would definitely not approve of it. He probably wouldn't do much about it. He probably wouldn't say a whole lot about it. I think Glen would feel, more than anything, almost embarrassed for Romney. I think he would feel pity for him."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349895756438</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 15:02:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349896722714-40</Id><Title>Can Christians vote for a Mormon?</Title><Msg>" by Vitruvianman Yeah, don't worry right wing Christians will prove they don't stand for anything by voting for a Mormon. Remember, just a few years ago, Christians believed Mormonism was a cult. But suddenly they have changed their minds because the Mormon has an "R" next to his name and the Christian has a "D.". One reason why Christians despised the Mormon religion is because Joseph Smith claims that God told him to create it because all of the other religions were wrong (that includes Christianity). Thus, Smith basically said Christianity was a fraud. I just cannot vote for a Mormon. Sorry, but I just don't trust the mindset of a guy who believes in the Joseph Smith story. Smith was a con man. He was convicted of glass looking, the same act he claims to have used to decipher and write the Mormon text; looking at glass or rocks inside of a hat and claiming to get magical visions. I also cannot vote for a guy that believes what Mormons believe. They believe: 1. God is a white male that lives on an alternative planet made of glass called Kolob (Don't remember the bible mentioning this part). 2. That the first man and woman and thus the Garden of Eden, not the promise land of Jerusalem or Africa, but Missouri. Yes the one in the United States. 3. They believe in many Gods not just one and they believe that if you follow the laws of the Church closely (give a ton of money) then when you die you get to become the God of your own planet. 4. They believe in Magical underwear, that if you wear it (it looks like old time single Long Johns) it will protect you from evil. 5. They believe that Native Americans are really ancient Israelites that came here before anyone else by boats. 6. They believe black people are black because God cursed them and they are forbidden from entering any kind of heaven or becoming a God of another planet. 7. The religion was started in the 19th CENTURY for Pete's sake. Yet, for some unknown reason Smith wrote the Mormon bible using 17th century English. I guess he thought 17th Century was really old and therefore people would think if it reads older then it must be true? As Richard Dawkins pointed out, this is absurd. In the 19th century, the century in which Smith lived and when he wrote this book, NOBODY spoke in 17th century English, so what's the point in writing it in that style? Again, I think he figured if it looked older then people would buy it. Also, a little bit about Smith. Besides being a con man, he said he had always heard voices dating back to when he was a kid. Smith was also an acting communist. He started the communal settlement called the United Order of Enoch. He also conned his believers into putting all of their money into a quasi-bank and claimed their money would come back ten folds. He lost all of their money in about a few months. This caused a big riff amongst his followers and many wanted to kill him but he was able to leave and move further west while many of his followers decided to just leave him and go back home. Smith also requested to permission to secede from the Union. He wanted his communist settlement to be allowed to secede. However, at the same time he was requesting to leave the union, he was also requesting Welfare from the federal government. He claimed they needed the welfare because everywhere they tried to settle their religion was being prosecuted. As for the current Church, it mandates that you give to the organization a percentage of your income. If you are wealthy, they do not waiver on this criteria. In many instances former members of the Church that worked in the business department said they sometimes require rich members to provide tax returns to make certain they are giving the exact percentage to the organization. If they don't then they lose their privileges in the church and could possible be kicked out and they most certainly lose their ability to become a God of another planet once they die. Mormonism, is not far off from Scientology in terms of what they believe (alien Gods and obviously made up stuff). I would no less vote for a Scientologist than I would a Mormon. Oh and I haven't even started to tell you about the rituals they do. Pretty disturbing. You can google them if you want to know. And those are some reasons I won't be voting for Mitt."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349896722714</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 15:18:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349897706646-41</Id><Topic><Title>President Romney WINS in Landslide!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1348835996084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 08:39:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would Anybody take you seriously when you are useing Multiple I.D.'s in the offer?...</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1349897706646</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 15:35:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349901869798-42</Id><Topic><Title>Another Obama achievement</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1349738634573</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 19:23:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The weasel speaks, but still no answer, what's up with that?</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1349901869798</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 16:44:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349902664966-43</Id><Title>The truth about the phoney 7.8% unemployment number</Title><Msg>Jack Welch's take on the baloney numbers put out by BLS.

A further review of the report finds that the sole example included of a foreign-national donor giving to the Obama campaign was, in fact, based on a translation error. The GAI’s report, America the Vulnerable: Are Foreign and Fraudulent Online Campaign Contributions Influencing U.S. Elections? cited a Norwegian blog as an example of an apparent non-citizen claiming to have illegally contributed to a U.S. political campaign: A Norwegian blogger posts a solicitation from the Obama campaign, including the link to the donate page. When another blogger opines that non-U.S. citizens cannot contribute because of American law, the blogger responds in Norwegian, “I have in practice given money to Obama, I had done it.” The footnote for this claim links to a blogger anmed “Gaupefot.” His comment, in Norweigian, was: Jeg mottar nok bare epost fra Obama. Pøvde å donere penger til John Kerry i 2004. Det gikk dessverre ikke. Forøvrig har ikke USA noe de skulle sagt på det området. De tar heller livet av utenlandske politikere. Pengedonasjoner blir for pingler slik de ser det. CIA har forøvrig gitt penger til Det norske arbeiderparti, og antakeligvis også til andre norske partier og politske grupperinger. Hadde jeg i praksis kunne gitt penger til Obama hadde jeg gjort det. The GAI report’s authors apparently relied on Google Translator for their translation of that final line. ThinkProgress confirmed with three Norwegian speakers, including a University of North Dakota professor of Norwegian language, that the quote actually means quite the opposite. Gaupefot’s comment claims a failed 2004 attempt to donate to John Kerry’s campaign. The correct translation of the last line is, essentially, “If I actually could have given money to Obama, I would have done it.” The GAI did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the report and on this glaring error. It is unclear how many of the other translations throughout the report report also relied on Google Translator — a literal translation service that is incapable of understanding nuance or context. Despite a wide array of irresponsible headlines, it is now clear that the authors did not find a single example of a foreigner donating to the Obama re-election campaign.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1349905052341</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 17:37:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349906140289-45</Id><Title>Dumbo Super SCANDAL!!!</Title><Msg>Dumbo LIES, Ambassadors DIES!!!

Ignoring a request from the mother of one of the Navy SEALs killed last month in Libya, Mitt Romney today once again told a campaign audience of meeting with her son at a Christmas party two years ago. After Romney told his story of meeting Glen Doherty during a campaign rally yesterday, Barbara Doherty—mother of Glen Doherty, one of the Navy SEALs killed in the Benghazi attack—had asked Romney to stop using her son's memory to advance his political agenda. 7News spoke with Doherty’s mother. "I don't trust Romney. He shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda. It's wrong to use these brave young men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama,” said Barbara Doherty, Glen’s mother. There was no response from the Romney camp. And today, Romney gave his response: he'd rather continue "humanizing" himself on the campaign trail than respect a grieving mother's wishes. 10:37 AM PT: As you might guess, Romneyland is now trying to beat a hasty retreat: Asked whether Romney would continue to tell the story, a campaign aide told BuzzFeed he would not, now that he knew the mother's wishes. Kevin Madden added, "Governor Romney was inspired by the memory of meeting Glen Doherty and shared his story and that memory. We respect the wishes of Mrs. Doherty though." Funny how the campaign didn't care about her wishes until the national media started asking questions.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1349907729176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 18:22:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349908551496-50</Id><Title>Damn JB...Use Your Hand For Something Else!...</Title><Msg>You index finger Has to be getting Tired...

Melinda Wadsley of Ames, Iowa, told The Associated Press that she could not in good conscience vote for party nominee Mitt Romney. Wadsley was among three electors who had told the AP for a story published Thursday that they were exploring alternatives should Romney win their states. ‘‘I have always been a straight ticket Republican, and for the first time in my life I am an undecided voter, therefore, I need to resign my position as a Republican presidential elector,’’ Wadsley said in an email exchange. Iowa GOP Chairman A.J. Spiker said in a statement that the state party’s central committee would begin the process of selecting a replacement, essentially allowing the party to confirm a die-hard Romney supporter. Wadsley and others had expressed frustration at how Republican leaders have worked to suppress Paul’s conservative movement and his legion of loyal supporters. ‘‘They've never given Ron Paul a fair shot, and I'm disgusted with that. I'd like to show them how disgusted I am,’’ Wadsley had told the AP earlier, saying she was considering withholding her electoral vote from Romney. She is an Iowa mother of three who was selected as a Republican elector earlier this year and said Paul was the better choice. She had also noted that the Electoral College was founded with the idea that electors wouldn’t just mimic the popular vote. The defection of multiple electors would be unprecedented in the last 116 years of U.S. politics. It also would raise the remote possibility that the country could even end up with a president and vice president from different parties. If Romney prevailed in an extremely close presidential election, for example, defections could deprive him of the Electoral College majority needed to secure the presidency. That would throw the presidential election to the U.S. House for the first time in nearly two centuries. The Senate would elect the vice president if neither running mate got a majority of the electoral votes. If Republicans retained control of the House, and with the each state delegation getting a single vote, Romney probably would prevail. But if the Senate remained in Democratic hands, Vice President Joe Biden would be the favorite. Because so-called faithless electors are rare, the position of elector is largely viewed as symbolic. Each party chooses people to serve as electors in the 50 states, and electors from the winning party convene in each state capital in December to officially select the president and vice president. As Paul supporters fought for more prestigious delegate slots during state-level conventions this year, they also quietly accrued electors — some in Democratic states likely to be won by President Barack Obama, but also in a handful in states that Romney could take. In Nevada, for example, Paul’s forces seized control of the state convention and won a majority of delegates. They also placed four Paul supporters among the state’s six electors. The electors said they have had no organized discussion over how to cast their electoral votes and there have been no efforts by the campaigns to get them to vote for either Paul or Romney. Nevada’s electors are approaching their duties in different ways. Jesse Law, an elector and Paul supporter, said he may have qualms with Romney but has always intended to cast his electoral vote for the party nominee. ‘‘I just want to beat Obama,’’ Law said. But Ken Eastman may not cast his Nevada electoral vote for Romney, if the former Massachusetts governor wins the state. Eastman said he wants to explore options with Republican leaders in Clark County, a group now dominated by Paul supporters. ‘‘I'm undecided at this point,’’ Eastman said, adding that he’s ‘‘pretty disgusted’’ with the national Republican Party and how it has worked to suppress Paul’s grassroots movement. He said the GOP has not been open to an influx of people with different ideas. In Texas, elector Billie Zimmerman said she sees Paul as the only candidate able to save the country. She considers Romney and running mate Paul Ryan to be just another couple of Republicans who will disappoint her, and she called the GOP convention a ‘‘shocking display of deception and treachery and cheating.’’ Zimmerman said she hasn’t decided how she'll cast her electoral vote.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1349910148295</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:02:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349911865104-56</Id><Title>Dipshidiot's moral bankruptcy</Title><Msg>Wednesday, Oct 10, 2012 03:50 PM PDT Nine ways Mitt is morally bankrupt If true morality is evidenced by how one treats his fellow man, Romney’s reputation should be under water By Adele M. Stan, Alternet In the psychic make-up of any politician, the phenomenon of compartmentalization is common, but rare is the politician who proudly makes an art of it, as has Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Even as he publicly celebrates his squeaky-clean personal life, Romney lauds his own brutal record as a leveraged buyout specialist and lies with impunity on the stump, often in terms laden with race-baiting code. AlterNet To Romney, it seems, personal morality amounts to a roster of good personal habits (no smoking or drinking, a faithful marriage, generosity and compassion for ailing members of his faith community) that add up to a kind of personal exceptionalism that trumps whatever havoc his business behavior or political policies may wreak on the life of any poor schlub who should should cross his path. Romney’s sense of morality seems to be based on a kind of fierce individualism, in which he apparently believes himself to be morally superior by dint of his own personal habits, and assumes no responsibility for the fate of those less rigorous in their personal code, should they find an appeal to their baser instincts in the words and actions of the beyond-reproach church leader, dutiful husband and father of five. It all amounts to a kind of moral bankruptcy, in which the former Massachusetts governor presumes he is entitled to a morally superior reputation for which he has not kept up the payments. It’s not that hard to be good to your family and friends. If true morality is evidenced by how one treats strangers, Romney’s reputation as a moral actor should be under water. Here are but nine bits of evidence of the moral bankruptcy of Willard Mitt Romney. There exist many more, but life is short. 1. The smug non-smoker took big bucks to push smoking on Russians. No one is more satisfied with his Ivory-soap self-image (99.43% pure) than Romney, and one aspect of that is Romney’s evident pride in never having been a smoker. But that didn’t stop him, while CEO of Bain &amp; Company, from seeking a consulting deal, beginning in 1992, with the British American Tobacco company to help the death merchants crack the Russian market after the fall of the Soviet Union. According to a blockbuster report by Huffington Post reporter (and AlterNet alum) Zach Carter and his colleague, Jason Cherkis, Romney appears to have been deeply involved in helping to increase the numbers of Russian smokers on behalf of BAT. From Carter and Cherkis’ report: In 1992, reports showed that only 7 percent of Russian women smoked. Since BAT and other Western companies have taken over Russian markets, that number has more than tripled. In 2009, the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, cited by the World Health Organization, reported that nearly 22 percent of Russian women had taken up the habit. The same survey found that smoking rates among Russian men — already high before Communism’s fall — have also risen since Bain’s tobacco exploits of the early-’90s, with [more than 30] percent now smoking. Nearly 44 million smoke in Russia, a country of 142 million. Dmitriy Yanin, the head of a consumer protection non-governmental organization in Moscow, said there are 400,000 smoking-related deaths each year in Russia. BAT, largely locked out of the cigarette market before Bain got involved, now controls nearly a quarter of sales. BAT remains close with top government officials. 2. Slams government economic investment despite having taken government contracts. As a presidential candidate, Romney is fond of slamming the Obama administration’s stimulus program, and other government investment in the economy. “Government doesn’t create jobs. It’s the private sector that creates jobs,” Romney said at a South Carolina campaign event in January. The auto industry, he said, should have been left to bottom out in the wake of the Bush crash, instead of being brought back to health by the loans provided by the administration. Never mind that Romney himself got a nice windfall from a government contract, according to Carter and Cherkis: In March 1993, the American government gave Bain &amp; Co. a $3.9 million contract to advise Boris Yeltsin’s administration on the privatization of the Russian economy, according records detailing the arrangement uncovered by The Huffington Post. 3. Opposes abortion, but invested in company that disposes of aborted fetuses. Just because Mitt Romney would make it illegal to have an abortion doesn’t mean he minds making a profit on other people’s abortions. In 1999, while Mitt Romney was still CEO of Bain Capital (a leveraged-buyout firm spun off from Bain &amp; Co.), the company invested tens of millions of dollars in Stericyle, a medical waste firm that, among the vast array of medical waste services it provides to medical facilities, is the disposal of aborted fetuses. The Huffington Post’s Sam Stein broke the story in January, writing: Stericycle, a massive medical waste disposal service company, received a $75 million investment from Bain Capital in 1999 and soon became an industry leader. Today, it has more than 485,000 customers worldwide. Its clients include hospitals, blood banks, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. But it has also helped dispose of medical waste from Planned Parenthood and abortion clinics — waste that included aborted fetuses — and that has attracted the ire of the pro-life community and establishment Republicans.</Msg><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1349911865104</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:31:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349912031859-57</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot's moral bankruptcy</Title><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1349911865104</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:31:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4. Decries corruption in other countries but facilitated it in his own. In his address to the Clinton Global Initiative in September, Romney bemoaned the state of affairs in developing countries, saying, “We see stories of cases where American aid has been diverted to corrupt governments.” But when it comes to good ol’ domestic corruption, Romney seems to be all for it — at least when it’s in his own interest. In fact, it could be argued that he even gave out an award for it. The 2002 winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, which Romney oversaw, were renowned for their outsized expense. Some of that was incurred before Romney took the helm — he was brought in after reports of rampant overspending and corruption — but not all of it. In 2001, Sports Illustrated reported that the millionaires and billionaires of Utah got some sweetheart deals, at government expense, served up with roses on Romney’s watch. One example among several given is the nice little land swap that billionaire Earl Holding wrangled out of the National Park Service that netted him a prime parcel and a government-built access road. So it made total sense that he would build a high-end resort on that bucolic expanse. Here’s how Mother Jones‘ Tim Murphy described the deal: Snowbasin, the site of the downhill skiing championships in 2002, was one of the more notorious examples of a well-connected Utahn getting a sweetheart deal in the name of the Olympics. Earl Holding, a billionaire oil baron, pressured the Forest Service into giving him title to valuable land in Park Valley in exchange for land of “approximate equal value” elsewhere in the state. But Holding drove a hard bargain; he got Congress to foot the bill for a new—and arguably unnecessary—access road (cost: $15 million), and received more than 10 times the 100 acres that were necessary for the Games. That would allow him to turn what was once protected federal land into a massive, and lucrative, mountain resort. The government was so instrumental in making the Olympic games happen that Romney created a special award, the “Order of Excellence,” to honor public servants who had helped them pull it off. Among the recipients: John Hoagland, the US Forest Service official responsible for the land transfer of the Snowbasin downhill skiing site. 5. Insults low-income Americans for not paying federal income tax, while not paying federal income tax on almost all of his income. Romney famously described people whose income level (or status as members of the armed forces) exempts them from paying federal income taxes as takers who “see themselves as victims.” In a secretly recorded video, exposed by Mother Jones, of Romney speaking to other rich people at a campaign fundraiser, he described such people, many of whom are elderly and on Social Security, as those “who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that’s an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what…These are people who pay no income tax.” But Romney doesn’t pay ordinary income tax on his annual income, either; he pays federal capital gains taxes — taxes on paid on investment income at a much lower rate than those paid on salaries and wages (otherwise known as money earned from work). That explains why Romney paid only 14 percent on the gazillions he took in in 2011, while a middle-income person may pay almost double that percentage. Asked by 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley whether Romney thinks that’s fair, Romney said, why yes. As I recounted Pelley’s interview on September 23: “Now, you made on your investments last year about $20 million personally, and you paid 14 percent in federal taxes,” Pelley said. “That’s the capital gains rate. Is that fair to the guy who makes $50,000 and paid a higher rate than you did?” “It is a low rate,” Romney said, “and one of the reasons the capital gains rate is lower is because capital has already been taxed once, at the corporate level — as high as 35 percent.” (Unless your windfall comes from any of the numerous private enterprises that enjoy government subsidies or tax breaks, of course.) “So you think it is fair,” Pelley said. “Yeah — I think it’s the right way to encourage economic growth — to get people to invest, to start businesses, to put people to work.” Actually, there’s scant evidence to suggest that lower capital gains rates have any effect on either job creation or economic growth. And while he demeaned as moochers regular Americans who pay no income tax because the law exempts them, he sings a different tune when tax law advantages rich guys like him. “I pay all the taxes that are legally required, not a dollar more,” he said, according to Vanity Fair. But if you’re poor and you do the same, in Romney’s moral desert, that makes you a leech on society. 6. Calls for more transparency from his opponent while hiding his own tax returns, squirreling millions offshore and using accounting tricks to lower his tax rate. Romney’s call for the Obama administration to be more forthcoming about everything from the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya, to the cross-border gun-tracking program known as Fast and Furious would be more credible if Romney wasn’t such a sneak when it comes to matters pertaining to how he makes all that money. For a guy who hasn’t had a job in 10 years, he sure does rake it in — $20 million last year alone. As repeatedly noted on this site and throughout the news media, Romney has released only two years of his tax returns and has said he will release no more. “We’ve given you people all you need to know and understand about our financial situation…,” Romney’s wife, Ann, told Good Morning America in August. The Romney reticence on all matters of personal finance has only fanned the flames of investigation and speculation, yielding a picture of a tangled web of offshore shell companies, a Swiss bank account, and shady tax-filing tricks. Vanity Fair‘s Nicholas Shaxon notes that Romney appears to have closed his $3 million Swiss bank account before filing his 2011 tax return, but reports that he still maintains an interest in 12 Bain Capital funds registered in the Cayman Islands, the details of which, Shaxon says, are “hidden behind controversial confidentiality disclaimers.” Of particular interest to reporters has been a Bermuda firm owned by Romney known as Sakaty High Yield Asset Investors Ltd., which Shaxon writes, is raising eyebrows: While the Romneys’ spokespeople insist that the couple has paid all the taxes required by law, investments in tax havens such as Bermuda raise many questions, because they are in “jurisdictions where there is virtually no tax and virtually no compliance,” as one Miami-based offshore lawyer put it. Then there’s the matter of a funky accounting practice known as management fee-waiving, which was all the rage at Bain. Leveraged buyout firms such as Bain collect management fees from the companies they take over (whether or not those companies turn a profit, thanks to the LBO firm’s sage advice). Left to their own devices, those fees would be taxed as ordinary income, at the ordinary-income rates paid on wages and salaries. But if wave the magic waiver wand over them, those fees turn into “investments,” which are taxed as “carried interest” at the lower capital gains rate. Here’s how Nick Confessore, Julie Creswell and David Kocieniewski of the New York Times #$%$ the practice, as used by Bain: The tax strategy — which is viewed as perfectly legal by some tax experts, aggressive by others and potentially illegal by some — came to light last month when hundreds of pages of Bain’s internal financial documents were made available online. The financial statements show that at least $1 billion in accumulated fees that otherwise would have been taxed as ordinary income for Bain executives had been converted into investments producing capital gains, which are subject to a federal tax of 15 percent, versus a top rate of 35 percent for ordinary income. That means the Bain partners saved more than $200 million in federal income taxes and more than $20 million in Medicare taxes. (For more on shady Bain practices, read Brian Beutler at TPM and Kris E. Benson at Wonkette.) Then there’s the matter of Romney’s individual retirement account, which he seems to have converted into an individual tax haven. As the Boston Globe‘s Michael Kralish and Beth Healy told it in an August report: It is one of the most striking elements of Mitt Romney’s financial fortune. He has used the seemingly bland investment vehicle known as an individual retirement account — established by Congress to help average Americans save a modest amount for retirement — to shield at least $20 million and as much as $100 million from initial taxes. So much for transparency.</Msg><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1349912031859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:33:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349912088350-58</Id><Topic><Title>Dipshidiot's moral bankruptcy</Title><Username>hooveredbyndavis</Username><Timestamp>1349911865104</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:31:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>7. Painted his opponent as a fibbing child while building an entire campaign on lies. In the first presidential debate between Romney and Obama, the Republican presidential candidate compared the African-American president to his “boys,” who, when they were little, he said, would pile fib upon fib thinking they could fool their dad. It was an audacious tack for the truth-challenged Romney, whose most furious attacks on Obama have been based almost entirely on lies. The very theme of the first night of the Republican National Convention was built around a deliberate misrepresentation of the president’s words regarding the role of government in building small businesses — a false narrative that Romney repeated often on the campaign trail, alleging that the president had insulted the work of small business owners, saying of their businesses, “You didn’t build that.” (Actually, Obama said they hadn’t built the roads and bridges that brought customers to their doors.) The convention was themed “We built that,” and featured a deceptively edited video of Obama’s inelegant attempt to echo a message originated by Democratic U.S. Senate Elizabeth Warren, Mass., meant to shine a light on all of the infrastructure built by government that is necessary for economic success: roads, bridges, railroads, schools. On the very day of the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens, Romney falsely accused the president of sympathizing with the attackers. Stevens’ body had not yet been returned home for burial. Then there was the race-baiting welfare lie, in which Romney falsely accused the black president of removing the work requirements for welfare recipients that were enacted in the Clinton-era welfare reform law. That was one particularly despicable lie, since Romney seized upon an effort by the administration allow states new ways of increasing the numbers of welfare recipients who worked, and twisted it to suggest that the black president was on a mission to give handouts to people on welfare, who, among members of the Republican base, are mistakenly believed to be primarily black. This is a mere sampling of the mendacity the Mittster has served up along the trail. In the debate alone, ThinkProgress counted 27 myths delivered by Romney over the course of 38 minutes, and AlterNet’s own Alex Kane picked his own list of Romney’s top 10 debate lies. And lest you think this Romney lie narrative to be an alternative-media conspiracy, just look at what CNN found when its fact-checkers examined Romney’s statements. I’ve only scratched the surface here on the Romney lie front, but I know you don’t have all day. 8. Claims to have the “best interests of the African American community” in his heart while running a race-baiting campaign. When Romney appeared before the annual conference of the NAACP this summer, he assured its members that, if they knew what was good for them, they would vote for him. (For some reason that didn’t go over all that well.) “I believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African American families, you would vote for me for president,” Romney told the skeptical crowd. The speech is remembered mostly for the boos Romney received with his promise to “repeal Obamacare” — boos he surely expected to elicit. Given the context, it’s hard not to read Romney’s very appearance before the crowd as a cynical, race-baiting exercise, performed to reinforce the racial resentment of the white, right-wing Republican base. Part of that context was provided just hours after that appearance by the candidate himself when, at a fundraising event, he referred to the less-than-appreciative audience as a group who wanted “free stuff” from the government. But from the get-go, Romney has run a campaign heavily laced with racial coding, from comments by his surrogate, John Sununu, depicting Obama as “lazy” and “foreign,” to Romney’s own appearance at the side of the birther Donald Trump. Asked to repudiate Trumps claim that Obama was not legitimately the U.S. president, Romney refused, saying that he needed 50.1 percent of the vote. As if that was an excuse. A month later, he made a crack that no one has ever asked him for his birth certificate. Neither has Romney repudiated the endorsement of washed-up rocker Ted Nugent, whose idea of a good time is to wear a shirt emblazoned with the Confederate flag, and call for the African-American president to “suck on my machine gun.” And, as noted in item #7, Romney has tried to falsely link the black president with a (non-existent) loosening of welfare-to-work requirements. There’s more, lots more, where that came from and, lucky for you, AlterNet has documented much of it, here and here. 9. Wears the mantle of protectionist, China-battling job creator after having put thousands of U.S. workers out of jobs and bought into a giant Chinese sweatshop. Romney likes to portray his work at the helm of Bain Capital as a mission of job creation. In truth, Bain exists for no other reason than to extract profits for its investors, and sometimes the best way for a leveraged buyout firm to make a profit is to bankrupt the company. You see, the buyout guys get management fees whether the company wins or loses, so even if you load it up with a crushing level of debt, you still come out a winner. Sometimes Romney’s deals created jobs; other times they put people out of work. ThinkProgress estimates that as many as 6,000 Americans lost their jobs under Bain, which was an early proponent of shipping jobs overseas. Writing at Bloomberg News, private equity specialist Anthony Luzzatto Gardner examined Romney’s record at Bain, concluding that of the 67 major deals the company made during Romney’s tenure, a mere 10 of them accounted for 70 percent of the company’s profits. Of those 10, four ended in bankruptcy, Gardner writes, along with others amid the remaining 57. This kind of “casino capitalism,” as Gardner calls it, is not a recipe for job creation. Meanwhile in China, Romney and Bain invested in a factory that employed 20,000 young women in deplorable conditions, trapped within the factory complex by barbed wire and guards posted in towers. As AlterNet’s Lynn Parramorereported: From April 1998 through August 2000, Romney and his Brookside Capital Partners Fund, a Bain affiliate, poured around $23 million into the Global-Tech sweatshop in Dongguan, China. Among the details outlined in the report were the following: Factory workers made 24 cents an hour in 1998 and less than $2 a day. Wages in Global-Tech were less than 2 percent of U.S. wages. As CEO, Romney appears to have been uninterested in calling for improvements at the facility. Today, the sweatshop is still a horror where starvation wages prevail and workers’ rights are nonexistent. Overcrowded, filthy dormitories; rotten food; routine 15- to 16-hour shifts; and backbreaking 105- to 112-hour, seven-day workweeks are the norm. The appliance factory has 800 student “interns” — 16-years-olds forced to work repetitive, exhausting 15- to 16-hour shifts on assembly lines with no overtime pay. Not exactly the kind of jobs Americans are looking for.

But we know the truth about where he stands on a woman’s right to choose – he’s said he’d be delighted to sign a bill banning all abortions, and called Roe v. Wade ‘one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history’ while pledging to appoint Supreme Court justices who will overturn it," said Lis Smith, a campaign spokesperson for Obama. "Women simply can’t trust him." Romney told the Des Moines Register Tuesday that he didn't plan to put forward new abortion laws. “There’s no legislation with regards to abortion that I’m familiar with that would become part of my agenda," he told the paper.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349913443972</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 19:57:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349915305603-61</Id><Title>Barry Levinson visits the "Lying Institute"</Title><Msg>The Age of Insanity - Part 3, Another Report From the Lying Institute of America Posted: 10/10/2012 12:55 pm "A debate is where truth goes to die." That was the first line out of the mouth of Dr. R.H. Flutes, head of the Lying Institute of America. Following the first debate between Romney and Obama, I decided to visit him once again. He went on to say: Dr. R.H. Flutes: "A lie here and there is not a good tactic. Consistent lying is the best course of action because it is seamless... a lie leading to a lie. It is not unlike a well-written piece of music. Fluid. Coherent. And best of all, it makes us feel good." And then I asked, "And you have no reservations about the idea of lying to millions and millions of Americans and the morality of deception?" And at that moment I have to be honest with you, the doctor upon hearing my statement began to laugh so hard he doubled up in his chair. It must have been over a minute before he composed himself. And then he said: "We are a nation of sugar freaks. Give us something that satisfies us for a few minutes at a time and we will forgive and forget everything. We have virtually forgotten about the Iraq War. The thousands upon thousands who died. The chaos. The instability in the region. Over 2 trillion of our dollars down the drain. Our young men and women killed, wounded. Where is the outrage? Most Americans don't even know what happened or care. And why don't they care? Good lies. Constant lying. Consistent lying. A lie that flows into a lie that flows into a lie." Q: "What did you think of the recent Romney Obama debate?" Dr. R.H. Flutes: "Wonderful lying on Romney's part. Seamless lying. Except that Big Bird comment." Q: "Why point to that moment?" Dr. R.H. Flutes: "Because that was the only true thing he said all night. And that became the story. The truth stuck out among all the lies. I'll say it again -- our motto at the institute is, 'Lie from beginning to end.' It is engraved over our entryway.? Q: "But the Big Bird story did not go anywhere. It just became a joke." Dr. R.H. Flutes: "Fortunately. And none of the media picked up on his real feelings about PBS. He got close to opening up Pandora's Box, and that truth could have gotten him in real trouble." Q: "Can you explain, doctor?" Dr. R.H. Flutes: "Romney doesn't care about Sesame Street. He doesn't care about Big Bird. The 400 million dollars it cost the government is pocket change. He wants to get rid of PBS because it is the only news service that is not beholden to any corporations. From time to time, all networks run into conflicts with sponsors. That's just a fact of life. Not PBS. No conservative wants a Frontline documentary exposing this or that. It's just not worth it. Why take any chance? There's no upside for big business." Q: "I see." Dr. R.H. Flutes: "Romney doesn't want to get rid of Big Bird. He just wants Big Bird sold by Kellogs. And what he's really saying is, I want PBS News to have commercials. That's the firewall to protect his corporate America." And then he smiled. Dr. R.H. Flutes: "Truth is a pesky thing. Think about it. One truthful moment in 90 minutes, and it was all over the airwaves. Fortunately that unspoken truth wasn't deciphered."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1349915305603</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 20:28:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349917571441-62</Id><Title>Credit goes to Bush!!!</Title><Msg>July 20, 2007 A Stock Market Vote of Confidence for Bush By Lawrence Kudlow It has been widely reported that President Bush simply refuses to turn against the surge in Iraq, or even compromise on it. At the same time, he admonishes Congress to toss out troop-withdrawal timetables and to give Gen. Petraeus' new counterinsurgency plan time to work. And you know what? While the Democrats stand against nearly all of the president's wartime policies -- and in the process court defeat -- the stock market is standing with Bush, and the chance for victory. Early last week, when the Democratic leadership of Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi launched their latest antiwar offensive, stocks dropped about 150 points. Then, in a press conference a few days later, after Bush discussed clear successes in Iraq's Anbar province, the Dow Jones soared nearly 300 points, marching ever closer to the 14,000-point plateau. Of course, shares trade on the profit and interest-rate fundamentals of the economy. But if you ask folks on Wall Street what their biggest worry is, most will say it's another 9-11. They rank another attack far ahead of passing sub-prime mortgage problems or wiggles in consumer spending. The stock market, in fact, is voting for the president to stay on offense. Here's a case in point. The highest-ranking Iraqi leader of al-Qaida in Iraq was just arrested, after which he told interrogators that Osama bin Laden's inner circle enjoys considerable influence over the Iraqi al-Qaida branch. "Communication between the senior al-Qaida leadership and al-Masri frequently went through al-Mashhadani," said Brigadier Gen. Kevin Bergner. "There is a clear connection between al-Qaida in Iraq and al-Qaida senior leadership outside Iraq." And Wall Street connected the dots, too: That day, the Dow had been down 150 points. But it rallied back 100 points after the Iraqi capture came across the tape. This brings me to a larger point. Despite the criticism President Bush has received over his Iraq War policies, isn't it interesting that stock markets have been booming since early 2003, when Saddam was overthrown and the president signed his supply-side tax cuts into law? (Bush, of course, never gets any credit on either of these points.) In just the past year alone, the Dow has gained a remarkable 30 percent. Meanwhile, Europe and Asia are up about 30 percent, Japan 23 percent, and emerging markets more than 60 percent. Clearly, the world is voting -- with real money -- for the American system of free-market capitalism. And it's my strong suspicion that the majority of the global investing community supports the Iraq War and a steadfast U.S. commitment to stop terrorism. They seem to know that if the United States doesn't do it, no one else will. I have long believed that stock markets are the best barometer of the health, wealth and security of a nation. And today's stock market message is an unmistakable vote of confidence for the president. Even the best low-tax, limited-government economic policies can be thwarted if the men and women going to work in the morning can't get safely back to their homes and families at night. And the fact that the world economy is experiencing the greatest economic boom in history is a direct rebuke to jihadists everywhere. Al-Qaida despises our country and its capitalist freedoms. And unless stopped cold in its tracks, it will strive to destroy the U.S. financial system and free-market development around the world. The spread of free trade, the free movement of capital, low taxes and the breathtaking rise of the Internet -- these are generating more jobs, wealth and prosperity than ever before. And this amounts to a collective thumbing of the nose at the terrorists. It's as though world markets are saying that history is on our side and that the crazed self-proclaimed terrorist clerics will ultimately be defeated. Free-market capitalism, 10; al-Qaida, 0. And just as Bush won't give up on the surge, he's not about to default to the Democrats on the supply-side investment tax cuts that helped deliver a near six-year economic boom. "I'm not going to raise taxes," he told me in a recent White House meeting of conservative columnists, and he pledges to veto non-defense appropriation bills that exceed a $933 billion line in the sand. He also vows to work overtime to get a free-trade deal with the pro-American countries of Colombia and Peru, not only to expand economic activity, but also to counter the anti-American and socialist policies of Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. The media like to paint Bush into a bunker, making him the victim of a torrent of criticism from which they say he can't recover. But here are the plain facts: The president's tax cuts helped reinvigorate investors and businesses. The nation has been safe from attack for nearly six years. And Petraeus' counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq just may be working. In other words, Bush deserves a lot more credit than most are willing to give him.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349917571441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 21:06:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349922919085-63</Id><Title>Bob Cesca: Obama Cut the Deficit and Slowed Spending to Lowest Level in 50 Years</Title><Msg>Posted: 10/10/2012 3:43 pm Illustrative of his contempt for the truth, Mitt Romney's campaign website continues to host the following statement: "Since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history." On Friday, we discovered yet another reason why this is a super-colossal lie. With the end of fiscal year 2012, the Congressional Budget Office announced the 2012 federal budget deficit: $1.1 trillion. Taken purely at face value, this number is enormous. Yet every Democrat, and especially the Obama campaign, ought to be telling anyone who will listen: Not only has the president cut the deficit by $312 billion during his first term (so far), but he's cut the deficit by $200 billion in the past year alone. And the CBO projected that the 2013 Obama budget, if enacted as is, would shrink the deficit to $977 billion -- a four year total of nearly $500 billion in deficit reduction. Okay, yeah, I get it. It's risky to mention the deficit, but not when you couch it in math and the facts. As I've documented before, the CBO reported in January, 2009 that the federal budget deficit for that fiscal year, which began on October 1, 2008, was already $1.2 trillion. President Obama's additional '09 spending added another $200 billion to the deficit, bringing the total to $1.412 trillion. Unprecedented and huge, but given the enormity of the financial crisis and the depth of the recession, there weren't many other options on the table. Add two wars into the mix and there you go. But since then, deficit spending has dropped precipitously. Why? Chiefly because President Obama signed the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act in February, 2010, which mandates that new spending be offset with spending cuts or new revenue. Yes, a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress passed this legislation. Guess how many congressional Republicans voted for the law. Zero. Not one. Perhaps during this week's debate, Vice President Biden could ask Rep. Paul Ryan who voted against the bill. Consequently, the president is responsible for the lowest government spending growth in 60 years, according to the Wall Street Journal's Market Watch. 2012-10-10-chart_spending_growth.jpg Once again, Mitt Romney's website still contains the words: "Since President Obama assumed office three years ago, federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history." Pants on fire times a thousand. Fact: the president's record is exactly the opposite of what Romney says. And how long ago was this statistic released by the Wall Street Journal and subsequently affirmed by fact checkers? Five months ago. On September 26, when asked about his record of mendacious claims, Mitt Romney told CNN's Jim Acosta, "We've been absolutely spot on. And any time there's been anything that's been amiss, we correct it or remove it." Oh yeah? Well, Mr. Romney, you missed a whopper. Another whopper: during Romney's "winning" debate against the president last week, he claimed, "The president said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it." Another lie. Yes, the president said he'd cut the deficit in half -- but he absolutely did not double it. As I've outlined here, he's cut the deficit by 22 percent so far -- 35 percent by the end of 2013. Furthermore, I can name two Democratic presidents who've cut the deficit through the duration of their presidencies: Clinton and Obama. And what about Republican presidents? Bush 43? He turned a $200 billion surplus into a $400 billion deficit by the end of his first term, and a $1.2 trillion deficit by the end of his second term. Bush 41? No. Reagan? No. Ford? No. Nixon? No. The last Republican president who cut the deficit was Eisenhower. By the way, I'm sick of hearing the farcical line about Congress "controlling the purse strings." Any six-year-old child who's watched a Schoolhouse Rock cartoon knows the president signs all legislation before it becomes law, including appropriations bills. The House can't magically spend money without a presidential signature. Besides, if the president is to be blamed for the size of the deficit -- and the Republicans have been merciless on the president in this area in spite of reality, and their own party's record -- it's only fair that he should get credit when the deficit is reduced. Yet without objections, the Romney campaign and the Republicans continue to champion their status as "fiscal hawks" even though the facts prove that to correlate "fiscal responsibility" and "Republican Party" is absurd on its face. Even though Romney's plan for the deficit and the economy is as shifty, murky and ambiguous as he is, there appears to be nothing -- absolutely nothing -- about the Romney plan that's any different from every Republican presidential plan in recent history, but we're supposed to believe that Romney will cut the deficit anyway. In fact, as we all know by now, Romney is proposing $5 trillion in un-funded tax cuts, as well as massive increases in military spending, and, if Romney wins, you can bet the Republicans will jettison their deficit and debt hawkery into the next nearest memory hole to be forgotten until another Democrat enters the White House. If the Obama campaign and the Democrats can talk about the deficit in these terms, it undercuts one of the leading Republican attacks and becomes a winning issue for the president. Plus it helps to cement the reality of Mitt Romney The Pathological Liar.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349922919085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 22:35:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349927827844-64</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Krugman-Communist Economist</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349775214710</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 05:33:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>qbike, your momy is calling!</Msg><Username>bami2012</Username><Timestamp>1349927827844</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 23:57:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349927828065-65</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Krugman-Communist Economist</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1349775214710</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 05:33:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>qbike, your momy is calling!</Msg><Username>bami2012</Username><Timestamp>1349927828065</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 23:57:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
