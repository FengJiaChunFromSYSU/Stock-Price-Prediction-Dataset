One thing he knows now, he is not going to be held accountable for anything. It is all Bush's fault no matter what, because there will be always 51% of the public who believes this crap, it is now in mob's DNA. So, yes, he will throw few crumbs for the mob to pretend he is doing the best he can. But everything will come back later through another door. I don't even believe this guy even think a pile of debt he accumulated in the past 4 yerars is something negative. See, in 2008 $9.5T debt was "unpatriotic, irresponsible". $7T later - is nothing to worry about. The noise about debt/deficit is coming from pesky GOP, not from the White House. Get your parachute, this plane is still going to crash.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1355194162687</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 21:49:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
