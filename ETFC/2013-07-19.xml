Stand your ground is an affirmative defense which puts the burden of proof on the defendant, whereas allowing the state to charge him put the burden of proof on the state. If he'd have attempted a hearing under the stand your ground rules he might not have won it, but now with the acquittals a matter of record if he seeks it NOW, it's all but assured, and that will indemnify him from civil action.

You learn in the classes you take that warning shots unnecessarily endanger civilians, you shouldn't be chasing the threat anyway if it's retreating, hence no need to say "stop of I'll shoot" or any such other #$%$. A civilian with a CHL acting in a self defense state acts with sudden an unexpected lethal force to neutralize a threat to himself or others or in some cases to defend his property. You're SUPPOSED to try to avoid those situations, and they teach you to deescalate confrontations so that they stop well short of ANY force, but when you discharge a weapon in self defense in MOST Castle Law states that gun better be pointed at the person whom you consider the threat.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1374227439793</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 05:50:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374246583369-3</Id><Topic><Title>If the Right Wing Supports Zimmer ......</Title><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1374204488440</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 23:28:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So you admit to being racist.

Despite the fact that such laws were universally struck down by the Supreme Court's 2003 decision in Lawrence v. Texas, and that a federal appellate court recently rejected the state's appeal to keep the laws on the books, Cuccinelli has dug in his heels on the issue. The Republican's campaign recently launched a new website elaborating on the attorney general's unyielding support for the law. O'Donnell took the time to actually look at the language of Cuccinelli's favorite law, and discovered that the far-reaching policy would make a felony any kind of sex involving the #$%$ or the mouth of any citizen — male or female, straight, gay, or otherwise, married or single — and the "carnal parts" of another citizen. "In other words, it prohibits most gay and straight sex," explains O'Donnell. "And while it's at it, it prohibits sex with ‘any brute animal.’ In fact, the only sex act that remains legal is heterosexual vaginal intercourse. And don’t think you can enter marriage — it does not include an exception for married couples. So the republican candidate for governor in Virginia is running on a platform that wants to continue to make it illegal in Virginia for married couples to have oral sex. Or for any couples of any gender to have any form of oral sex."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1374253485418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:04:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374253795289-11</Id><Topic><Title>Southern States are Biggest Drain on Health Care</Title><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1374205166921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 23:39:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey ............behomo!

State legislators sold stand your ground as a legal protection for law-abiding Floridians who were forced, through no fault of their own, to defend their family and property. But the day Moorer killed his ex-wife's boyfriend in 2008 capped two years of violent behavior that had landed Moorer in jail multiple times and left his wife living in fear. Still, prosecutors set Moorer free, saying Florida's stand your ground law prevented them from pursuing murder charges. A Tampa Bay Times analysis of stand your ground cases found that it has been people like Moorer — those with records of crime and violence — who have benefited most from the controversial legislation. A review of arrest records for those involved in more than 100 fatal stand your ground cases shows: • Nearly 60 percent of those who claimed self-defense had been arrested at least once before the day they killed someone. • More than 30 of those defendants, about one in three, had been accused of violent crimes, including assault, battery or robbery. Dozens had drug offenses on their records. • Killers have invoked stand your ground even after repeated run-ins with the law. Forty percent had three arrests or more. Dozens had at least four arrests. • More than a third of the defendants had previously been in trouble for threatening someone with a gun or illegally carrying a weapon. • In dozens of cases, both the defendant and the victim had criminal records, sometimes related to long-running feuds or criminal enterprises. Of the victims that could be identified in state records, 64 percent had at least one arrest. Several had 20 or more arrests.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1374254270728</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:17:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374254316264-14</Id><Topic><Title>Are Conservatives Really This Ignorant About Racism?</Title><Username>manceridermunce</Username><Timestamp>1374094563974</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 16:56:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the killer says "he started it".... why - of course - he would not lie about that.... noooooo.....</Msg><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1374254316264</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:18:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374255545435-15</Id><Topic><Title>Are Conservatives Really This Ignorant About Racism?</Title><Username>manceridermunce</Username><Timestamp>1374094563974</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 16:56:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Pioneer Press: St. Paul, MN, Payne AVE - about 30 gang members of the HAM ("HOES AND MONEY") and the" WILD" get in a scuffle with each other.

None of them positive. Rachel Jeantel conceded Trayvon drew the first shot. Rachel told him to run. But "scared to death" Trayvon didn't want to run. He could just walk home. Instead he was staying for another 4 minutes looking for something. Looking for confrontation. Someone who sits on top beating another doesn't scream for help. Zimmerman didn't have to lie about that because there were witnesses. Zimmerman gave his testimony to police minutes after incident. Do you really believe it's possible to just make up the whole story with all little details in such a short time and not to make any conflicting statements? Impossible. There were no lies.

Facing $18.5 billion in long-term debt, Detroit is now turning to the federal courts for help, hardly matching the rosy portrait painted by the president in recent months. On the campaign trail, particularly in the Midwestern states dependent on the auto sector, Obama trumpeted his cash infusion to major American car companies as part of his populist pitch to blue-collar voters. “I wasn’t going to let Detroit go bankrupt.

Four years later, Billy Kuch got drunk, so drunk that at 5 a.m. one day he stumbled to the door of the wrong house in a look-alike neighborhood and tried to open it, twice. Before the "stand your ground" law, homeowner Gregory Stewart would have been expected to hunker down in his Land O'Lakes residence, dead-bolt secure, and call police. With the law in place, he could use deadly force anywhere he had a right to be, provided he felt threatened with death or great bodily harm. He had no duty to retreat from danger. Stewart left his wife inside with their baby and stepped outside, gun in hand. Kuch put his hands up and asked for a light. "Please don't make me shoot you," Stewart said. Kuch, then 23, says he might have stumbled. Stewart, then 32, told police the unarmed man took three steps forward. The bullet ripped into Kuch's chest, nicked his heart, shot through his liver, in and out of his stomach, through his spleen, then out his back. He felt like his body was on fire. Stewart, when questioned by deputies, began to cry. "I could have given him a light," he said. The days ticked by, Kuch in a coma as his parents waited for word of a trial. And waited. After two months, the Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney's Office decided the shooting was justified and dropped the aggravated battery charge. Kuch's parents couldn't believe it. "We're not against gun ownership," said Bill Kuch, 57 and retired from IBM. "But we're against this law that provides someone the right to kill you without prosecution." Billy Kuch spent more than a month in the hospital." Stewart is 6-1, 250.

The executive director of the Florida Coalition to Stop Gun Violence added another file to his growing stack. This shooting wasn't far from his own home. Hayhoe says the law turns Florida into the Wild West. "What in the hell is our state government doing passing a law encouraging our citizens to solve disputes with guns?" he said. "This is the right-to-commit-murder law." Florida was the first of more than 20 states to allow people to defend themselves with deadly force anywhere they had a right to be. Credit the National Rifle Association. Backed by the influential organization, the "stand your ground" legislation won broad support from lawmakers and praise from then-Gov. Jeb Bush as "a good, common-sense, anticrime issue." Marion Hammer, the NRA's Florida lobbyist, said the measure was needed to prevent authorities from harassing law-abiding people with unwarranted arrests. "The law was written very carefully and it means what it says: You have a right to protect yourself," she said. Drowned out in the debate were the critical voices of law enforcement officials and prosecutors. They worried people would become less sensitive to gun violence and death. They envisioned vigilantism. After the law took effect on Oct. 1, 2005, a national gun control group launched an ominous advertising campaign warning visitors about "Florida's Shoot First Law." Hayhoe passed out fliers at Miami International Airport telling tourists to "please take sensible precautions," such as: "Do not argue with local people." He wrote letters to the editor and started keeping tabs on cases where the new law was applied.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1374263759133</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:55:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374263895218-28</Id><Topic><Title>Stand your ground factoids</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1374254270728</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 13:17:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Times searched major Florida newspapers and found at least 93 cases in the past five years in which the new law was a factor. Those are just the confrontations that made the papers. In 57 of them, those who used force were either not charged with a crime or the charges were dropped by prosecutors or dismissed by a judge before trial. Seven other defendants were acquitted. Some people fought off intruders in their homes or businesses, which would have been allowed even before the "stand your ground" law. The use of force resulted in 65 deaths. Did the law empower the users of force to shoot? Could the tables have been turned on the shooters? If not for the law, would any of those 65 people still be alive? How can anyone know? What is known: Reports of justifiable homicides in Florida have spiked. For the first half of this decade, the state counted an average of 34 justifiable homicides a year, as few as 31 and as many as 43. That continued in 2006, the law's first full year. But the next three years brought these numbers: 2007: 102. 2008: 93. 2009: 105. The first six months of 2010: 44. "I have always predicted that they would increase as more and more gun owners learn what they can do with this law," Hayhoe said.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1374263895218</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:58:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374267864710-29</Id><Topic><Title>the moronic vigilante killer</Title><Username>manceridermunce</Username><Timestamp>1374263188950</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 15:46:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're not listening to useful advises.

Cognitive dissonance aside, the assertion of General George Armstrong Custer being a Marxist is an amazing thought experiment. I mean, who knew? Apparently Custer thought that the Cheyenne and Sioux nations were doing "Marxism" incorrectly. Custer thought he'd set them straight. Here's the deal: Someone voted for this GOP clown. In fact, enough people voted for this clown and agree with him and got him elected. He has fellow travelers. People that don't come with labels on their foreheads. They could be standing in line with you at the grocery store. You could be sitting next to one of them at a ball game or a movie theater. They are everywhere and until the GOP denounces them from the national level all the way down to municipalites and denies these racists a road to political power, simply assume that every single Republican voter and elected official is a racist, bigoted, Neo-Confederate theocrat that has one thing on their minds: Insurrection and civil war.

John Spooner, 76, was found guilty Wednesday of intentionally shooting and killing 13-year-old Darius Simmons. The trial then entered a second phase where the jury had to determine whether Spooner was in his right mind at the time of the killing. Thursday afternoon, a doctor found Spooner was competent to testify, at which time Spooner asked to take the stand in his own defense. Spooner said he killed the boy out of anger. He said he wanted to shoot the boy's older brother, but other people had gathered near him. "I wouldn't call it revenge. I would call it justice," Spooner said defiantly, drawing audible gasps from the courtroom. Darius' mother, Patricia Larry, threw up her hands and muttered, "Oh my God." A prosecutor asked if he felt bad about Darius Simmons. Spooner replied, "Not that bad."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1374275115416</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:05:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374275967563-45</Id><Topic><Title>Question for are armchair liberal</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1374173161504</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-18 14:46:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where is the BIG mouth coward?!

Pvt. Isaac Aguigui (AH-gee-gee) of Cashmere, Wash., pleaded guilty as part of a deal that spared him the death penalty on two counts of malice murder. He also pleaded guilty to four counts of violating Georgia’s anti-gang law. Prosecutors said Aguigui and three fellow Fort Stewart soldiers were part of a militia group called Forever Enduring Always Ready. The defendants were accused of fatally shooting a former member of their Army unit and the man’s 17-year-old girlfriend. Investigators say Aguigui ordered the deaths of Michael Roark and Tiffany York in 2011 to keep them from exposing the group’s plans. Isaac Aguigui, the Army private and alleged ringleader of a plot to assassinate Barack Obama and "take over" Ft. Stewart in Georgia, apparently served as a page at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis, Minn. That's his mug shot after he was arrested for the alleged murder of Pvt. Michael Roark on the left. At right is a 2008 Reuters photo with the caption: "Republican National Convention page Isaac Aguigui watches from the edge of the floor at the start of the first session of the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota September 1, 2008." Aguigui, according to Georgia prosecutors, financed a plot to kill the president, take over Ft. Stewart and poison apple orchards in Washington state with a $500,000 insurance settlement he got last year after his wife's death. The group—its numbers are unknown—called itself F.E.A.R., for Forever Enduring, Always Ready.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1374277156495</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-19 19:39:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374278717501-49</Id><Title>It Should Have Been Me</Title><Msg>As the biggest race-opportunist in the world, there is more blood on my hands than anyone can ever count.
