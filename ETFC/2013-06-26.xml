The decision to go forward with a measure that those federal judges called “the most stringent in the country" comes after the Supreme Court ruled that a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional. “With today’s decision, the State’s voter ID law will take effect immediately," Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said in a statement. "Redistricting maps passed by the Legislature may also take effect without approval from the federal government.” In blocking those redistricting maps last year, a separate panel of federal judges ruled that the government "provided more evidence of discriminatory intent than we have space, or need, to address" in their opinion. Attorney General Eric Holder cited the Texas redistricting case in his statement criticizing the Supreme Court's ruling. Texas Gov. Rick Perry signed into law the voter ID measure and redistricting maps in question. Abbott took to Twitter to celebrate the death of the Voting Rights Act provision:</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372222484745</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:54:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372222572750-5</Id><Title>Snowden Ain't No Hero</Title><Msg>HE IS A TRAITOR plain and simple!!! He was entrusted with some of the countries most sensitive secrets and he betrayed this trust. If you think any of this information is new you need help, our government has always had ways of finding out what they want to. The problem was none of the agencies talked to each other which is why 9/11 happened. I personally have nothing to hide so I don’t care!! if you have nothing to hide why should you care. I seriously doubt the NSA or CIA care about you’re conversations with your girlfriend or talking about how your boss is an #$%$ or even if you hate Obama. They are trying to find terrorists and yes we have them here. Now on the other side do I totally trust what some of these organizations do no because they have no oversight with what they do. The facts are secrets are needed and the public does not need to know about every secret or black program that exists . I could go on and on but it’s pointless I only touched on a few things in this rant . For the record I do know all to well of what I am saying I did my tour with the government for a number of year’s and held a high security clearance. I will always say that anyone doing this type of whistle blowing is a trator and should be treated as such. HE DAM SURE IS NOT A HERO.

Cuccinelli wants the court to reconsider a March 2013 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit striking down the state's "crimes against nature" statute. The 4th Circuit ruled that the law did not pass muster in light of the Supreme Court's 2003 Lawrence v. Texas decision, which struck down the latter state's anti-sodomy law as an unconstitutional criminalization of Americans' sexual conduct. The Virginia law, however, remained on the books. The 4th Circuit ruled in favor of William Scott McDonald, who was convicted in 2005 at age 47 under the Virginia statute for soliciting a 17-year-old girl to commit sodomy. That law broadly makes oral and anal sex a Class 6 felony. While such laws historically targeted gay men, they have also been used against heterosexual activity. The three-judge panel ruled that an unconstitutional law could not be used to convict McDonald. It added that the Virginia Legislature could pass another law to criminalize sexual conduct specifically between a minor and an adult. The Lawrence ruling applied only to consensual adult conduct.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1372254757336</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:52:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372254793294-13</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden Ain't No Hero</Title><Username>bypartisan305</Username><Timestamp>1372222572750</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:56:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More importantly he violated the Sacred Code of the Sysadmin . . . root access is not to be abused, or used to spy on one's employers, or to create networks within the network for private use without the bosses permission. Which, in this case, it's fairly safe to assume from all the documents he had to sign that he didn't have it, wouldn't get it, and they'd have been horrified to learn he was even READING the material except in the course of debugging, optimization, etc, having to do with system performance issues. Any disclosures he got were supposed to be of what we'd call the "incidental" kind, things he'd have to know to do his job, but didn't have full clearance for. Fortunately it's doubtful he breached the seriously secure portions of the network, but he certainly got well into the outer perimeter. I think what bothers the NSA most are questions as to what ELSE he might have done, as they fully are aware of what THEY could have done given the same access. Snowden no doubt has gigabytes of information he can neither read or decode stashed away somewhere waiting for a leap in quantum computing to help crack it. What he is releasing is what he read in the clear (lower classification level) or was told about. Who here really doubted the NSA wasn't t'ing all international router traffic to other servers for analysis? I mean that's just a given. That's they're ALSO monitoring the national backbone is surprising, but I guess once you have the computer power available to do it, it's just another extension of the same idea.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1372254793294</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 09:53:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372255008823-14</Id><Topic><Title>Snowden Ain't No Hero</Title><Username>bypartisan305</Username><Timestamp>1372222572750</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 00:56:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why, were you weeded out from 2001-2007?....... and besides as you ilk say.....the government is incompetent and my metadata is not only safe but I could not care less if some boob is listening in, after all...

Windsor, the DOMA case: The federal Defense of Marriage Act defines "marriage," for purposes of over a thousand federal laws and programs, as a union between a man and a woman only. Today the Court ruled, by a vote of five to four, in an opinion by Justice Kennedy, that the law is unconstitutional. The Court explained that the states have long had the responsibility of regulating and defining marriage, and some states have opted to allow same-sex couples to marry to give them the protection and dignity associated with marriage. By denying recognition to same-sex couples who are legally married, federal law discriminates against them to express disapproval of state-sanctioned same-sex marriage. This decision means that same-sex couples who are legally married must now be treated the same under federal law as married opposite-sex couples."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1372261911338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 11:51:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372262167144-33</Id><Topic><Title>Dems Win Again !</Title><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1372257315961</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 10:35:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah! like a liberal is not going to win any race in the great state of #$%$-achussets"</Msg><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1372262167144</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 11:56:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372264193956-34</Id><Title>Lots of accumulation so far this week, watch for</Title><Msg>A spike higher with month end window dressing</Msg><Username>pokerpro8222</Username><Timestamp>1372264193956</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 12:29:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372266016149-35</Id><Topic><Title>If Zimmerman wanted to kill the punk</Title><Username>josh_p_levine</Username><Timestamp>1372126839016</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-24 22:20:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lesson learned here, "inner city" gansta thuggary dont work in a gated community.</Msg><Username>jjovaz</Username><Timestamp>1372266016149</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 13:00:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372266756641-36</Id><Title>I can hear from MN across the state line.........</Title><Msg>............the liberals squealing about the change in the voting law - lead by Al Frankenstein, the comedian at large and his buddy Keith Ellison the liberal, ultra left, fearless Muslim leader, who want's to see a Somali/Muslim City with their own court built!

There is one witness in this case and he says he didn't confront Martin. To incriminate Zimmerman there must be undeniable proof he caused confrontation. So far, there is none.
