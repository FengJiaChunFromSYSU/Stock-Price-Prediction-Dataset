Dana Bash reported on this source, and the person's willingness to corroborate the allegation to which the Senate majority leader repeated on Thursday's airing of CNN's AC360. As Bash told the show's host, Anderson Cooper: I did speak to one source who is very close to Senator Reid who claims to also know who the Bain investor is that Reid spoke with, and insists that it is a credible person and this person if we knew the name we would understand they would have the authority and the ability to know about Romney's tax returns. "Whether we'll find it out ever," Bash added, "who knows? They're doing it on purpose, so this is the discussion." Indeed, in the days since the Huffington Post first reported on Reid's claim, Reid has done nothing to back down. The Romney camp on Thursday responded by insisting that Reid "put up or shut up." Reid, on the other hand, has made it clear that the burden of disproving his claim lies with Romney. This was reinforced in a statement from Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson, which Bash read on the air: "Senator Reid stands by his comments. Governor Romney's continued refusal to release his tax returns raises legitimate questions about what he is hiding and whether he paid any taxes at all. Governor Romney can easily end this debate by following the precedent set by his father and releasing tax returns." Bash offered her take on the matter, based on her years of covering Reid: There are times [Reid] says things off the cuff that make his aides wince, like talking about smelly tourists in the Capitol -- I'm not making this up. This is not one of those times. This is one of those times he knows exactly what he's doing. He's doing it on purpose, he is doing it for political reasons, because he wants this issue -- Romney's taxes -- talked about on programs like yours, wants it to be headlines in newspapers and wants Mitt Romney to respond on this issue which they think is a negative for Romney, as opposed to issues Romney wants to talk about. Bash called Reid's decision to get into this fight to be "very personal" and "very Harry Reid." "When Harry Reid doesn't like somebody, he goes for the jugular." So to recap: Dana Bash's anonymous source says Harry Reid's anonymous source is right, and it's yet to occur to Romney that he could easily end all of this and claim Harry Reid's scalp just by releasing his tax returns."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344003968000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 10:26:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344004124000-22</Id><Topic><Title>Taxing Medalists????</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1343923860000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 12:11:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have it right.

According to CNN, today Karl Rove and Romney's Adviser, Ed Gillespie, are illegally coordinating campaign strategy at a Policy Briefing in Colorado. CNN: August 2, 2012 (Thursday): Aspen, Colorado (CNN) – Despite laws barring coordination between federal campaigns and outside groups, Karl Rove and [Paid Romney Adviser] Ed Gillespie are hosting a joint closed-door political briefing with leading Republican donors Thursday. According to Republicans familiar with the schedule, the two operatives are headlining a lunchtime political briefing for top donors at the Republican Governors Association meeting in Aspen, a posh, closed-press affair where GOP governors mingle with some of their biggest financial backers. Let's not forget, the head of Romney's Campaign in Arizona is Secretary of State, Ken Bennett, fought desperately to bar President Obama from being on the Arizona Ballot in November. Let's also not forget that Karl Rove is an un-indicted criminal. Oh, but get this, Romney admits he knows he is breaking Federal Laws by coordinating with Karl Rove. December 2011: ROMNEY: "Super PACs have to be entirely separate from a campaign and a candidate. I'm not allowed to communicate with a super PAC in any way, shape or form. If we coordinate in any way whatsoever, we go to the big house." Mitt Romney will break laws, lie and cheat to become President -- the only things Romney won't do to become President is: release 10 years of taxes, release details on his Tax Policy, release details on his Foreign Policy, Release names of his Bundlers, Release names on his secret Energy Commission, release details on his Health Plan ideas" hat tip to Zeke Miller at buzzfeed</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1344009059000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 11:50:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344009599000-38</Id><Title>IIMO, KNight had something to do with yesterday's dump</Title><Msg>Freeing up assets, whatever.

The author can do anything he wants with his own book. If I am not interested in it, I simply let it stand on the shelf. The law of the land is something you have to live with. b. Changing a chapter in the book may or may not need full revision depending on what chapter is all about and its linkage to other chapters. When you debate the law of the land all components must be in place. In case of Obamacare we were not talking about couple of chapters change. The large part of the document wasn't available up until couple of days before the vote took place. So, what was Pelosi taking about? Couple of letters change on page 1378?

You have to have ESTATE worth millions to be taxed ESTATE TAX, and most of those folks find ways to offload the wealth to their children ahead. The ESTATE TAX really affects only either the ultra-rich that simply died unexpectedly without making prior arrangements, had so much crap that they run out of time to transfer the assets tax free, or the "unsuspecting" beneficiaries that are NOT tax exempt organizations.

"If I don’t have this done in three years, then there’s going to be a one-term proposition.” Team Obama said in ’09 stimulus would have unemployment below 6% by 2012 Today’s news that the unemployment rate moved up to 8.3 percent is as good of a time as time as any to revisit the promises the then-incoming administration made in 2009 regarding the economic stimulus bill. Back then they said the stimulus would have unemployment below 6 percent by now. Not only that but they claimed that the unemployment would be at that 6 percent level now even if the stimulus bill was not passed. That is, that they predicted the economy would recover to that level naturally. In short, the White Houses projections regarding stimulus and the economy were wildly off. The report, entitled “The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan,” was released on Jan. 9, 2009. It was put out by the office of the president-elect was written by economists Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein. Romer would become chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Obama. Bernstein was Vice President Biden’s chief economic advisor. Page four of the report features a chart projecting the unemployment levels with and without the stimulus. With the stimulus, the Romer and Bernstein predicted that unemployment would never rise past 8 percent, and would peak just under that in the third quarter of 2009 before steadily declining to around 5.6 percent by today. Without the stimulus, they predicted that unemployment would peak around 9 percent in the third quarter of 2010 before declining to around 6 percent today.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344024433000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 16:07:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>18</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344024782000-79</Id><Topic><Title>unemoloyment below 6% by 2012</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344024433000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 16:07:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gop doesn't care about jobs, they hate working people,Mittens has fired lots of people and lots got fired when bain raped their companies. the gop mindless tantrum over the debt crisis cost hundreds of thousands of jobs, the price of their grandstanding: 2011 feb........220,000 jobs added mar......246,000 jobs apr........251,000 GOP BEGINS ITS SABOTAGE over the debt ceiling, threatening default. may..... less than 100K jobs added june...less than 100K july...less than 100K august... less than 100K jobs added debt ceiling resolved SEP OVER 200,000 JOBS ADDED nice work gop !

The report by the centrist Tax Policy Center found that Romney's tax cuts would boost after-tax income by an average of 4.1 percent for those earning more than $1 million a year, while reducing by an average of 1.2 percent the after-tax income of individuals earning less than $200,000. Tax policy and how to tame the U.S. government's budget deficit, topping $1 trillion in recent years, is a major point of contrast in the presidential race, in which Romney will face President Barack Obama on Nov. 6. Romney, a multi-millionaire who made his fortune at private equity firm Bain Capital, has not spelled out how he would lower marginal tax rates. But he has said broadly he would cut some tax benefits for the wealthy. Because the value of the 20 percent tax cut for richer Americans would exceed the gains they get from popular tax breaks that Romney would chop, they would see the greatest income gain from Romney's possible changes, the study said. "We add up how much people get from the tax cuts and then add up how much can be potentially be raised," from ending tax breaks, said Adam Looney, an economist and one of the study's authors. About two-thirds of the $1.1 trillion in revenues that the government foregoes annually because of tax breaks would have to be curbed to fund Romney's tax cut, the analysts said. These tax breaks include popular ones such as the mortgage interest deduction, the break for employer-provided health insurance, and credits for low- and middle-income families. The analysis assumed elimination of tax breaks would start with the wealthy as Romney has suggested, and it assumed some revenue growth from lower tax rates, a hallmark of Republican tax policy. Obama has blasted Romney's tax plan for disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. The tax policy debate is expected to intensify at the end of 2012, with the expiration of lower tax rates for all Americans enacted under Republican President George W. Bush. The Democratic-led Senate last week passed legislation extending most of those tax rates - but not for households earning more than $250,000 a year. The Republican-led House of Representatives will likely pass their plan to extend the current rates some time this week. The dispute is not likely to be resolved until after the elections. Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg said she could not respond to the center's report without reading it first. Romney's tax proposal also includes cutting some taxes on investment income and eliminating taxes on estates passed on to heirs.

Vacant Detroit becomes dumping ground for the dead DETROIT (AP) -- Abandoned and neglected parts of Detroit are quickly becoming dumping grounds for the bodies of murder victims. And authorities acknowledge there's little they can do. At least a dozen bodies have turned up in 12 months, many of them purposely hidden or discarded in alleys, fields and vacant houses or garages. Seven of the dead are believed to have been slain outside Detroit and then dumped within the city. It's a pattern made possible by more than four decades of urban decay and suburban flight. Many parts of the city are now a vast urban wilderness that is rarely visited by outsiders and infrequently patrolled by police. Officer John Garner says a slaying may go unsolved because of the time it takes for the corpse to be found.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344029388000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 17:29:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>12</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344029631000-101</Id><Topic><Title>GABBY DOUGLAS!</Title><Username>rowdyrodent_1995</Username><Timestamp>1344019976000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 14:52:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was reading a report on the 3 guys who died while shielding their girlfriends during the Aurora CO shooting.

Their report revealed a huge discrepancy in the Senate and House Bill... namely, the exemption of spouses and dependent children. The CNN report revealed that the Senate bill did include a provision that covered spouses and children, "but when Cantor's office wrote the House version, this language was shifted to a different section of the bill." Spouses and dependent children were exempted from the House's new reporting requirements. When CNN first came across this discrepancy in the Senate and House versions, Cantor's office claimed "it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act. But when pressed with the new information uncovered by CNN, the majority leader's office conceded it made changes to the House bill that effectively took out the requirement for spouses and children to file these reports." Finally, once they knew they were caught, Cantor's office acted like CNN hadn't written down their first answer by saying: "Since new information has been brought to our attention with respect to this discrepancy, we are reviewing our options regarding transaction reports in the House of Representatives." How could this information be "new" to Cantor? He was the one who changed it and moved it to a different section of the bill. Cantor's office also told CNN they hadn't figured out when or how to fix it. He's Majority Leader, and he doesn't know when or how? The truth is he could fix it today if he wanted to. He called for 33 different votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and he can't call for a way to eliminate the "spousal and dependent children exemption" from the House version of the STOCK Act?

Not sure what's more pathetic, your ignorance, your spelling or your inclination to lie. From politifact: "Projection vs. promise First, we have never found an instance of anyone in the administration making a public pledge to keep unemployment below 8 percent. The source for Romney’s and the others’ statements is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. Their report projected that the stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. The important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn’t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart that states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action." Our ruling Romney didn't use the word "promise" as Boehner, Cantor and others did when we checked the same claim previously, but the meaning is the same, that Obama was offering some sort of guarantee the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." In short, it was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344038563000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 20:02:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344039261000-118</Id><Title>Simon says "income" taxes ??</Title><Msg>An interesting theory on the Wimp's tax problem: by David Zephyr Romney's Un-Artful Tax Dodge Purposely Omits the Word "Income" in His Statement The standing accusation from Senator Reid (now being corroborated by Dana Bash) is that Mitt Romney did not pay "income taxes" for ten years. Today, the most rehearsed and well-scripted candidate in American political history, Mitt Romney, responded (again) to the charge with these carefully chosen words: “Let me also say, categorically, I have paid taxes every year. And a lot of taxes," candidate Romney declared. Well, EVERYONE pays "taxes every year". We all pay sales taxes and gasoline taxes. Romney did NOT say he has paid INCOME "taxes every year". Very revealing. Not an accident. He left the words "income" out of his denial. On purpose. By design. This guy is sweating like Nixon on this issue and is clearly hiding what he knows would appall Americans of all stripes. "I have paid taxes every year." Yeah, Mitt. So has everyone in America.

Romney’s most recent financial disclosure form revealed that his tax-deferred individual retirement account holds upwards of $100 million — an amount that awkwardly showcases his enormous wealth but also raises legal and ethical questions. IRAs are intended to allow workers to put away modest sums of money each year in order to help finance a middle class retirement. The savings are tax deferred, but there’s a legal limit — now $6,000 — on how much each IRA holder can contribute annually. Now top Democrats on the Budget, Ways and Means, and Education and Workforce Committees want to know how people of Romney’s wealth can end up with 100,000 times that much money in a single IRA, and how much the tax and investment strategies they employ cost the Treasury in revenue every year. In a letter Thursday to senior officials at the Treasury and Labor departments, Reps. George Miller (D-CA), Sander Levin (D-MI), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) want to know: Is this legal? How easy is this strategy to get away with? How much does it cost the government every year? And what can be done to end the practice?</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344043537000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 21:25:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344043991000-125</Id><Title>Romney is a Mormon Dubya</Title><Msg>Both are known as 'wimps' Both were cheerleaders, not players Both were born into great wealth and notoriety And both, were draft dodgers Dubya was sent to a "safe" Guard unit, and suffered massive coke and booze Purple Hearts And Mittens ........ "Romney had missed much of the tumultuous American anti-Vietnam War movement while away and was surprised to learn that his father had turned against the effort during his unsuccessful 1968 presidential campaign.[33] Regarding the military draft, Romney had initially received two 2-S student deferments, then, like most Mormon missionaries, a 4-D ministerial deferment while in France, and then two more student deferments.[29][49] When those ran out, his high number in the December 1969 draft lottery (300) ensured that he would not be selected.[29][49][50]" ......................

As I said before, I was told by an extremely credible source that Romney has not paid taxes for ten years. People who make as much money as Mitt Romney have many tricks at their disposal to avoid paying taxes. We already know that Romney has exploited many of these loopholes, stashing his money in secret, overseas accounts in places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. “Last weekend, Governor Romney promised that he would check his tax returns and let the American people know whether he ever paid a rate lower than 13.9 percent. One day later, his campaign raced to say he had no intention of putting out any further information. “When it comes to answering the legitimate questions the American people have about whether he avoided paying his fair share in taxes or why he opened a Swiss bank account, Romney has shut up. But as a presidential candidate, it’s his obligation to put up, and release several years’ worth of tax returns just like nominees of both parties have done for decades. “It’s clear Romney is hiding something, and the American people deserve to know what it is. Whatever Romney’s hiding probably speaks volumes about how he would approach issues that directly impact middle-class families, like tax reform and the economy. When you are running for president, you should be an open book. “I understand Romney is concerned that many people, Democrats and Republicans, have been calling on him to release his tax returns. He has so far refused. There is only one thing he can do to clear this up, and that’s release his tax returns.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1344044573000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 21:42:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>19</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344045021000-127</Id><Topic><Title>unemoloyment below 6% by 2012</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1344024433000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 16:07:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;&lt;Whoops! 8.3% and climbing&gt;&gt; Obviously he assumed a DEMOCRATIC controlled house when he made that promise....</Msg><Username>crown_11111</Username><Timestamp>1344045021000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 21:50:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>20</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344045472000-128</Id><Title>Failifornia may have to de-friend Suckerberg</Title><Msg>Expected Pie in the sky revenues turn out to be pie in the FACE- -book revs for failifornia.
