Who are you quoting now? Where is the proof of such accumulated "surplus"? "TAKE AWAY IDIOTIC WAR IN IRAQ AND SS IS SOLVENT" Now you are saying SS is not solvent? And that's a good excuse to under fund it in our days! "the federal government has borrowed all of that trust fund money and spent it" That sounds like conspiracy theory. Never heard of that before. Put your quotation marks to where they belong - trash. With Iraq war or without SS would have exact same amount of money.

Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for finally admitting on national television that all the fiscal cliffs, sequestrations and budget battles you’ve created are, indeed, artificially fabricated by ideologues and self-interested politicians and not the result of some imminent crisis that’s out of our control. America owes this debt of gratitude to Boehner after he finally came clean on yesterday’s edition of ABC’s “This Week” and admitted that “we do not have an immediate debt crisis.” (His admission was followed up by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who quickly echoed much the same sentiment on CBS’ Face the Nation). In offering up such a stunningly honest admission, the GOP leader has put himself on record as agreeing with President Obama, who has previously acknowledged that demonstrable reality. But the big news here isn’t just about the politics of a Republican House Speaker tacitly admitting they agree with a Democratic president. It is also about a bigger admission revealing the fact that the GOP’s fiscal alarmism is not merely some natural reaction to reality, but a calculated means to other ideological ends. Before considering those ends, first remember that Boehner (like Obama) is correct on the facts. As Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman has pointed out, “Even if we do run deficits, federal debt as a share of GDP will be substantially less than it was at the end of World War II” and “it will also be substantially less than, say, debt in several European countries in the mid to late 1990s.” It is also lower than the 80 percent of GDP level that many economists say starts to put countries in a precarious position.

If we could somehow do that, then there would be plenty of gradual steps that could be taken right now – steps that deal with the debt in measured ways that do the least harm to the overall economy. Those include starting to phase out the Bush tax cuts, which show no correlation with job growth and yet are the single largest driver of annual deficits; starting to reduce defense and war spending, which, job-creation-wise, is one of the least effective ways for the government to spend money; starting to move the United States toward the lest costly, more efficient, and more effective single-payer health care system that most industrialized countries have, and that lowers overhead for employers; and starting to spend more money on social programs that fight economic inequality, with the understanding that driving down such inequality tends to boost macroeconomic growth and consequently boost public revenues (this is the Reagan-esque idea of growing one’s way out of debt)."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363618208265</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 10:50:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363618848674-16</Id><Title>Entitlements the GOP never mentions</Title><Msg>March 16, 2013 The Real Spending Problem By THE NYT EDITORIAL BOARD The budget fight in Washington, which entered a new round last week as Senate Democrats and House Republicans introduced dueling plans, is usually cast as a contest between raising taxes and cutting spending. In fact, the taxes-versus-spending distinction is largely meaningless. Each year, the government doles out tax breaks worth $1.1 trillion. That is more than the cost of Medicare and Medicaid combined. It is more than Social Security. It tops the defense budget, and it tops the budget for nondefense discretionary programs, which include most everything else. Tax breaks work like spending. Giving a deduction for certain activities, like homeownership or retirement savings, is the same as writing a government check to subsidize those activities. Functionally, they mimic entitlements. Like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, they are available, year in and year out, in full, to all who qualify. Yet in budget talks, Republicans ignore tax entitlements, which flow mostly to high-income taxpayers, while pushing to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. President Obama and Congressional Democrats have rightly asserted that tax breaks are ripe for cuts that could raise revenue without hurting most taxpayers. One method, as presented in the Senate Democratic plan, is to convert tax deductions, which increase in value as income rises, to tax credits, which would provide benefits more broadly and evenly among low-, middle- and high-income households.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363618848674</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:00:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363618979023-17</Id><Topic><Title>Entitlements the GOP never mentions</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363618848674</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:00:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tax deductions, however, are only one kind of tax break. Many others take the form of arrangements that allow wealthy taxpayers to either escape tax entirely on specific transactions or to defer it indefinitely. Democratic budget proposals have targeted some tax shelters. They all bear scrutiny. Especially now, when solutions are needed to replace the automatic budget cuts, many tactics are indefensible and should be ended, including: CARRIED INTEREST This loophole lets private equity partners pay tax on most of their income at a top rate of 20 percent, versus a top rate of 39.6 percent for other high-income professionals. It drains the Treasury of $13.4 billion a decade, and should be closed, along with a shelter recently enacted in Puerto Rico that would help shield the income of individuals whose taxes would rise if the carried-interest tax break was eliminated. NINE-FIGURE I.R.A.’S Remember Mitt Romney’s $100 million I.R.A? Private equity partners apparently build up vast tax-deferred accounts by claiming that the equity interests transferred to such accounts from, say, their firms’ buyout targets are not worth much. No one knows how much tax is avoided this way. What is known is that I.R.A.’s are meant to help build retirement nest eggs, not to help amass huge estates to pass on to heirs.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363618979023</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:02:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363619042135-18</Id><Topic><Title>Entitlements the GOP never mentions</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363618848674</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:00:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>‘LIKE KIND’ EXCHANGES As reported in The Times by David Kocieniewski, this tax break was enacted some 90 years ago to help farmers sell land and horses without owing tax, as long as they used the proceeds to buy new farm assets. Today, it is used by wealthy individuals and big companies to avoid tax on the sale of art, vacation homes, rental properties, oil wells, commercial real estate and thoroughbred horses, among other transactions. Government estimates say this costs about $3 billion a year, but industry data suggest the amount could be far higher. The list goes on. American multinationals, insurance companies and so-called S corporations are tax avoidance machines. What remains of the estate tax is beset with tax dodges. Even golf courses are entitled to a special tax break of their own: some $50 million a year is granted to owners who donate golf courses to conservation trusts, ostensibly to benefit the public — though the public good in private courses is dubious. In this time of ill-advised budget cuts, there are surely better ways to spend that money. For $50 million, 6,000 children could attend Head Start next year.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363619042135</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:04:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363619914788-19</Id><Topic><Title>Entitlements the GOP never mentions</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363618848674</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:00:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Functionally, they mimic entitlements. " Fascinating, what don't you discuss the difference between earned and unearned entitlements? No? Do you know what it is? Certainly the NYT doesn't want you do know, but maybe you can find out on your own with a little research. Homeownership is more stable, so the government incentivizes it, same with retirement savings, because a person that owns their own home and HAS retirement savings is far less likely to become dependent on unearned entitlements later, thus costing the government far more than those earned entitlements you've been treating like welfare transfer payments within your social morality.

In fact, the taxes-versus-spending distinction is largely meaningless. Each year, the government doles out tax breaks worth $1.1 trillion. That is more than the cost of Medicare and Medicaid combined. It is more than Social Security. It tops the defense budget, and it tops the budget for nondefense discretionary programs, which include most everything else. Tax breaks work like spending. Giving a deduction for certain activities, like homeownership or retirement savings, is the same as writing a government check to subsidize those activities. Functionally, they mimic entitlements. Like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, they are available, year in and year out, in full, to all who qualify. Yet in budget talks, Republicans ignore tax entitlements, which flow mostly to high-income taxpayers, while pushing to cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. President Obama and Congressional Democrats have rightly asserted that tax breaks are ripe for cuts that could raise revenue without hurting most taxpayers. One method, as presented in the Senate Democratic plan, is to convert tax deductions, which increase in value as income rises, to tax credits, which would provide benefits more broadly and evenly among low-, middle- and high-income households.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363639664364</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 16:47:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363639717726-45</Id><Topic><Title>Welfare for the well to do</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363639664364</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 16:47:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tax deductions, however, are only one kind of tax break. Many others take the form of arrangements that allow wealthy taxpayers to either escape tax entirely on specific transactions or to defer it indefinitely. Democratic budget proposals have targeted some tax shelters. They all bear scrutiny. Especially now, when solutions are needed to replace the automatic budget cuts, many tactics are indefensible and should be ended, including: CARRIED INTEREST This loophole lets private equity partners pay tax on most of their income at a top rate of 20 percent, versus a top rate of 39.6 percent for other high-income professionals. It drains the Treasury of $13.4 billion a decade, and should be closed, along with a shelter recently enacted in Puerto Rico that would help shield the income of individuals whose taxes would rise if the carried-interest tax break was eliminated. NINE-FIGURE I.R.A.’S Remember Mitt Romney’s $100 million I.R.A? Private equity partners apparently build up vast tax-deferred accounts by claiming that the equity interests transferred to such accounts from, say, their firms’ buyout targets are not worth much. No one knows how much tax is avoided this way. What is known is that I.R.A.’s are meant to help build retirement nest eggs, not to help amass huge estates to pass on to heirs</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363639717726</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 16:48:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363639808338-46</Id><Topic><Title>Welfare for the well to do</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363639664364</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 16:47:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>‘LIKE KIND’ EXCHANGES As reported in The Times by David Kocieniewski, this tax break was enacted some 90 years ago to help farmers sell land and horses without owing tax, as long as they used the proceeds to buy new farm assets. Today, it is used by wealthy individuals and big companies to avoid tax on the sale of art, vacation homes, rental properties, oil wells, commercial real estate and thoroughbred horses, among other transactions. Government estimates say this costs about $3 billion a year, but industry data suggest the amount could be far higher. The list goes on. American multinationals, insurance companies and so-called S corporations are tax avoidance machines. What remains of the estate tax is beset with tax dodges. Even golf courses are entitled to a special tax break of their own: some $50 million a year is granted to owners who donate golf courses to conservation trusts, ostensibly to benefit the public — though the public good in private courses is dubious. In this time of ill-advised budget cuts, there are surely better ways to spend that money. For $50 million, 6,000 children could attend Head Start next year.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363639808338</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 16:50:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363640278455-47</Id><Topic><Title>LQQK= 13 Indicator ETFC Research Report =LQQK</Title><Username>marcoblynk</Username><Timestamp>1363428509515</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 06:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good</Msg><Username>broucebounce</Username><Timestamp>1363640278455</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 16:57:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363641234256-48</Id><Topic><Title>The Ryan Plan: Cutting Benefits For Poor Women To Protect Millionaires</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1363357690294</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-15 10:28:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one, including US President, can take a penny from SS without special provision of legislative branch.

Fifty-eight percent of Americans now say it should be legal for gay and lesbian couples to wed. That number has grown sharply in ABC News/Washington Post polls, from a low of 32 percent in a 2004 survey of registered voters, advancing to a narrow majority for the first time only two years ago, and now up again to a significant majority for the first time. Most Americans, moreover, say the U.S. Constitution should trump state laws on gay marriage, a question now before the U.S. Supreme Court. And – in another fundamental shift – just 24 percent now see homosexuality as a choice, down from 40 percent nearly 20 years ago. It’s a view that closely relates to opinions on the legality of same-sex marriage. Intensity of sentiment about gay marriage also shows considerable change in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates. In 2004, strong opponents outnumbered strong supporters by a broad 34 percentage points. Today strong supporters are ascendant, outnumbering strong opponents by 11 points.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363652212540</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 20:16:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363652424653-61</Id><Title>Boehner now admits no debt "crisis"!!</Title><Msg>by David Sirota "I never thought I’d write these words, but here goes: thank you, John Boehner. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for finally admitting on national television that all the fiscal cliffs, sequestrations and budget battles you’ve created are, indeed, artificially fabricated by ideologues and self-interested politicians and not the result of some imminent crisis that’s out of our control. America owes this debt of gratitude to Boehner after he finally came clean on yesterday’s edition of ABC’s “This Week” and admitted that “we do not have an immediate debt crisis.” (His admission was followed up by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, who quickly echoed much the same sentiment on CBS’ Face the Nation). In offering up such a stunningly honest admission, the GOP leader has put himself on record as agreeing with President Obama, who has previously acknowledged that demonstrable reality. But the big news here isn’t just about the politics of a Republican House Speaker tacitly admitting they agree with a Democratic president. It is also about a bigger admission revealing the fact that the GOP’s fiscal alarmism is not merely some natural reaction to reality, but a calculated means to other ideological ends. Before considering those ends, first remember that Boehner (like Obama) is correct on the facts. As Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman has pointed out, “Even if we do run deficits, federal debt as a share of GDP will be substantially less than it was at the end of World War II” and “it will also be substantially less than, say, debt in several European countries in the mid to late 1990s.” It is also lower than the 80 percent of GDP level that many economists say starts to put countries in a precarious position.

If we could somehow do that, then there would be plenty of gradual steps that could be taken right now – steps that deal with the debt in measured ways that do the least harm to the overall economy. Those include starting to phase out the Bush tax cuts, which show no correlation with job growth and yet are the single largest driver of annual deficits; starting to reduce defense and war spending, which, job-creation-wise, is one of the least effective ways for the government to spend money; starting to move the United States toward the lest costly, more efficient, and more effective single-payer health care system that most industrialized countries have, and that lowers overhead for employers; and starting to spend more money on social programs that fight economic inequality, with the understanding that driving down such inequality tends to boost macroeconomic growth and consequently boost public revenues (this is the Reagan-esque idea of growing one’s way out of debt)."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363652482869</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 20:21:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363653053192-63</Id><Topic><Title>hold on to your panties, Ronald Reagan was out to get your guns!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1363641297062</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 17:14:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>really limbots, you say there can be no laws to infringe on the "rights" of the insane to 'bear arms"? convicted felons on parole?.....your right to own a rocket launcher???

Among the revelations - he planned a dramatic entry into the 1968 Democratic Convention to re-join the presidential race. And he caught Richard Nixon sabotaging the Vietnam peace talks... but said nothing. After the Watergate scandal taught Richard Nixon the consequences of recording White House conversations none of his successors has dared to do it. But Nixon wasn't the first. He got the idea from his predecessor Lyndon Johnson, who felt there was an obligation to allow historians to eventually eavesdrop on his presidency. "They will provide history with the bark off," Johnson told his wife, Lady Bird.

By the late 1960s Americans had been involved in the the Vietnam War for nearly a decade, and the ongoing conflict was an incredibly contentious issue, says PBS: In 1967, with American troop strength in Vietnam reaching 500,000, protest against U.S. participation in the Vietnam War had grown stronger as growing numbers of Americans questioned whether the U.S. war effort could succeed or was morally justifiable. They took their protests to the streets in peace marches, demonstrations, and acts of civil disobedience. Despite the country’s polarization, the balance of American public opinion was beginning to sway toward “de-escalation” of the war. Nixon’s Presidental campaign needed the war to continue, since Nixon was running on a platform that opposed the war. The BBC: Nixon feared a breakthrough at the Paris Peace talks designed to find a negotiated settlement to the Vietnam war, and he knew this would derail his campaign.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1363656159184</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 21:22:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363656280809-69</Id><Topic><Title>22k Americans died in Vietnam post Nixon treason</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1363656159184</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 21:22:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>… In late October 1968 there were major concessions from Hanoi which promised to allow meaningful talks to get underway in Paris – concessions that would justify [President Lyndon] Johnson calling for a complete bombing halt of North Vietnam. This was exactly what Nixon feared. President Johnson had at the time a habit of recording all of his phone conversations, and newly released tapes from 1968 detailed that the FBI had “bugged” the telephones of the South Vietnamese ambassador and of Anna Chennault, one of Nixon’s aides. Based on the tapes, says Taylor for the BBC, we learn that in the time leading up to the Paris Peace talks, “Chennault was despatched to the South Vietnamese embassy with a clear message: the South Vietnamese government should withdraw from the talks, refuse to deal with Johnson, and if Nixon was elected, they would get a much better deal.” The Atlantic Wire: In the recently released tapes, we can hear Johnson being told about Nixon’s interference by Defence Secretary Clark Clifford. The FBI had bugged the South Vietnamese ambassadors phone. They had Chennault lobbying the ambassador on tape. Johnson was justifiably furious — he ordered Nixon’s campaign be placed under FBI surveillance. Johnson passed along a note to Nixon that he knew about the move. Nixon played like he had no idea why the South backed out, and offered to travel to Saigon to get them back to the negotiating table.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1363656280809</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 21:24:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363658892915-70</Id><Topic><Title>Top Analyst UPGRADES ETFC</Title><Username>browndrake513</Username><Timestamp>1363270784976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:19:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great</Msg><Username>haviernorris</Username><Timestamp>1363658892915</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 22:08:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363662128224-71</Id><Topic><Title>"Scary", "Narrow-Minded", "Out of Touch "</Title><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1363622341539</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-18 11:59:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!
