Over the past 50 years, as tax rates have declined, there has been no increase in investment spending as a percentage of GDP. (The flat trend line shows that changes in the highest marginal income-tax rate have not affected investment much, one way or the other.) Instead, the investment share of the economy has been determined by other factors, such as aggregate demand, rather than tax policy Lower Taxes, Slower GDP Growth: Despite lower and declining tax rates, especially on the rich, the United States has had slower productivity growth over the last several decades than other advanced economies. Overall, lower taxes are associated with slower growth in GDP per hour worked.

GDP is a measure of revenue, not profit. When taxes are high, you have more incentive to buy stuff that you can write-off as part of a business expense since it costs you less in profit. If a new piece of equipment costs 1000$ and your tax rate is 0, that 1000$ comes straight out of your bottom line. If your tax rate is 50% though, that new equipment is only costing you 500$ out of your bottom line.

Not to mention opportunity. That’s right. America has become the country with the least equality of opportunity of any of the advanced industrial countries.

What’s behind this trend? “Probably the most important reason for lack of equality of opportunity is education: both its quantity and quality,” writes Stiglitz, an economics professor at Columbia University. The rising inequality in income distribution has led to a widening education gap, Stiglitz notes. The educational achievement gap between rich and poor children born in 2001 was 30 to 40 percent larger than for those born 25 years earlier, according to Stanford sociologist Sean Reardon. Stiglitz’ solutions: • Ensure mothers aren’t exposed to environmental hazards and receive necessary prenatal care. • “Reverse the damaging cutbacks to preschool education.” • Provide proper nutrition and healthcare to children. • Give more money to poor schools. • Make higher education more accessible to the poor and middle class. One element of the equality issue that now occupies center stage is the minimum wage.

Debt-To-GDP Nonsense The latest fad in Washington economic policy debates is arguing over the level at which the government should stabilise the debt-to-GDP ratio. The doves are okay with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 73 percent or even 76 percent. The hawks want 60 percent or even less. This is the most fun since the same crew was debating over the year when we would pay off the national debt back in 2000. The good times just keep coming. If you think that this is an incredibly silly debate and that our leading policymakers don't have a clue about how the economy works, you've got the picture right. Remember, these are people who could not see the $8 trillion housing bubble whose collapse wrecked the economy. They haven't learned much economics in the last five years. The argument over the debt-to-GDP ratio is especially annoying because it shows that these people don't have the faintest clue what they are talking about. There are all sorts of obvious reasons why debt is not a good measure of the burden that we are placing on future taxpayers. For example, the government has a huge amount of assets that it could sell at any time and thereby reduce its debt. The Institute for Energy Research, an industry-funded research outfit, claims the government owns more than $120 trillion in energy resources. Let's say they exaggerated by a factor of 10, leaving us $12 trillion in assets. If we sold off half of these resources, it would net the government $6 trillion. This would reduce our debt by almost 40 percentage points of GDP. That should make even the most ardent deficit hawk happy........

In short 4 years of same spending rates and we'll need 75 years to pay off debt. Half of that time is to pay what this president accumulated. Obama may be RIP but his debt alive! What a legacy he is building for himself! Knuckleheads think this kind of punitive policy is not going to be disincentive for anyone to work hard and achieve. Well, they never learn. Can't wait Obama proposing that to see how many idiots like you would cheer up this idea.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1362953026550</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 18:03:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362953294564-26</Id><Topic><Title>phony pubs worry about how much taxes the poor &amp; barely getting by bottom 50% pay</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1362936949459</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 13:35:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Defense spending is Keynesian?

YOU are the one whining that the the bottom half should pay more... and they only take in 10% or so of all income......so, get a brain, and if YOU are worried about PAYING OFF the debt (a stupid idea , the bigger debt/gdp of WW2 was never paid off), but if YOU want to pay it off OBVIOUSLY taxes have to be raised on those WITH the money.... and 1% take in 20% of ALL usa AGI, or about $1.8 trillion..... the top 10% take in about half of all USA AGI about about 4.5 trillion...............but YOU whine about the bottom half, the 70 million who take in less than 1 trillion......jeez... see how warped you are? gop wants, what , 100 billion of deficit reduction each year? ok.. top 1% take in $1.8 trillion.. so a tax hike on just the 1% of 5.5% covers ALL that the gop wants for deficit reduction.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1362954482084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-10 18:28:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362955275032-28</Id><Title>a 4.7% surcharge on the incomes of the top 1% would be the $85 billion the gop wants to sequester</Title><Msg>top 1% take in about 20% of the nearly $9trillion of all USA AGI hiking the tax on that $1.8 trillion by 4.7% is about $85billion. You know the $85 billion the gop is happy to cut.... so that the rich can continue with historically low tax rates: ie... in 1955 the top 400 returns paid on avg 50.2% recently the top 400 paid 16.6%. and do keep in mind that the richest benefited the most from W's tax cuts... done when he and the gop hugely increased spending. Never before has the USA gone to war paid for by tax cuts for the rich... "The cost of World War II was financed primarily by a highly progressive Income Tax, as well as other taxes on corporations to prevent excess profits being derived from government contracts. Even the Vietnam War was largely financed by a surtax on incomes, paid largely by wealthier citizens rather than by the transfer of a payroll tax-generated social security Surplus to cover U.S. budget deficits.
