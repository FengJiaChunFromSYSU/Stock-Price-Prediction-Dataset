Elaine says: May 6, 2012 at 11:56 pm Well, Mitt has already been caught deferring to church authority. He was asked if he believes that “America is the new ‘Promised Land’”, in a radio interview back in March in Alabama. The interviewer asked for a yes or no answer. Instead of answering yes or no, according to a CNN report at the time, Mitt’s answer was, “You’re gonna have to go to the church and ask what they think about that.” The CNN report said that he went on to say that the Bile says that Israel is the Promised Land which, of course, the Bible believing Christians in the south wanted to hear. But first he deferred to the church, and then gave what I consder to be a non-answer answer. As I wrote when I blogged about this, the interviewer wasn’t asing Mitt what the church thinks. He was asking what Mitt thinks. Which Mitt was apparently not anxious to share. I believe that this does not bode well for the country if the unthinkable happens and he wins the general election in November. Generally, I’m not that wild about the practice of asking political leaders and wanna-be leaders about their religious beliefs. However, when the leader shows a pattern of deferring to his church authorities on religious issues rather than frankly saying what he thinks, no matter what the denomination or religion, I think it’s time to start asking questions and to start worrying about whether or not he will defer to his church leaders concerning non-religious issues, as well."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345263110000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 00:11:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345263286000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Lying for the Lord</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345262552000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 00:02:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's pretty much the GOP Mantra, too .........</Msg><Username>conservativeslieandbehomos</Username><Timestamp>1345263286000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 00:14:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345263898000-4</Id><Title>Twit tweaks twitter totals</Title><Msg>Source: Associated Press PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Forget ballot box irregularities. There’s a virtual dust-up under way over how Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney amassed more than 100,000 new Twitter followers in just one weekend. It may seem trivial, but not to social networking junkies or campaigns mindful of the need to project a digital image of popularity and power. An analysis by the technology firm Barracuda Labs found most of the Twitter users who followed Romney over that July weekend were probably fake, although it’s impossible to know who’s behind the spike: Romney’s campaign, a supporter or an opponent. Romney went from 673,000 to 814,000 followers during that time, though that number has since risen to more than 861,000. President Barack Obama has more than 18 million followers. Zac Moffatt, digital director for Romney’s campaign, said the campaign did not purchase the followers and the number is not something they care about.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345263898000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 00:24:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345264412000-5</Id><Topic><Title>What is Ryan's Job Experience ???</Title><Username>mittins_da_wimpins</Username><Timestamp>1345171795000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 22:49:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as usual, you still can't answer the question.</Msg><Username>mittins_da_wimpins</Username><Timestamp>1345264412000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 00:33:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345265042000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Lying for the Lord</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345262552000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 00:02:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh comon JB, what do y'all know about Mormons anyway, huh?

And, um, it's Mitt Romney committing it by TheCran Very interesting speculation from our friends across the pond at UK's Guardian, and it's more than idle speculation, about what exactly Mitt Romney is hiding on his tax returns. We remember, I think, that Governor Romney sold his 6434 square foot Belmont mansion in 2009 and moved into a 3000-square foot condo. Um, except he never moved into it, near as anyone can tell. Because that year, and the year after, Romney was living in his La Jolla mansion, you know, the one he wanted the $55,000 car elevator for. The house that cost them $12 million, and for which they wanted a demolition permit because the 3000 square feet wasn't big enough for them, so they could rebuild on the site. Oh, the same house they applied for, and got, a $109,000 tax reduction because of the drop in real estate market. On which they claimed the California house as their primary residence. And if they claimed the La Jolla address as their address in 2009, and January of 2010 -- when he claimed he was living in Tagg's basement, and registered, and voted in Massachussetts -- he is guilty of...voter fraud. More past the squiggle. The Guardian explains it thus: In April 2009, Romney sold his longtime Massachusetts home at 171 Marsh Street and appeared to move to La Jolla, California. He did not own a home in Massachusetts again until July 2010. (All of the Massachusetts addresses discussed here end with "Belmont, MA 02478", though one might amuse oneself surmising which address is underneath the Sharpie by the length of the redaction.) • Sometime in 2009, probably late in the year, Romney filed his 2008 tax return, identifying the address where he lived at the time of filing. He has refused to disclose a copy of that return. • Sometime in or shortly before January 2010 – that is, not long after he filed his 2008 return – Romney registered to vote in Massachusetts, stating on his voter registration form that he lived in his son Tagg's basement at 18 Greensbrook Way. In January 2010, Romney voted in Massachusetts' special election, which would be a felony if he was not a Massachusetts resident at the time.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345266053000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 01:00:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345270375000-9</Id><Topic><Title>What's Ryan's excuse?</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345243909000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:51:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jungleobimbo.......who is going to read the pages of garbage you pot - maybe CLOWN???

The Major privates are already making it painful for small PCP practices. They are paying 75-85% of my Medicare payments for routine office visits. I closed my practice to all my private insurance plans and began accepting self pay patients. Medicare Replacement Plans from private insurance companies take the Medicare cash and drop my payments to 75-85% of Medicare reimbursement. Private insurances have become a cancer that invades my only decent payer (Medicare) and drops my reimbursement. I am no longer accepting new Medicare patients because of this practice. They want to force small PCPs into the ACO's so they can pay us a flat salary. The next step will be dialing down physician salaries and the insurance companies will use the savings to add more middle managers and screening programs that duplicate current physician services. The healthcare pie is being gobbled by middle managers who add nothing but cost to the healthcare system. If the current attack on PCPs continues, I will have to close my practice, move to the mountains and work part time at the local ACO for food. Good luck seeing the same PCP when you visit your local ACO facility in the future.

By maria magers roberts First Published Aug 18 2012 Salt Lake City Tribune Candidates for the presidency should be thoroughly vetted. That is why voters deserve full disclosure of how Mitt Romney’s wealth was accumulated and invested, his offshore investments and the nature of his financial relationship with Bain Capital since his retirement. This information goes to the core of Romney’s character and values. The Republican presidential candidate and former governor released 20 years of tax returns when he was vetted for the vice presidency in 2008 before John McCain picked Sarah Palin. In his 2012 bid for the presidency, Romney has made public his 2010 tax return and expects to release his yet-to-be-completed 2011 return. But Romney’s refusal to release his tax returns for the most important years of building his wealth at Bain Capital raises a legitimate concern: Did he build his wealth through aggressive tax strategy that is questionable at best? Romney’s financial affairs lack transparency by design. President Obama fought for tax reforms eliminating special loopholes for the wealthiest, to pay down the deficit and protect the middle class, yet Romney is comfortable exploiting those loopholes, while on the stump he is promoting tax cuts. • On his recent trip abroad, Romney skipped Italy, for good reasons. Bain Capital, with Romney as CEO, made about $1 billion in a leveraged (minimal cash outlay – low-risk) buyout of an Italian company. Bloomberg News reported that Bain funneled its profits through subsidiaries in Luxembourg, a common corporate way to avoid taxes in other European countries. The buyer, Italy’s biggest telephone company, now is valued way below what it paid Bain and other investors for the business. The shock waves of this transaction are still felt in Italy. • In Romney’s self-directed individual retirement account, he used heavy leveraging and a "blocking company," thereby avoiding the "unrelated business income tax" normally imposed on such gains in IRAs. His IRA’s growth to $100 million is astounding in light of contribution limits of $30,000 annually. On its face, the IRA was likely funded in part with stock shares valued well below market. • Presidential candidates generally avoid betting the U.S. dollar will lose value by speculating in Swiss francs. Yet such speculation was the stated purpose of Romney’s "blind" trust Swiss bank account, which was closed in early 2010. Was the income reported on earlier tax returns? Did Romney timely file disclosure forms to the Treasury Department? • Romney’s large accounts held in "family trusts" raise the question whether gift taxes were paid and required disclosures were made. • Romney’s apparent disdain for tax obligations is clear from his role in Marriott International’s abusive tax shelter activities. From 1993 to 1998, Romney was head of the audit committee of the Marriott board of directors, with responsibilities that included tax planning. The so-called "Son of Boss" tax shelter helped Marriott sell $81 million of mortgage notes, reporting a $71 million "tax loss." Romney was an insider with perspective on the motivation and lack of substance in the transaction, fully understanding the tax avoidance game. Romney reportedly was the board member most familiar with the transaction. This shelter, used by Marriott and others, represented one of the largest tax-avoidance schemes in history, costing the U.S. billions in lost tax revenues. In 2008, the U.S. Federal Court of Claims ruled against Marriott, which appealed and lost again. The appeals court sided with the Department of Justice, calling Marriott’s transactions "fictitious," "artificial," "spectral," an "illusion" and a "scheme."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345304388000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 11:39:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345304610000-29</Id><Topic><Title>Willard's returns need to be seen</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345304388000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 11:39:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Mitt Romney's 2010 Tax Disclosure missing 990-T form - campaign spokesperson won't respond Presidential candidate Mitt Romney's tax returns may be more incomplete in their public release than was previously thought. Filings related to Romney's individual retirement account, already subject to press scrutiny, indicate that the presumptive GOP nominee should have filed a form accounting for unrelated business income taxes. The unrelated business income tax is set up for tax-exempts like nonprofits and IRAs that engage in commercial activity. Not filing the form, known as a 990-T, may indicate that Romney's IRA funds are held by an offshore account in order to shield them from taxation. Romney campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul did not return multiple requests for the 990-T form, nor did she answer repeated questions related to the matter. From what Romney has disclosed, there is mounting circumstantial evidence that the IRA may hold offshore investments through what are known as "blocker corporations," which help him avoid paying taxes.

GOP presidential candidate is a conundrum ¬snip¬ Critics say the father who railed against conservative extremism would hardly recognize the son’s accommodations to those on the right. Or his complete reversal on key issues — abortion, gun control, tax pledges and gay rights — that leave even some supporters scratching their heads about Romney’s core beliefs. “Multiple Choice Mitt,” Edward M. Kennedy famously dubbed Romney during their 1994 U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts, a charge that still echoes. Romney doesn’t attempt to explain the changes, other than to say he has “evolved” on issues. “I’m as consistent as human beings can be,” he told a New Hampshire editorial board last year. ___ Speaking to the NAACP in July, Mitt Romney said blacks would vote for him if they “understood who I truly am in my heart.” That’s a dubious assertion — his opponent is Barack Obama, after all — but it does raise the question: What is in Mitt Romney’s heart?

Although Stone is not the most reputable figure, to put it mildly, he has been a Republican insider, with access to the party’s top figures, over four decades. His credentials date back to Nixon’s Committee to Reelect The President and continue through the Reagan White House, the hard-fought Bush campaigns, and the Florida fiasco in 2000, when he masterminded the “Brooks Brothers riot” that shut down the Bush-Gore recount in Miami-Dade. Peruse his site and you’ll see his greatest hits and the attention he has drawn from major publications.

Every economist who has examined flat tax proposals over the years comes to that same conclusion: A flat tax means the rich pay less. And if the rich pay less and we raise the same amount of money, then someone else has to pay more. And the someone in this story is the middle class. It really is that simple. The flat taxers like to run around with Lake Wobegone economics where we are all going to pay less and still have the same amount of money, but the world doesn't work that way. We have tried reducing taxes to raise revenue. People remember Reagan's tax cuts and the large deficits they led to. They remember Bush's tax cuts and the large deficits they led to. No one is going to fall for this trick yet again. When we cut taxes on the rich, we get less money and the rest of us will have to make up the shortfall. For middle-class people, a flat tax means that they will have to pay more taxes. If people think it would be fairer that they pay higher taxes, then the Republican Party has the presidential candidates for you.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345323869000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:04:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345324409000-74</Id><Title>Ryan the fiscal hawk?</Title><Msg>Not so much. "Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan has gained an undeserved reputation as a “fiscal hawk,” touting his “Path to Prosperity” budget as a responsible plan to rein in what he describes as a “path to debt and decline.” But Ryan’s votes in Congress show that he is as guilty as anyone of running up the nation’s debt. Ryan voted to add a grand total of $6.8 trillion to the federal debt during his time in Congress, voting for at least 65 bills that either reduced revenue or increased spending. From 2001 to 2008, Congress passed legislation that increased the national deficit by a total of $4 trillion — the number grows to $6 trillion if you add in the how much those policies have cost through 2011. Ryan voted for 90 percent of these deficit increasing bills. What did Ryan vote to spend on? Here is a break-down of his votes: – Beginning with the Bush tax cuts, since 2001 Ryan has voted to add$2.5 trillion worth of tax cuts to the deficit. – In the last 11 years, Paul Ryan voted for every bill that called for an increase in defense spending. In total, this has added $1.9 trillion to the deficit. – Paul Ryan also voted to increase non-defense discretionary spending — the very thing he is pushing to cut now. He voted to spend $270 billion on Medicare Part D (all of which was unpaid for). He also added $80 billion to the deficit by voting for an agriculture bill in 2002, and he added another $20 billion in 2003 when he voted for changes to military retirement. Lastly, he voted for increased borrowing authority for flood insurance, adding yet another $17 billion to the deficit. Plus, Ryan’s plan won’t really balance the budget — at least not for the foreseeable future. The Tax Policy Center calculates that under Ryan’s budget plan, the federal government would only raise revenue totaling 15.8 percent of GDP. This would still make the deficit 4 percent of GDP by 2022."</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345324409000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:13:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345324943000-75</Id><Topic><Title>Flat Tax is fair</Title><Username>munchkin_muff</Username><Timestamp>1345311072000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 13:31:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>water lilly xs 8...i have to ask...wtf are you on......?????</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1345324943000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:22:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345324972000-76</Id><Title>gop dreamland fantasia tax plan</Title><Msg>as a boomer who is doing ok, i am amazed that the gop wants to give me another tax cut, plus promise that social security will continue for me AS IS, PLUS promise that medicare will ALSO continue AS IS for ME to pay about 80% of a seniors healthcare costs.........Ryan even trotted out his 78 year old mom to PROVE how medicare friendly he is! wow. did he mention that in the FUTURE younger people will get vouchers that will pay about 30% of THEIR old age health costs..... wow...... and they are expected to continue to pay for the boomers FULL medicare as is paying 80% of costs?</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345324972000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:22:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>18</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345325672000-77</Id><Title>Progressives Suck!</Title><Msg>President Romney will bring the 'Flat Tax'...so for all you whiny Progressive/Marxist/Liberals slinging economic bile, read this you Mutha "F'ers: http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2012/08/you_might_be_a_progressive_ideologue_if.html</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1345325672000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:34:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345325799000-78</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo Coke/Queer</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1345235950000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 16:39:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo is or first 'Brown Eye' Gay President!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1345325799000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:36:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345325807000-79</Id><Title>f..k..u</Title><Msg>yahoo...commu........nist...liberal...chit suckers</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1345325807000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:36:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345326079000-80</Id><Title>yahoo analysis</Title><Msg>communist..liberal chit suckers</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1345326079000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:41:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345326248000-81</Id><Topic><Title>gop dreamland fantasia tax plan</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345324972000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:22:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>waterb lilly xs 8....the world revolves around you...that's ok if you can live with it....</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1345326248000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:44:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345326643000-82</Id><Title>To All Progreesives In This Board</Title><Msg>Please ignore this 'returnus' guy because he is getting obnoxious. returnusignoramus, you are out of control and you need mental help.</Msg><Username>rampant_rose</Username><Timestamp>1345326643000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:50:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345326783000-83</Id><Topic><Title>To All Progreesives In This Board</Title><Username>rampant_rose</Username><Timestamp>1345326643000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:50:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>to you...get fkd...i'm the one making you mental....fnk retard...lolololol</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1345326783000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:53:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345326838000-84</Id><Topic><Title>gop dreamland fantasia tax plan</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345324972000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:22:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FICA and Federal Income Tax are not the same thing.

Members from both sides of the aisle were giddy as they hailed the "Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act" as a move that would restore trust in government by making members and their staffs disclose their stock transactions within 45 days. However, there were skeptics in the Capitol when it came to those exempted from the Act. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) railed that the Act did nothing to stop the lucrative and un-American industry of unnamed individuals selling "political intelligence" (he called it "political espionage") to Wall Street and offshore investment firms. He called for these pirates of "non-public information" to register as lobbyists and disclose to whom they were selling the inside dope. In the House, that provision was stripped out by Majority Leader Eric Cantor, drawing outrage from an emotional Grassley. And now in a masterful case of investigative journalism, CNN reporters Deidre Walsh and Dana Bash have uncovered even more of Cantor's deceptive and intentional gutting of the Act. Their report revealed a huge discrepancy in the Senate and House Bill... namely, the exemption of spouses and dependent children. The CNN report revealed that the Senate bill did include a provision that covered spouses and children, "but when Cantor's office wrote the House version, this language was shifted to a different section of the bill." Spouses and dependent children were exempted from the House's new reporting requirements. When CNN first came across this discrepancy in the Senate and House versions, Cantor's office claimed "it did nothing to change the intent of the STOCK Act. But when pressed with the new information uncovered by CNN, the majority leader's office conceded it made changes to the House bill that effectively took out the requirement for spouses and children to file these reports." Finally, once they knew they were caught, Cantor's office acted like CNN hadn't written down their first answer by saying: "Since new information has been brought to our attention with respect to this discrepancy, we are reviewing our options regarding transaction reports in the House of Representatives." How could this information be "new" to Cantor? He was the one who changed it and moved it to a different section of the bill.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345339616000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 21:26:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345339731000-104</Id><Topic><Title>Cantor is DIRTY</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345339616000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 21:26:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cantor's office also told CNN they hadn't figured out when or how to fix it. He's Majority Leader, and he doesn't know when or how? The truth is he could fix it today if he wanted to. He called for 33 different votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and he can't call for a way to eliminate the "spousal and dependent children exemption" from the House version of the STOCK Act? What is Cantor's motive? There is so much smoke floating around Cantor the Capitol Police should check the batteries in his office's fire alarms. Could it have to do with his own spouse (who he exempted from the House version) being a partner in the investment firm of Alternative Investment Management LLC., a company who deals in hedge funds for "high net worth individuals"? It is no secret that Cantor was TARP's head cheerleader in the House, and AIM's president and both of the listed partners, including Mrs. Cantor, were formerly with Goldman Sachs (who received $10 billion in the bailout). According to Cantor's financial disclosure form, Mrs. Cantor at the time was with New York Private Bank &amp; Trust who also received $267 million in the bailout. Of note, NYPBT is one of the top 10 banks who haven't paid back a dime to American taxpayers. Also, SEC filings show that Mrs. Cantor's investment firm, Alternative Investment Management LLC., has a hedge fund in the Cayman Islands with assets of $134,570,536. While she is listed as a partner in AIM, Mrs. Cantor is not listed on any SEC filings. This raises two very serious questions. Is somebody trying to hide her name? Is her only job to sell political intelligence? Since his spouse is a named partner in AIM, a moron can see that Cantor obviously appears to ahve a personal financial stake and conflict in "spousal exemption," and with it, offshore tax games."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345339731000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 21:28:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345339841000-105</Id><Title>chicken chit ...inferior odumbomites</Title><Msg>....your grey matter would seize and solidify before you could compete with me...friggin trogladite wimps....you guys need to give thanks to mother natuer for involuntary actions.....</Msg><Username>returnusmaximus</Username><Timestamp>1345339841000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 21:30:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345340082000-106</Id><Title>Willard covered in DIRT</Title><Msg>Report: Romney May Have Violated Massachusetts Ethics Laws Via a Company Linked to Paul Ryan's Brother The Telegraph has a story that could prove to be a disqualifier for Romney-Ryan. August 18, 2012 | On Friday, the Telegraph reported that, as governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney may have violated state ethics laws when his administration maintained a “lucrative” contract with a company in which he had a financial stake. The company, Imagitas, had been co-founded by a former executive at Bain and Co., with $5 million in backing from Bain Capital. Paul Ryan's brother, Toby, had also been a senior manager at Bain and Co., working in the same building as Romney, before leaving to become a vice president of Imagitas. The contract was not awarded by Romney – Imagitas scored it just before he was elected. But according to Telegraph reporter Jon Swaine, “Massachusetts law requires that all state employees divest themselves of financial interests in private sector contracts with state agencies. At the time, failure to do so could have resulted in a $2,000... fine or a 2.5-year prison sentence.” He added that “the potential punishments are now stronger.” According to the Telegraph, “New state employees were obliged to prevent conflicts of interest with existing contracts. The following year, began declaring that his holdings were in a so-called "blind trust" controlled by his lawyer.”</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345340082000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 21:34:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345340668000-107</Id><Topic><Title>gop dreamland fantasia tax plan</Title><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1345324972000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 17:22:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not long ago the gop were whining that the boomers were going to bk everything....... now the gop PROMISES boomers get TAX cuts and most will also get full social security and medicare........ now if you could just get someone younger than age 55 in 2014, or whenever romenyann can do their thing, to agree how great it is that THEY will not be getting the full medicare.... and there IS a HUGE difference.. and they may not be getting the same SS as the rest of us either. like i said, thanks gop , iam ok with you giving me a huge tax cut and the current social security and medicare.
