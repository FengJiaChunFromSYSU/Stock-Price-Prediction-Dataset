The math provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers showed what the employer-sponsored insurance will mean for employers and for employees once Obamacare is implemented. As the firm explained, compensating workers will enable businesses to save money when they provide a combination of salary and health insurance because of the federal tax exclusions. For example, if a company provides coverage to a worker earning $52,000 per year in 2014, it will save $2,550.87 because of tax deductions from the insurance. When workers obtain health insurance through their employer, their take-home pay is higher.

Employees are given almost zero official guidance on how to do that, so they went after Tea Party groups because those seemed like they might be political. Keep in mind, the commissioner of the IRS at the time was a Bush appointee. The second is that while this is the first time this kind of thing has become a national scandal, it’s not the first time such activity has occurred. “I wish there was more GOP interest when I raised the same issue during the Bush administration, where they audited a progressive church in my district in what look liked a very selective way,” California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said on MSNBC Monday. “I found only one Republican, [North Carolina Rep. Walter Jones], that would join me in calling for an investigation during the Bush administration. I’m glad now that the GOP has found interest in this issue and it ought to be a bipartisan concern.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1369341641268</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 16:40:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369342013606-10</Id><Topic><Title>IRS mis-direction</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1369341641268</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 16:40:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The well-known church, All Saints Episcopal in Pasadena, became a bit of a cause célèbre on the left after the IRS threatened to revoke the church’s tax-exempt status over an anti-Iraq War sermon the Sunday before the 2004 election. “Jesus [would say], ‘Mr. President, your doctrine of preemptive war is a failed doctrine,’” rector George Regas said from the dais. The church, which said progressive activism was in its “DNA,” hired a powerful Washington lawyer and enlisted the help of Schiff, who met with the commissioner of the IRS twice and called for a Government Accountability Office investigation, saying the IRS audit violated the First Amendment and was unduly targeting a political opponent of the Bush administration. “My client is very concerned that the close coordination undertaken by the IRS allowed partisan political concerns to direct the course of the All Saints examination,” church attorney Marcus Owens, who is widely considered one of the country’s leading experts on this area of the law, said at the time. In 2007, the IRS closed the case, decreeing that the church violated rules preventing political intervention, but it did not revoke its nonprofit status. And while All Saints came under the gun, conservative churches across the country were helping to mobilize voters for Bush with little oversight. In 2006, citing the precedent of All Saints, “a group of religious leaders accused the Internal Revenue Service yesterday of playing politics by ignoring its complaint that two large churches in Ohio are engaging in what it says are political activities, in violation of the tax code,” the New York Times reported at the time. The churches essentially campaigned for a Republican gubernatorial candidate, they alleged, and even flew him on one of their planes.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1369342013606</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 16:46:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369342109785-11</Id><Topic><Title>Political Correct #$%$-London Beheading</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369321973958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 11:12:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Police in London is not armed.

The IRS opened an audit into the church, but it went nowhere after the church appealed the audit on a technicality. And it wasn’t just churches. In 2004, the IRS went after the NAACP, auditing the nation’s oldest civil rights group after its chairman criticized President Bush for being the first sitting president since Herbert Hoover not to address the organization. “They are saying if you criticize the president we are going to take your tax exemption away from you,” then-chairman Julian Bond said. “It’s pretty obvious that the complainant was someone who doesn’t believe George Bush should be criticized, and it’s obvious of their response that the IRS believes this, too.” In a letter to the IRS, Democratic Reps. Charles Rangel, Pete Stark and John Conyers wrote: “It is obvious that the timing of this IRS examination is nothing more than an effort to intimidate the members of the NAACP, and the communities the organization represents, in their get-out-the-vote effort nationwide.” Then, in 2006, the Wall Street Journal broke the story of a how a little-known pressure group called Public Interest Watch — which received 97 percent of its funds from Exxon Mobile one year — managed to get the IRS to open an investigation into Greenpeace. Greenpeace had labeled Exxon Mobil the “No. 1 climate criminal.” The IRS acknowledged its audit was initiated by Public Interest Watch and threatened to revoke Greenpeace’s tax-exempt status, but closed the investigation three months later."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1369342122306</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 16:48:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369342212375-13</Id><Topic><Title>Political Correct #$%$-London Beheading</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369321973958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 11:12:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mooseleems=Murderers</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369342212375</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 16:50:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369342667773-14</Id><Topic><Title>There IS 'There There'</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369311337427</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 08:15:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Club 'FED' jail for all these Feehg-uts!</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369342667773</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 16:57:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369342832694-15</Id><Title>day trading comebackk...HUGE PROFITS FOR eTRADE: TRADING + mbs LOANS.</Title><Msg>hUGE GAP UP ANY MOMENT</Msg><Username>arcanos70</Username><Timestamp>1369342832694</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 17:00:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369344521699-16</Id><Title>Never ending GOP assault on women</Title><Msg>Does This Look Familiar? May 23, 2013 GOP Men Target Women’s Rights — Again Remember when House Republicans held a hearing on birth control and only had men testify? Well, here’s what the group of lawmakers who held a hearing today on an unconstitutional 20-week abortion ban looked like: Looks familiar, doesn’t it? Chairing today’s hearing was Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ) who is championing a blatantly unconstitutional nationwide ban on abortion after 20 weeks. Franks has worked for years to take away women’s constitutionally protected rights, especially for women living in the District of Columbia, but today’s hearing was particularly galling. Just this week, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a similar ban enacted by Franks’ home state of Arizona is unquestionably unconstitutional and permanently prohibited the state from enforcing it. These men showed about as much sensitivity as one would expect. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told a female witness that even though her fetus had no brain function she should have waited and given birth anyway. The all-male lineup shown above echoes another anti-abortion event to tout Franks’ bill held by Republicans yesterday. It was also dominated by men. Meanwhile, across the Potomac in Virginia, Republicans just chose three viciously anti-abortion, anti-gay men to fill their slate for governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general. BOTTOM LINE: Women have the right to make their own health care decisions, so it’s time for Republican men and their allies to drop their war on women.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1369344521699</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 17:28:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369344778776-17</Id><Topic><Title>Never ending GOP assault on women</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1369344521699</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 17:28:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"These men showed about as much sensitivity as one would expect.

Nine Republicans voted against the bill, and two Democrats voted for it. House Republicans tried to disguise their plan to raise student loan interest rates as saving the student loan program by making it a part of the “free market.” What House Republicans passed is a variable rate scheme where a student’s loan rate would be reset every year, so that the loan rate the student paid as a freshman would likely increased each year until they graduated. The Washington Post reported that the bill would cause the interest rate on a Stafford Loan to double, “Students who max out their subsidized Stafford loans over four years would pay $8,331 in interest payments under the Republican bill, and $3,450 if rates were kept at 3.4 percent. If rates were allowed to double in July, that amount would be $7,284 over the typical 10-year window to repay the maximum $19,000.” The point of this bill wasn’t to save the student loan program, but to kill it. The Republican goal is to turn student loans back over to the banks. By turning student loans into variable rate loans, House Republicans are laying the groundwork for the big banks to make huge profits off of students should they get their hands on student loans again</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1369348098830</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 18:28:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369350683149-20</Id><Title>The Cartel Just Fired Lois Lerner....</Title><Msg>I guess they think the problems will just go away if they play a shell game....
