Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., stole and misused an e-mail distribution list maintained by an Iowa home school group during her failed 2012 presidential campaign. This morning, the seven-day trial in Heki v. Bachmann was scheduled for May 14, 2014, court records show. Also this morning, Bachmann, a Minnesota congresswoman, announced she will not seek re-election in 2014. She said in a videotaped message that “this decision was not impacted in any way by the recent inquiries into the activities of my former presidential campaign or my former presidential staff.” She has maintained she did nothing wrong. A 12-page Polk County lawsuit filed last July alleges that two Iowans, Barbara and Richard Heki, suffered “severe emotional distress and loss of current and future business opportunities” after two unapproved emails were sent from the Bachmann for President campaign to members of the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators (NICHE).</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1369890648601</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 01:10:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369891346528-7</Id><Topic><Title>Trump to run in 2016!

Of Rosen Subpoena IGOR BOBIC , WEDNESDAY MAY 29, 2013 The Department of Justice claims it has proof it alerted the parent company of Fox News of a subpoena used to obtain the phone log records of Washington correspondent James Rosen as part of an investigation into a 2010 leak of classified information, according to CNN. "The Justice Department is telling us here at CNN....that it showed a Fox News notification according to the Justice Department of this James Rosen investigation nearly three years ago," CNN's Jim Acosta reported on air Wednesday, per a rush transcript. "To back that up, earlier this afternoon Justice and law enforcement producer Carol Cratty was shown by a law enforcement official documents indicating as much of this notification to the parent company of Fox News, News Corporation." The Justice Department previously said it had notified News Corp. of the seizure on Aug. 27, 2010, but company officials over the weekend countered by claiming they had no such record. News Corp.'s chief legal counsel at the time also issued a strong denial of ever receiving a subpoena from the government. "Consistent with the department policies, and procedures, the government provided notification of the subpoenas they're saying for phone records and other pieces of information nearly three years ago by certified mail, fax, and e-mail," a DOJ official said in a statement obtained by Acosta.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1369893017448</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 01:50:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369905182176-9</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo's best Friend, Attorney General EricHolder to RESIGN!!</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369764478293</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 14:07:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Eric Holder career as the 'Dumbo Lie' security officer is over.</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369905182176</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 05:13:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369905269048-10</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo's Mistress has 'The Video' (Benghazi)</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369863177345</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 17:32:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo, Hillary, Holder is the Socio-Path Trio.</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369905269048</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 05:14:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369905360319-11</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo has a Mistress</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1369840793205</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 11:19:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo has 'Needs'.

That provision, which went into effect in September 2010, was one of the first major parts of the Affordable Care Act to take effect, allowing young adults to stay on their parents' health plans until their 26th birthday. The Centers for Disease control estimates that the dependent-coverage provision expanded insurance coverage to about 3.1 million adults between the ages of 19 and 25. The RAND Corporation study was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. ....... "We're thinking that prior to the Affordable Care Act, that $147 million would be picked up by patients, their families, the hospitals that care for them and perhaps the tax payers that serve as a backstop to hospitals," says Katherine Harris, a senior economist with RAND. "We're seeing that instead, insurance is doing its job and picking up those costs."</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1369928603191</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 11:43:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369928635594-19</Id><Topic><Title>DOJ proves Fox lied</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1369893017448</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 01:50:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fubar, After your outrageous comment about the President and Sasha you should go into hiding for a while, or at least change your handle.

In the exchange, Rosen used the alias “Leo” to address Kim and called himself “Alex,” an apparent reference to Alexander Butterfield, the man best known for running the secret recording system in the Nixon White House, according to the affidavit. Rosen instructed Kim to send him coded signals on his Google account, according to a quote from his e-mail in the affidavit: “One asterisk means to contact them, or that previously suggested plans for communication are to proceed as agreed; two asterisks means the opposite.” He also wrote, according to the affidavit: “What I am interested in, as you might expect, is breaking news ahead of my competitors” including “what intelligence is picking up.” And: “I’d love to see some internal State Department analyses.” Heads on both sides should roll for this. Mr Kim's for leaking national security information unto the press and Rosen for conspiring to break the law.</Msg><Username>bypartisan305</Username><Timestamp>1369931566464</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 12:32:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369932206220-26</Id><Topic><Title>66 days into session 112th congress has passes....wait for it.....</Title><Username>sec_fordummies</Username><Timestamp>1369931042202</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 12:24:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A seriously impressive record that'll stand for at least another two years.

In the meantime both sides can use whatever isn't needed for critical bipartisan legislation making ludicrous proposals and passing legislation the other body will never bother to try to reconcile.

It passed by a vote of 25-14. The plan also cuts the state income tax. Now it goes to the House, but its fate there is not very promising. Governor Sam Brownback would like the sales tax to stay at the current rate to make up for income tax cuts last year and the House is inclined to do what the governor wants. The situation has some urgency as the Kansas legislature is working overtime in Topeka to get business completed before their summer break. Aw, poor babies. Enter State Rep. Jeff Melcher, the leader of the opponents of the Senate’s plan. His arguments against the tax rollback are not based on economics, however. He’s worried that lower prices on food will move the poor to buy more… food. Let that one roll around your brain for a minute, I’ll wait. Your head still in one piece? Okay, here’s Melcher’s insane troll logic: “It seems to me we are encouraging the behavior of purchasing food and discouraging the behavior of purchasing anything else.”</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369935512654</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 13:38:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369935875861-35</Id><Topic><Title>brain washed rightwingnuts won't buy the same light bulb if it is labeled evironmentally friendly</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369935410860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 13:36:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The study then presented participants with a real-world choice: With a fixed amount of money in their wallet, respondents had to “buy” either an old-school lightbulb or an efficient compact florescent bulb (CFL), the same kind Bachmann railed against. Both bulbs were labeled with basic hard data on their energy use, but without a translation of that into climate pros and cons. When the bulbs cost the same, and even when the CFL cost more, conservatives and liberals were equally likely to buy the efficient bulb. But slap a message on the CFL’s packaging that says “Protect the Environment,” and “we saw a significant drop-off in more politically moderates and conservatives choosing that option,” said study author Dena Gromet, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. Got that? With all other factors being equal, conservatives were less likely to buy the exact same lightbulb if you told them it would help the environment. They didn't have any more aversion to buying energy-saving lightbulbs than anyone else, unless the package pointed out that this particular lightbulb was slightly less earth-screwing than the other one. Tell them that, and they were more likely to go for the other one.

Source: nyt/reuters U.S. Senator John McCain said on Wednesday, two days after meeting with rebels in Syria, that he is confident the United States can send weapons to fighters in Syria without the risk they will fall into the wrong hands. "We can identify who these people are. We can help the right people," McCain said on CNN's program "Anderson Cooper 360." . . Critics of some lawmakers' push to arm the rebels have expressed concerns that weapons could end up in the hands of militants who might eventually end up using them against the United States or its allies. But McCain said such radical fighters make up only a small part of the rebels forces.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369946060228</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 16:34:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369946221251-64</Id><Topic><Title>McCain can recognize good guys</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369946060228</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 16:34:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A day later...... McCain Didn’t Realize He Was Posing With Rebel Kidnapper, Spokesman Says Senator John McCain’s office is pushing back against reports that while visiting Syria this week he posed in a photo with rebels who kidnapped 11 Lebanese Shi’ite pilgrims. The photo, released by McCain’s office, shows McCain with a group of rebels. Among them are two men identified in the Lebanese press as Mohamed Nour and Abu Ibrahim, two of the kidnappers of the group from Lebanon. A McCain spokesman said that no one who met with McCain identified themselves by either of those names. “In coordination with the Syrian Emergency Task Force, Senator John McCain traveled to and from Syria with General Salim Idris, the chief of staff of the Supreme Military Council of the Syrian opposition, to meet with two senior Free Syrian Army commanders,” said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers on Wednesday in an email to BuzzFeed. “None of the individuals the Senator planned to meet with was named Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim. A number of other Syrian commanders joined the meeting, but none of them identified himself as Mohamad Nour or Abu Ibrahim.”</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369946221251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 16:37:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369946253530-65</Id><Topic><Title>brain washed rightwingnuts won't buy the same light bulb if it is labeled evironmentally friendly</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369935410860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 13:36:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What do light bulbs have to do with Holder being tossed under the bus by his boss Obama?</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1369946253530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 16:37:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369946510446-66</Id><Topic><Title>McCain can recognize good guys</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1369946060228</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 16:34:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is why McClown lost the election, though he still would have been an improvement to the present occupant.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1369946510446</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 16:41:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369947661303-67</Id><Topic><Title>brain washed rightwingnuts won't buy the same light bulb if it is labeled evironmentally friendly</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1369935410860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 13:36:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice analysis, the "statistical outlier":..... yep...... it is amazing that someone would make such a ridiculous claim... and go to such great lengths...... if it were true the power company would pay for his $70 surge suppressor as they are required to maintain power within a 5% tolerance.
