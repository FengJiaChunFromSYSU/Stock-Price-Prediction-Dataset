Curry: Romney as governor: a very practiced liar snip: I am an independent with no party affiliation but from an ideological viewpoint, I am well to the right of center. Still, I cannot support Mitt Romney for president. Having worked directly with Romney during his term as Massachusetts governor, I can tell you that there is nothing authentic or genuine about him. He'll tell you what he thinks that you want to hear and pretend to be what he thinks you want him to be. He's an ideological chameleon who will say anything to get your support and then do whatever he wants to favor the rich and privileged; he's a caricature of the stereotyped Republican Party. He lies frequently and convincingly, and has elastic principles, if any at all. He's fundamentally dishonest, while presenting an image of goodness and light. He didn't run for a second term as governor because he knew that he would have been soundly defeated by the voters who experienced what he was really like. He'll be lucky if he gets within 20 percentage points of Obama in Massachusetts in this election. Romney doesn't say much about his governorship, and those things that he does say are either lies or extreme distortions.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1351259783078</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:56:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351259969747-8</Id><Topic><Title>Angry Dumbo (LOSING!!!)</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351185719373</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 13:21:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo is a complete #$%$.

The automaker is targeting 500,000 annual sales outside North America by 2014, more than triple its overseas deliveries in 2009. Chrysler currently builds all Jeep SUV models at plants in Michigan, Illinois and Ohio. Manley referred to adding Jeep production sites rather than shifting output from North America to China.

But that wasn’t enough, and it was partly negated by austerity in state and local governments. Still, America’s economy is now the fastest growing among major countries in the West, and Britain’s is shrinking. Which would you prefer? I’m not suggesting Obama distribute bumper stickers saying: “It Could Be Worse.” He might want to “Osama’s Dead and G.M. Is Alive.” it would have been MUCH worse had Mccain won......

Lena Dunham, the creator of the HBO hit series 'Girls,' compares her first voting experience to losing her virginity in a new ad paid for by the Obama campaign 'The consequences are huge,' she continues.

The Energy Department’s inspector general also said grantees who received the green jobs-training money did a poor job of reporting their results. Only 38 percent of those who have completed training got jobs based on it, and only 16 percent kept jobs for at least six months — the key measure of success for the program. “Outcomes for participants were far less than originally proposed,” the auditors said. The government earmarked more than $400 million for green jobs training programs, and $328.5 million has been spent so far. About half were already working in the energy sector and wanted retraining, and half were potential new energy workers. Of those workers who already had energy-sector jobs, the auditors said they were retrained, even though they didn’t need it. “We found no evidence that the incumbent workers in our sample required services or training to keep their job or obtain a new one,” the investigators said in their report.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1351278423087</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:07:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351278589859-61</Id><Topic><Title>Do you want 4 more years of this waste</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1351278423087</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:07:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo-nomics!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351278589859</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:09:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351279722124-62</Id><Title>its funny</Title><Msg>the republiscum is so worried about losing he even has traitors to america trying to extort the vote of hard working americans I say don't do business with any of these companies in protest!!!already stopped looking at westgate resorts.This is america not nazi germany!!republiscum IMHO</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1351279722124</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:28:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351280286368-63</Id><Topic><Title>Do you want 4 more years of this waste</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1351278423087</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 15:07:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what we don't want is to let repugnicans do even more damage to our country.

After the Obama administration instituted the Home Affordable Refinancing Program (HARP) to help homeowners refinance their mortgages at lower interest rates, Freddie Mac placed heavy restrictions on the program out of fear that it would hurt the company’s bottom line and its ability to repay taxpayers. But two Republican appointees and one executive also held back the program, ProPublica’s Jesse Eisenger reports, because they thought it would help the economy under a Democratic president: In closed door meetings, two Republican-leaning board members and at least one executive resisted a mass refi policy for an additional reason, according to the interviews: They regarded it as a backdoor economic stimulus. Robert Glauber, who left Freddie’s board in March, contended in board meetings that aspects of the refinancing program were “designed to be a stimulus” for the economy, said John Koskinen, who served as Freddie Mac’s chairman from 2008 to 2011, during which time he also served briefly as its interim chief executive. Glauber, director Linda Bammann and head of risk management Paige Wisdom resisted mass refis. One executive viewed their objections as colored by partisan unwillingness to help the economy recover, something that would benefit President Obama.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1351282815565</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 16:20:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351282900740-69</Id><Topic><Title>Dumbo guided by marxist thugs</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351277715802</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:55:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dumbo's favorite bath House game: 'Drop the Soap'!!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351282900740</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 16:21:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351286493692-70</Id><Topic><Title>More evidence of GOP obstructionism</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1351282815565</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 16:20:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>By Travis Waldron on Oct 26, 2012 And who is this esteemed intellectual you have glommed on to...have you ever had an orginal thought in your life?</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1351286493692</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 17:21:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351290620241-71</Id><Topic><Title>CIA OPS 'DENIED HELP' DURING BENGHAZI...</Title><Username>leftie_weezner</Username><Timestamp>1351271587052</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 13:13:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Big News..More coming out..LOTs more!!</Msg><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1351290620241</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 18:30:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351291440734-72</Id><Title>Dead Navy Seal father's interview (DUMBO LYING!!!)</Title><Msg>Its really tough to hear the words of this father.
