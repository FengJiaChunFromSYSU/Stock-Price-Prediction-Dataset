Already a number of other journalists have been banned from the White House news crew for asking inconvenient questions at difficult times. Woodward joining them will just be another drop in the bucket. Gene Sperling was a friend for pointing out to Woodward that the time was fast approaching when he might be joining the list as well. Now he knows, like the rest of the White House press corp, to temper his remarks about the President.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1362162574411</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 13:29:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362163398600-4</Id><Topic><Title>Major Boehner</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1362068685354</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 11:24:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ain't gonna happen, if the Senate is required to pass a budget it would mean the DNC actually taking a paper backed stand on something, thus giving Republicans something solid to criticize.

But with prices well over $4 a gallon, drivers may be shocked to learn that the state of California is now raising the tax on a gallon of gas. "There will be a 3.5-cent change," said Jaime Garza, spokesman with the California Board of Equilization. That became official when the California Board of Equalization voted to approve the hike on Thursday. It's set to go into effect July 1." The board of 5 decides 38 millions of Californians do not pay enough for making their cars to move, going to work, bringing kids from to scool, shopping, vacationing. Who is that going to hurt?

The eMail's followed that exchange, so if you ONLY read the eMail's you get the idea there was no heat behind the comment until you read between the lines. Further the eMails themselves were fairly amiable. And he wasn't threatening Woodward in a personal way, just indicating that if he continued asking inconvenient questions he might, as an example, find himself perhaps barred from the Whitehouse press pool. In other words, "no hard feelings, it's just business". That kind of "amiability".</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1362171313101</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 15:55:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362171505040-11</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone using E-trade X-Trader</Title><Username>janusz_jozwiak</Username><Timestamp>1362165528044</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 14:18:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't do futures, so I'm content even without ETPro, I just use the ET360 app they're working on in combination with the web embedded tools.

Apparently WH goes against their own loyal supporters. O'REILLY: Continuing now with our lead story. The Obama administration objecting to critical reporting of it. Speaking on the radio today, former Clinton advisor Lanny Davis said that while he was writing a column his editor was threatened by the Obama Administration. DAVIS: He received a phone call from a senior Obama White House official who didn't like some of my columns, even though I'm a supporter of him, I couldn't imagine why this call was made. And he did threaten and the word I was told was the word "threaten" by this editor that if he continued to run my columns, he would lose or his reporters would lose their White House credentials. DAVIS: "This one individual who called my editor made some very serious threats against me professionally." Bob Woodward was an outspoken critic of Bush administration Iraq war. Never received any threats from Bush WH. A veteran is scolded, threatened by the bosses he faithfully supports. This WH doesn't need reporters. Something reminds me good ol KGB and Soviet propaganda machine.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1362175133371</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 16:58:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362179720073-14</Id><Topic><Title>Bob Woodward To Hannity: I Never Called WH Email A 'Threat,'</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1362176170715</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 17:16:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"how many "mainstream" journalists are nothing more than shills for the right wing" Bob Woodward a right wing journalist?
