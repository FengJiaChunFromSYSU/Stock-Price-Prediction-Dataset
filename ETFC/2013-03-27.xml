Dolan Tuesday, March 26, 2013 20:39 EDT A gunman walked through a neighborhood in Tacoma, Washington and fired at houses indiscriminately, according to multiple media reports. No injuries have been reported. Police contained the gunman within his home. He has refused to surrender and is believed to have multiple firearms. Sheriff’s spokesman Ed Troyer said the man has mental health issues. He may have been drinking before the incident. Media helicopters have been ordered to stay 3 miles away. “His firepower is strong enough to reach the helicopters,” Troyer said.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1364357068134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 00:04:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364390546813-2</Id><Title>the trickle trickled up</Title><Msg>In 1983 the poorest 47% of America had $15,000 per family, 2.5 percent of the nation's wealth.

At the other extreme, the 400 wealthiest Americans own as much wealth as 80 million families -- 62% of America. The reason, once again, is the stock market. Since 1980 the American GDP has approximately doubled. Inflation-adjusted wages have gone down. But the stock market has increased by over ten times, and the richest quintile of Americans owns 93% of it.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1364390546813</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 09:22:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364390684814-3</Id><Topic><Title>the trickle trickled up</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1364390546813</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 09:22:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>America Split in Two: Five Ugly Extremes of Inequality by Paul Buchheit The first step is to learn the facts, and then to get angry and to ask ourselves, as progressives and caring human beings, what we can do about the relentless transfer of wealth to a small group of well-positioned Americans. 1. $2.13 per hour vs. $3,000,000.00 per hour Each of the Koch brothers saw his investments grow by $6 billion in one year, which is three million dollars per hour based on a 40-hour 'work' week.

In the early 90's the massive military builddown left us with little heavy manufacturing capability, and as of this year the United States no longer manufactures or for the most part fields Main Battle Tanks (Obama thinks they are tools of oppression). So what happened to the M1A2SEP? We largely left them in Kuwait, and those few we didn't are almost entirely in one formation. So what would happen should North Korea invade the south this fall? I could have told you from 1980 to 2004 or so, but I have no idea since then, it could go either way. Depends on how the ROK troops hold up, which historical precedent would seem to indicate we'd get our rears kicked. The only reason the North has for staying its hand is that the longer the Obama administration continues the weaker we get, and that the only triggers for going forward are our destruction of their nuclear capability (or attempted destruction) an incipient famine that only a surge South will prevent (to both reduce population and capture foodstuffs), or a power struggle near the top that needs an external enemy to take advantage of.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1364394031918</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 10:20:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364394305453-9</Id><Title>Mike Huckabee Threatens GOP:</Title><Msg>Support Marriage Equality And Evangelicals Will Form Third Party By David Badash Mike Huckabee is threatening the GOP, warning them that if they support same-sex marriage, evangelicals will form a third party.

Instead of for everyone except those whose moral views we as individuals don't agree with. Sure it'll repel a core constituency of the right, but they''re only a recent Constituency before being diehard Democrats until Democrats decided that pandering to racial differences would gain them a larger one. At the time it seemed logical as most Blacks were also reverent Christians at the time, and the Christian Conservatives in the South had been Democrats for decades. By combining the two they thought to create a more powerful voting bloc by taking the entire African American vote from the Republican party. And it worked, to a point, at least in advancing the Civil Rights Movement and bringing in a larger constituency, but the tactics they used to achieve it grated on Southern Dixiecrats so much that the South largely became a Republican voting block out of pure backlash. So, push the Evangelicals back toward the left and the Republican party will consist almost entirely of rational people, meaning they'll lose every election 80:20 or worse (in the cities). The two remaining parties will be the Democrats and the Christians. Oh joy.

Since most US large corporations are largely Intellectual Property based now rather than expressed through manufacturing power, that would be most of them. Those cleaners you see in there making minimum wage certainly aren't hired by the companies directly, but rather work for service agencies hired by companies to do their cleaning, and are prohibited from certain areas. Even the scrummy startup I was involved in paid more than that to our technical service people (yes, we did our own, such as it was, rather than out contracting). That is, if we paid anything at all . . . in some cases we had player volunteers helping in organizing, managing, and proctoring our forums, etc, for the benefit of the other players. The game doesn't allow modding so that was as close as they could come to "creating user content". Now we have a program were if they want a particular feature added to the game, well, they can help pay the development costs . . . . and some do!

Sebelius: Yep, ObamaCare is raising insurance costs A watershed moment in the ongoing disaster of ObamaCare, as Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius finally admits that health insurance premiums are rising because of the President’s health insurance takeover, per the Wall Street Journal: Ms. Sebelius’s remarks come weeks before insurers are expected to begin releasing rates for plans that start on Jan. 1, 2014, when key provisions of the health law kick in. Premiums have been a sensitive subject for the Obama administration, which is counting on elements in the health law designed to increase competition among insurers to keep rates in check. The administration has pointed to subsidies that will be available for many lower-income Americans to help them with the cost of coverage. The secretary’s remarks are among the first direct statements from federal officials that people who have skimpy health plans right now could face higher premiums for plans that are more generous. She noted that the law requires plans to provide better benefits and treat all customers equally regardless of their medical claims. “These folks will be moving into a really fully insured product for the first time, and so there may be a higher cost associated with getting into that market,” she said. “But we feel pretty strongly that with subsidies available to a lot of that population that they are really going to see much better benefit for the money that they’re spending.”</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1364411455777</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 15:10:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364412141255-27</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi</Title><Username>radionazi4morons</Username><Timestamp>1364396730915</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 11:05:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where are those Democrats looking for 9/11 truth?

BTW; did you know that in 1945, a B 25 bomber crashed into the 78th floor of the Empire State building ? It left a big hole that was repaired. The building didn't come down. And that was OLD construction. Had none of the high tech safety of modern skyscapers.

In some of the other countries, health care administrative expenses are born by the general fisc. In other words, its just a different color of money (as they used to tell me at MIT). I pointed out that maintaining an archaic system whose service contract was so expensive you could buy a "new" used machine every month was stupid. They told me "new machines" were capital expenditures, but "service contracts" were a different color of money so no, I couldn't go just buy a pile of spare parts and maintain it internally and save a fortune. I replaced the pathetic thing with a Mac. With a service contract. Who knows, it may still be there in one form or another.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1364415088086</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 16:11:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364415129283-36</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi</Title><Username>radionazi4morons</Username><Timestamp>1364396730915</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 11:05:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Didn't you read my post?
