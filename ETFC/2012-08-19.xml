The pictures had been transmitted back to the White House Situation Room as part of the process of confirming that bin Laden was dead during the raid by Navy SEALS in Pakistan a year ago. Williams and an NBC team got unprecedented White House access for an hour-long report "Inside the Situation Room" tonight on Rock Center. When asked about seeing the first photo of bin Laden, who had been shot in the head, the president took a long pause. "I think it's wrong to say that I did a high-five," he tells Williams, "because you have a picture of a dead body and, you know, there's I think regardless of who it is, you always have to be sober about death. But understanding the satisfaction for the American people, what it would mean for 9/11 families, what it would mean for the children of folks who died in the twin towers who never got to know their parents, I think there was a deep-seated satisfaction for the country at that moment." Williams also spoke to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton about events that night. Clinton says she believes strongly that the president was right not to release the photos. "I looked at them," she says. "Obviously, (it's) never easy to see any dead body, but it was part of the job. I think we made the right decision not to sensationalize this, not to desecrate it, so to speak. His body was flown to a Navy ship. It was given a proper Islamic burial at sea and I think that we handled it exactly right."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345349464000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 00:11:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345349820000-3</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Wimp!!</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345346884000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 23:28:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Slayer has to see the photo in a gay porn movie before he believes it's true.</Msg><Username>lonelygaybillie</Username><Timestamp>1345349820000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 00:17:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345349982000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Wimp!!</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345346884000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 23:28:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tuesday, May 03, 2011 11:34:48 AM U.S. officials reportedly have two sets of photos of a dead Osama bin Laden. The first set were reportedly taken at a military hanger after his body was removed from his compound in Pakistan. The second set of photos were reportedly taken on the USS Carl Vinson, shortly before his remains were lowered into the North Arabian Sea. News of the second set comes from a U.S. government official quoted by Fox News. The White House is still deciding whether or not to release a photograph of Usama bin Laden's body, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday. "I don't have any updates on that," Carney said when asked whether the White House would release a photo of the dead terrorist leader. "We will continue to review that and make decisions about the appropriateness of releasing that information." "There are sensitivities here concerning the appropriateness of releasing photos of Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of this fight," Carney went on. He added, "It's fair to say that it's a gruesome photograph." Bin Laden was killed by a shot above his left eye. The shot blew away part of his skull. Bin Laden was also shot in the chest. Officials don't want to inflame Islamic community by showing graphic images but want to disprove claims that the terror leader is actually still alive.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345349982000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 00:19:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345350215000-5</Id><Topic><Title>Hey Wimp!!</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345346884000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-18 23:28:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...."was right not to release the photos."

Assessing the aloof and socially awkward Romney's stumbles during his first White House run, author Robert Draper explained, "His camp doesn't need to turn their guy into someone you'd have a beer with. They just need to eliminate the bugs in the machine." Now as Election Day nears, Romney and his programmers have made quite clear that they have designed political cowardice into his operating system. And with good reason. After all, Romney's gymnastic flip-flops serially transformed him from "progressive Republican" to social conservative and back to business manager left both him and American voters dizzy. Just as problematic, his pathological lying spawned its own cottage industry (Steve Benen's chronicles of Mitt's Mendacity is now up to Volume XXX), leaving analysts to turn to Freud, Shakespeare and even quantum physics to comprehend the scope and speed of his dissembling. So to avoid political self-destruction over the details of his own policy proposals, Team Mitt has coded its Romney-Bot to auto-respond, "no comment." As evidenced his campaign's bogus charges on Medicare, Mitt Romney has an attack mode. But when it comes to the specifics of their ticket's plans, Team Romney wants both Mitt and his running mate Paul Ryan to zip it: Advisers say the campaign has no plans to pivot from its previous view that diving into details during a general-election race would be suicidal. The Romney strategy is simple: Hammer away at Obama for proposing cuts to Medicare and promise, in vague, aspirational ways, to protect the program for future retirees -- but don't get pulled into a public discussion of the most unpopular parts of the Ryan plan. "The nature of running a presidential campaign is that you're communicating direction to the American people," a Romney adviser said. "Campaigns that are about specifics, particularly in today's environment, get tripped up." That secrecy has been at the center of every Romney discussion of taxes, both his own and those of the American people. Regarding his own mysterious finances, Romney explained that "I don't put out which tooth paste I use, either" and branded the 63 percent of Americans wanting to see his tax returns as "small-minded." As for the Romney-Ryan tax plan which relies on closing trillions in loopholes and deductions over the next decade, that too cannot be revealed in "the light of day." In March, Mitt boasted that was also a feature and not a bug: "So I haven't laid out all of the details about how we're going to deal with each deduction, so I think it's kind of interesting for the groups to try and score it, because frankly it can't be scored, because those kinds of details will have to be worked out with Congress, and we have a wide array of options."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345353236000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 01:13:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345353265000-7</Id><Topic><Title>He's just "Lying for the Lord"</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345353236000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 01:13:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Earlier this year, Romney revealed the roots of his voter phobia. As he explained to the Weekly Standard, when you make promises to the electorate, they have an unfortunate tendency to take you at your word: "One of the things I found in a short campaign against Ted Kennedy was that when I said, for instance, that I wanted to eliminate the Department of Education, that was used to suggest I don't care about education," Romney recalled. "So I think it's important for me to point out that I anticipate that there will be departments and agencies that will either be eliminated or combined with other agencies. So for instance, I anticipate that housing vouchers will be turned over to the states rather than be administered at the federal level, and so at this point I think of the programs to be eliminated or to be returned to the states, and we'll see what consolidation opportunities exist as a result of those program eliminations. So will there be some that get eliminated or combined? The answer is yes, but I'm not going to give you a list right now." For months, the Romney campaign auto-response of "no comment" has been on display across a gamut of issues ranging from the mass deportation of illegal aliens and Ohio's anti-labor laws to extension of the payroll tax cut and even GOP debate attendees booing a gay active duty U.S. soldier. In a December interview with the Wall Street Journal, the Romney-Bot acknowledged his cowardice was simply his app working as designed: Amid such generalities, it's hard not to conclude that the candidate is trying to avoid offering any details that might become a political target. And he all but admits as much. "I happen to also recognize," he says, "that if you go out with a tax proposal which conforms to your philosophy but it hasn't been thoroughly analyzed, vetted, put through models and calculated in detail, that you're gonna get hit by the demagogues in the general election." Of course, what the Romdroid identifies as "demagogues," most Americans call "voters." That's why the Romney campaign is going to focus on his professional life rather than his personal story at this month's Republican National Convention. And with good reason. Romney's persistent "empathy gap" shows that the American people don't want a robot to lead them. But they may yet get a robot in the White House, and a cowardly one at that."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345353265000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 01:14:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345379907000-8</Id><Title>thx for the freebies gop</Title><Msg>Ok, Romneyann , you promise me a tax cut, plus social security and medicare AS IS.......is that right? well OK , are you sure? that's better than FREE! full SS &amp; medicare PLUS a tax cut!!!!! any here younger than age 55 when romneyann plan could take effect care to comment on YOUR medicare compared to those over age 55 at that time who will get the FULL AS IS medicare ?

What we don’t know for sure is how much Romney paid in any year except 2010. Yesterday, Romney claimed to have paid at least 13 percent every year for the past 10 years, but he of course offered zero proof for this claim. The American people have literally no way of knowing if this is true or not unless Mitt Romney comes clean and releases his tax returns. Here are seven questions about his taxes that Mitt Romney has left unanswered: 1) What kind of taxes? Does that 13 percent cover income taxes, capital gains taxes, or some combination? By Romney’s own admission, nearly all of his income comes from investments (so the low capital gains tax rate helps him drive his overall rate far below that of many middle-class families). 2) What sort of deductions did Romney employ? In addition to the deduction they receive for classifying Ann Romney’s horse as a business, what other deductions are the Romneys using to lower their tax rate? 3) How did Romney’s IRA grow so large? Romney’s retirement account contains more than $100 million, despite annual limits on contributions. How did that happen? 4) What sort of offshore tax strategies does Romney use? While Romney was on the executive committee of Marriott, the company employed complex strategies known as “Son of Boss” to dodge taxes, prompting consequences with the IRS. Did Romney use a similar strategy for his own taxes? 5) Was Romney’s Swiss bank account disclosed on all tax returns for all years? Did he file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) as required by the deadline for each year he had the account? 6) Did Romney participate in the IRS’s settlement initiative for undeclared offshore financial accounts (the amnesty)? In 2009, the IRS gave American citizens a window to declare their Swiss bank accounts and avoid prosecution for tax dodging, before it launched a crackdown on foreign accounts. As Slate’s Matt Yglesias wrote, “Romney might well have thought in 2007 and 2008 that there was nothing to fear about a non-disclosed offshore account he’d set up years earlier precisely because it wasn’t disclosed. But then came the settlement and the rush of non-disclosers to apply for the amnesty.” 7) Why did Romney invest in Houston rental real estate that was explicitly marketed as a tax shelter? As The New York Times reported, Romney was an investor in a real estate scheme in which the organizers “played up the tax shelter benefits.” The deal turned out to be a lousy investment. Yesterday, Romney also called questions about his taxes and tax returns “very small-minded,” which is an interesting way to characterize the 63 percent of Americans who believe he needs to release more of his tax returns. Even the Obama campaign sought to offer Romney a way out on the issue, offering to stop attacking him on the issue of tax return secrecy if he’d just release five years of tax returns. This period would cover only the period when he’s been running for president, 2007-2011. The Romney campaign almost immediately refused the deal. BOTTOM LINE: What is so damning in Mitt Romney’s hidden tax returns that he refuses to reveal them? It’s time for Mitt Romney to come clean with the American people and release more of his tax returns.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345391259000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 11:47:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345391975000-19</Id><Title>Guess what changed?</Title><Msg>"WASHINGTON - When Congressman Paul Ryan has been asked the past few years about the value of stimulus to the sagging economy and the nation's jobless, the Wisconsin Republican has dismissed it as meaningless, and dubbed it "sugar-high economics." But that's when President Obama is pushing for the spending. When it was President George W. Bush arguing for more stimulus to boost a slow economy in the early 2000s, Ryan's economic analysis was entirely different. "What we're trying to accomplish today with the passage of this third stimulus package is to create jobs and help the unemployed," Ryan said, in comments unearthed by MSNBC's "Up with Chris Hayes" and provided to HuffPost. "What we're trying to accomplish is to pass the kinds of legislation that when they've passed in the past have grown the economy and gotten people back to work." Video of the comments will be aired at 8:00 a.m. Sunday on MSNBC.

As long as the 1% pay 44% of all government revenues then other taxpayers, all on down the line, have no REASON to care about increases in costs of government since about half of "taxpayers" pay no taxes at all, or even get negative taxes (e.g. paid by the government for reproducing). Why care about the stability and long term viability of an organization in which you have no stake? Why care if it borrows more than more money to cover gaps in the declining middle class tax receipts, as the middle class increasingly shrinks into the part of the population paying no taxes at all? The people have figured out they can vote themselves bread and circus performances, if a session of Congress can be called anything else today, and so our only HOPE of sustaining what little we have left IS to create gridlock in Congress when it comes to any unsustainable or unfunded budget proposal, and THIS is what they've been doing. A government so locked up it can do nothing is preferable to a government that continues to dig itself deeper and deeper into a hole it's already going to take us a century and a half to get out of even if we start trying to pay it off within the next 4 fiscal years. People have to learn that if they want their own bread they're going to have to learn to grow, thresh, grind, and bake it, and if they want entertainment well, that doesn't necessarily have to mean having a 24" fishing boat you use maybe 6 times a year. Sure, tax the rich, those who actually earn income based on labor at unmentionable hourly rates, or work product that earns at rates all out of proportion to the effort involved. But on those that risk their own money, earned and already taxed, to support the creation of new business or investing in existing businesses that wish to expand, or buying into established businesses to have a piece of the rock and earn dividends (treated as income) to pay for your later years. That money should be left alone.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1345393508000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 12:25:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345396334000-21</Id><Title>Want the same results?</Title><Msg>Elect the same guy.

This time last year it wad estimated that etfc had $2.3-2.5 billion in charge offs. Its just about there, and for acquisition purposes it is there as the company has reserved over $500,000,000 for additional losses. Biding time and not officially putting the company on the market will allow for only unsolicited offers. And that is the subplot.

But their meaning was mangled by FDR when he pushed his New Deal through. Social Security was CALLED a tax to justify mandatory contribution into SS system. There was no constitutional base to force people making contributions into their own retirement. It was presented to people as trust fund, but collected as tax. Obamacare mimics that with mandatory purchase of health coverage. The only difference is individual has to shop around and make a purchase. The common end: it has to go through IRS. FICA tax reduction cuts the throat of SS program. Pure and simple. This kind of proposition would never come out of Republican administration because it defeats SS purpose. Liberal media would present it as thievery and justifiably so. But not under Obama administration. In 2011, it was deceitfully called payroll tax cut, so people wouldn’t know their trust fund is getting depleted. FICA is not a tax. It is contribution to individual's retirement. Your comparison has no merit.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1345401314000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 14:35:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345401992000-27</Id><Title>Time for funds to rethink positions?</Title><Msg>This could be devastating to the share.

Romney, a former private equity executive who is one of the richest men ever to run for president, has come under pressure for months from the Obama campaign to release more years of tax returns. He has released his 2010 tax return and estimates for 2011 but does not plan to reveal more years of returns. In April, he requested an extension from the Internal Revenue Service to file his 2011 tax forms, while estimating his tax liability at $3.2 million for last year. Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney adviser, indicated the former Massachusetts governor would release the 2011 return by October 15, about three weeks before the November 6 election, but refused to say exactly when. "Look, October 15 is the deadline for the IRS on an extension. We have said as soon as they're ready we're going to release them. And I believe they'll be ready before that," Gillespie told the "Fox News Sunday" program.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345419392000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 19:36:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345419675000-44</Id><Title>GOP admits racist voter suppression</Title><Msg>Doug Priesse: Ohio Early Voting Process Should Not Accommodate Black Voters Source: Huffington Post An Ohio GOP election official who voted against the weekend voting rules that enabled thousands to cast ballots in the 2008 election said Sunday that he did not think that the state's early voting procedures should accommodate African-Americans.

But you can have a lot of economic income that isn’t taxable and Romney has shown himself to be quite sophisticated in keeping his taxable income low even as his economic income remains high. “He’s got interests in a lot of different investment stocks, and he can basically choose when he wants to recognize income from those funds. So he can use capital losses to offset capital gains and keep his taxable income low.” * * * “When you have a wide portfolio of investments, you can have a good year, but still not have a lot of taxable income, as long as you sell some losers as well as some winners,” Fleischer explained to FOX31 Denver. “That appears to be what Romney did in 2009, paid tax on whatever income he had, but it doesn’t mean he paid a lot.” Read more: http://kdvr.com/2012/08/16/romney-on-taxes-ive-paid-at-least-13-percent/ I think this may explain why the Obama campaign has dared the Romney campaign to just produce three more years of returns even though five years of return is still far below the norm for a Presidential candidate. Romney may say he paid a 13 percent tax rate, but he is not saying that is his effective tax rate. Also, if he claimed a lot of losses, he might only be paying a tax rate on a nominal amount of reported income, thus rendering his effective tax rate close to zero.

"We had buses at every church that Sunday," recalled the Rev. Emmitt Theophilus Caviness, the 83-year-old pastor of Cleveland's Greater Abyssinia Baptist Church. "As soon as we left church, we got on the bus and went down to vote." At the board of elections office, Caviness told HuffPost, "you would have seen long lines wrapped around corners. People were enthusiastic. They were having fun." It was a first in so many ways. But one of the most important of those ways was the new Ohio law that allowed voting on a Sunday. "It never would have happened had we not had early voting -- the opportunity on the last weekend to participate in democracy," Caviness said.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345425603000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 21:20:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345425712000-49</Id><Topic><Title>GOP admits racist voter suppression</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345419675000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 19:41:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Four years earlier, the November election in Ohio was a debacle. Shortages of voting machines in some minority neighborhoods led to thousands of voters giving up their franchise rather than waiting for as long as 10 hours for their turn. Other votes went uncounted. In response, Ohio's legislature established early in-person voting, supplementing traditional Election Day voting and mail-in absentee ballots. Voters would now have 35 days before the election to cast ballots, including that final weekend. In 2008, some 93,000 Ohioans -- including the members of the Greater Abyssinia Baptist Church -- cast votes during those last three days before the election. But early voting was apparently too much of a success for some people. In Ohio and four other states -- Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and West Virginia -- Republican-led legislatures have dramatically reduced early voting in 2012 as part of what can only be explained as a concerted effort to suppress the votes of Democratic-leaning voters. Other parts of that effort include voter ID bils, intimidation of voter registration groups and the purges of voter rolls. In Ohio and Florida, two of the most critical swing states in this year's presidential election, the GOP early voting rollback specifically included a ban on voting on the Sunday before Election Day. Early voting started off a wildly popular, bipartisan element of voting reform. Indeed, of all the voting reforms this country has seen over the last decades, early voting is easily the most unassailable. It makes voting more convenient for the public and makes Election Day easier for election officials. Because it generally happens at board of elections offices, it takes notoriously unreliable volunteer poll workers out of the picture. But Republican leaders cooled on the idea after 2008. "It just so happened that this was the first time that early voting had been used in large numbers to mobilize African American and Latino voters," said Wendy Weiser, who directs the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345425712000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 21:21:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345425772000-50</Id><Topic><Title>GOP admits racist voter suppression</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345419675000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 19:41:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>After the GOP won control of many statehouses in 2010, rolling back early voting became a top legislative priority. That meant reducing the period for early in-person voting in Florida from 14 to 8 days, and in Ohio, from 35 to 11. And no voting on Sunday before the election. "I try to be an objective observer," said professor Paul Gronke, who runs the nonpartisan Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Oregon. "But the objective facts indicate there seem to be partisan motivations behind the ratcheting back of early in-person voting." Research by an Ohio voter advocacy group found that blacks made up more than half the early in-person voters in 2008, compared with about a quarter of people who vote on Election Day or by mail. Research by political scientists at Dartmouth College and the University of Florida concluded that "Democratic, African American, Hispanic, younger, and first-time voters were disproportionately likely to vote early in 2008 and in particular on weekends, including the final Sunday of early voting." "We should be increasing access to vote, not taking it away," said Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a Cleveland Democrat. "You got a lot of working people, working-class folks, some people have to piece together three to four jobs, why wouldn't we have extended hours and extended days?" The question ultimately answers itself. "For me, this is Jim Crow in the 21st century," Turner said. "Jim Crow has been resurrected. This is by design. It's not by accident." Republican explanations for rolling back early voting include unsupported suggestions of voter fraud. Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, said in a newspaper op-ed that his goal "has been to balance access and accuracy," and that he was simply trying to establish "a uniform system across the state" with the early voting rules. But Pastor Caviness said he thinks Republicans were intimidated by seeing all those African-American churchgoers headed to vote -- "Souls to Polls" is what the black churches called it. "That seems to be the tenor and tune of where they're coming from," Caviness said. "Otherwise, why would you deny people the basic right to participate in democracy?" In Ohio's heavily Democratic cities -- Cleveland, Columbus, Akron and Toledo -- early voting will be limited to working hours on weekdays in 2012. But, as the Cincinnati Enquirer reported recently, attempts to add extended hours at the local election boards have been blocked by Republicans in urban counties, "even as extended hours will be available in some smaller counties with a strong Republican slant." The reason, as Ari Berman explained in the Nation, is that county boards of election in Ohio have two members from each party. Ties are broken by the secretary of state. In solidly Republican counties, GOP election commissioners have approved expanded early voting hours -- because why not? But in Democratic counties, they've balked. And Husted, the man who said he supports the law because it will bring uniformity to the state, has backed them up.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345425772000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 21:22:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345425810000-51</Id><Topic><Title>GOP admits racist voter suppression</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345419675000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 19:41:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The early voting changes in both Florida and Ohio face legal challenges. Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the reduction, which she argued is discriminatory. And President Barack Obama's campaign sued Husted last month, asking a federal court to restore voting during the last three days before the election on the grounds that the law grants unequal treatment to military families, who are allowed later polling access than other Ohio voters. The Romney campaign tried to cast Obama's action as an attack on military voting rights. That claim, which a member of the New York Times editorial board termed "an extraordinary lie" -- was initially accepted stenographically by some political journalists, and spread like wildfire on social networks, before crumbling under the weight of its own mendacity. Matt McClellan, Husted's press secretary, denied there was any partisan motivation behind the restriction in early voting. "The boards of election had requested that to have more opportunity to prepare for Election Day," McClellan told the Huffington Post. The Ohio Association of Election Officials "asked for it." But Llyn McCoy, president of the election officials' group, disagreed: "I wouldn't say that we came out and started this," she said. The election officials' group was asked to weigh in on the idea, McCoy said -- and it did end up voting in favor of reducing early voting days. But it was hardly unanimous. "It was a close vote," she said. The biggest split was between officials from rural counties, who didn't feel the need for extended hours, and those from urban counties, who felt it strongly. McCoy, deputy director of the board of elections in Greene County, a mostly Republican county outside Dayton, was nevertheless among the officials who argued in favor of voting during that final weekend. "By and large, election officials, it's our job to make it easier for people to vote, not harder," she said. "That's where a lot of us came down." People who follow the history of voting rights are amazed at the sudden turnaround in what had seemed irreversible momentum toward greater access to the ballot. "We haven't seen a period of constricting the franchise like this since Jim Crow," Weiser said. "It really runs contrary to the American narrative." Turner, the state senator from Cleveland, called it "pure racism." "It's racist, it's sexist and it's classist," Turner said. "It's just flat-out un-American."</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345425810000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 21:23:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345428323000-52</Id><Title>For fans of socialized medicine</Title><Msg>http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0501.longman.html</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345428323000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 22:05:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345428683000-53</Id><Topic><Title>What a day!</Title><Username>trulaoiw191</Username><Timestamp>1345397807000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 13:36:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ur timing is simply best</Msg><Username>leiatsi945</Username><Timestamp>1345428683000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 22:11:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345428736000-54</Id><Title>Mossad has the photos</Title><Msg>GOP frolic in SOG: http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=23759F8B-A9C0-46FD-8340-A36018E823D1</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1345428736000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 22:12:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345430018000-55</Id><Topic><Title>OMG!!!
