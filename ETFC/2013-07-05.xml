In a discussion on CNN’s Erin Burnett OutFront about use of the “N Word” in America, former Reading Rainbow host Levar Burton explains his protocol for handling a police stop to avoid violence: Listen, I’m gonna be honest with you, and this is a practice I engage in every time I’m stopped by law enforcement. And I taught this to my son who is now 33 as part of my duty as a father to ensure that he knows the kind of world in which he is growing up. So when I get stopped by the police, I take my hat off and my sunglasses off, I put them on the passenger’s side, I roll down my window, I take my hands, I stick them outside the window and on the door of the driver’s side because I want that officer to be relaxed as possible when he approaches my vehicle. And I do that because I live in America. CNN’s Don Lemon recounts similar experiences, with people often stopping him on the street in Louisiana to ask, “Where’d you get that car, #$%$? Whose car is this?” He recounted one experience driving with a white friend who said after a police stop that he’s never had the police deal with him like that. “I’m like hello, welcome to my life,” Lemon said.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1373001123815</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 01:12:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373001213148-8</Id><Topic><Title>Profiling</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1373001123815</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 01:12:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Author Tim Wise, who is white, describes an entirely different reality. He recounts a day living in Louisiana when he locked himself out of his car and the police offered to help him break in: One day I locked myself out of my car on Roberts Street and so I’m trying to break into my car with a coat hanger and a cop comes up. And he sees me doing it. He does not even ask me for ID or proof that that’s my car. Literally, the NOPD was like, hey you’re breaking into the car the wrong way. Let me help you. The cop was trying to help me break in. Now there is not a black man in this country 23 [years old] for whom that would’ve been the reaction. These anecdotes are reflected in national statistics. A 2007 study by the Department of Justice found that blacks and Hispanics were about three times as likely to be searched during a traffic stop. Blacks are also twice as likely to be arrested and nearly four times as likely to experience the threat or use of force during interactions with the police. In 2011, the New York Police department made more stops of young black men than the entire population of young black men in New York City. And while police stops continue overwhelmingly against blacks and Hispanics, stops of these minorities are half as likely to garner weapons, compared to stops of whites. Just last week, the Department of Justice released a two-year investigation of the Los Angeles County Sherriff’s Department that reveals egregious and disproportionate police targeting of blacks and Hispanics. This racially skewed policing starts early with high rates of suspension and disciplinary infraction arrests among school children, and ends with 1 in 15 black men in prison – many of whom have disproportionately longer sentences.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1373001213148</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 01:13:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373032041745-9</Id><Title>Hey Shorty - Run</Title><Msg>for the exits.</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1373032041745</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:47:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373032151243-10</Id><Title>Hey Shorty - Where's Little Lord Fauntleroy</Title><Msg>when you need him?</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1373032151243</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:49:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373032275877-11</Id><Title>Hey Shorty - Why'd you think it was a good idea to go short?</Title><Msg>when Little Lord Fauntleroy dumped all his shares?

Schwab is pretty much valued out . . . that is, all that's in there is already priced into the stock. eTrade has some "look what I pull out of my hat" potential even yet. Schwab, not so much. I want to maximize my returns and I'm willing to accept alittle more risk to do it. Schwab is for guys who have absolutely no imagination. No drive to reach for the value HIDDEN in the balance sheets rather than hoping for growth in an already competitive industry. So no matter WHAT Schwab does in the short term, in the long term the batter value is most probably in ETrade instead. Investing in Schwab is a "last year" thing to do. Now it's so overvalued that the only sane thing to do with it is short it. Meanwhile ETrade remains a good longer term position.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1373050762780</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 14:59:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373051087486-34</Id><Topic><Title>Big Trouble for Zimmer</Title><Username>methuserlaw</Username><Timestamp>1372914101646</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 01:01:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've watched snippets of the trial and the so called witnesses for the prosecution have done more to exonerate Mr ZimmerMAN than all the fluff pieces the press has done on this "Darling Boy" Trayvon combined have done to incriminate him.

(AP) -- Gov. Scott Walker quietly signed a contentious Republican bill Friday that would require women seeking abortions to undergo an ultrasound and ban doctors who lack admitting privileges at nearby hospitals from performing the procedures. Opponents contend legislators shouldn't force women to undergo any medical procedure and the bill will force at least two abortion clinics where providers lack admitting privileges to shut their doors. The Republican-controlled Legislature passed the bill in mid-June. Walker, a Republican, could have chosen to sign it at any time since then but decided to do it on Friday in the middle of the long 4th of July holiday weekend. The measure's opponents accused him of trying to bury news of the signing. "That's his prerogative. He's the governor," said Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin attorney Lester Pines.
