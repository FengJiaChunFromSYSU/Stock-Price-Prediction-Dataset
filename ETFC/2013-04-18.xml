Paul Kevin Curtis, 45, was arrested Wednesday at his home in Corinth, near the Tennessee state line about 50 miles north of Presley’s birthplace in Tupelo. ... Curtis wrote that he was trying to “expose various parties within the government, FBI, police departments” for what he believed was “a conspiracy to ruin my reputation in the community as well as an ongoing effort to break down the foundation I worked more than 20 years to build in the country music scene.” ... The FBI said there was no indication of a connection between the letters and the Monday bombing in Boston that killed three people and injured more than 170.

Before they could act, her fellows were killed in the townhouse explosion.** A Tale of Two Terrorists Somewhere near Boston early Monday morning, he packed a bomb in a bag. It was by all accounts relatively crude — a pressure cooker, explosives, some wires, ball bearings and nails . . . nails which, hours later, doctors would struggle to remove from the flesh of bleeding victims. His motive is unclear. His intent is not: It was to maximize injury, suffering, pain, trauma and, yes, death. Perhaps Monday’s bomber will be caught, perhaps not. Perhaps Monday’s bomber will be offered a teaching job at Columbia University. Forty-three years ago last month, Kathy Boudin, now a professor at Columbia but then a member of the Weather Underground, escaped an explosion at a bomb factory operated in a townhouse in Greenwich Village. Three weeks earlier, Boudin’s Weathermen had firebombed a private home in Upper Manhattan with Molotov cocktails. The rest of the family, was presumably, an afterthought. I was 9 at the time, only a year older than the youngest victim in Boston. One of Boudin’s colleagues, Cathy Wilkerson, related in her memoir that the Weathermen were disappointed with the minimal effects of the bombs at my home. They decided to use dynamite the next time and bought a large quantity along with fuses, metal pipes and, yes, nails. The group designated as its next target a dance at an Officer’s Club at Fort Dix, NJ. Despite the misgivings of some, it is reported that Kathy Boudin urged the use of “anti-personnel bombs.” In other words, she wanted to kill people not just damage property. Before they could act, her fellows were killed in the townhouse explosion.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1366314728365</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 15:52:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366316284250-40</Id><Topic><Title>Estimates?</Title><Username>briguy260</Username><Timestamp>1366229594527</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 16:13:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>420 mil in rev and .12 on eps.
