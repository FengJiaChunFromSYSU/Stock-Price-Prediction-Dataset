Thanks to Obama’s support among women, the survey of likely voters by Quinnipiac University shows the incumbent holding a 49 percent to 45 percent edge over Romney. Obama leads by 56 percent to 38 percent among women. Romney leads among men, 52 percent to 42 percent. Independent voters are divided, with 47 percent backing Romney and 45 percent Obama, within a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. Obama was favored similarly among women four years ago, while Romney is faring better among men than the 2008 Republican nominee, Arizona Senator John McCain, polls showed. Quinnipiac showed Obama with a 14-point lead, 54 percent to 40 percent, among likely women voters in a Sept. 11-16, 2008, poll, as McCain led among men, 50 percent to 43 percent. And a Pew Research Center poll of registered voters taken Sept. 27-29 put Obama ahead among women, 54 percent to 37 percent, while McCain led among men, 47 percent to 43 percent.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349239527314</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 00:45:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349248036999-3</Id><Topic><Title>Looks Like ETFC Is On The Verge Of A Massive Up Trend</Title><Username>schultzbarker721</Username><Timestamp>1349179662692</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 08:07:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everybody knows that.

One of the most effective parts of Dodd-Frank is the CFPB -- thank you, Elizabeth Warren! Today the CFPB announced that they have ordered American Express to pay $85 million in restitution to customers who were harmed by illegal credit card practices along with a $27.5 million dollar civil penalty. Amex was very naughty, it seems. According to the CFPB, these were a few of their sins: Deceived consumers who signed up for the American Express “Blue Sky” credit card program: Consumers were sometimes led to believe they would receive $300 in addition to bonus points if they signed up for this American Express Centurion Bank program. But consumers who met the qualifications did not receive the $300. This violates federal laws prohibiting deceptive practices. Charged unlawful late fees: American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB billed late fees on certain cards based on a percentage of the debt in violation of the Credit CARD Act. Unlawfully discriminated against new account applicants on the basis of age: American Express Centurion Bank used a credit scoring system that treated charge card applicants differently on the basis of age. For a period of time, the bank did not fully implement the system for applicants over the age of 35. This violated the Equal Credit Opportunity Act because it requires credit scoring systems that take age into account to be properly designed and implemented. Failed to report consumer disputes to consumer reporting agencies: American Express Centurion Bank and American Express Bank, FSB failed to report the existence of certain customer disputes to credit bureaus, which is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Misled consumers about debt collection: All three of the American Express subsidiaries deceived consumers into believing there were certain benefits to paying off old debt. Consumers were wrongly told that if they paid off the old debt, the payment would be reported to credit bureaus and could improve their credit scores. In fact, American Express was not reporting the payments and the debts were so old that even if they had tried to report them, many of the payments would not have appeared on these consumers’ credit reports or affected their credit scores. American Express also told some consumers that a portion of their debt would be waived or forgiven if they accepted certain settlement offers. But for customers who applied for a new American Express card, the company was not really forgiving or waiving the debt. To remedy this, Amex will pay customers the $300 they never received as a credit to their account, late fees charged improperly will be refunded, and remedies to those customers misled into thinking their debt would be forgiven will be put in place. To me, what is most remarkable about this is the speed with which it has come about since it was transferred to the CFPB last year. Instead of it dragging on and on and lingering while it was litigated in some kind of class action lawsuit, the CFPB was able to get a settlement that fully restores people's accounts with a check or a credit, and agreement that future credit activities will be audited and monitored by the CFPB. A round of applause to the CFPB and hopes for more monitoring of credit card companies. Of all the different kinds of consumer credit, credit card issuers get away with more and manage to grab more in fees and unwarranted, often usury, charges than any other financial "institution." They should start with Capital One, since they seem to be the ones most often complained against.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1349276088819</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 10:54:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349278176547-13</Id><Title>Will Mittens talk to the USA like he did to the wealthy in private denounce half of Americans as moochers?</Title><Msg>Mittens has two faces , the real Mittens only comes out only among the wealthy and all white private gatherings such as the one where he lied about the 47% to expresse his hatred of half of Americans.</Msg><Username>hydroponicoctopus</Username><Timestamp>1349278176547</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:29:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349278280141-14</Id><Topic><Title>President Romney WINS in Landslide!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1348835996084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 08:39:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Muslim call to prayer is "The most beautiful sound in the world," according to Baraka Husseini Obomba</Msg><Username>leftie_weezner</Username><Timestamp>1349278280141</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:31:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349278380710-15</Id><Topic><Title>President Romney WINS in Landslide!!!</Title><Username>q4bike</Username><Timestamp>1348835996084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-28 08:39:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>slayer honey, are you dreaming again?</Msg><Username>bami2012</Username><Timestamp>1349278380710</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:33:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349278660628-16</Id><Title>Akin-stereotypical GOP drooling idiot</Title><Msg>"Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin sparked national outrage in August when he justified his opposition to abortion by claiming that victims of "legitimate rape" rarely get pregnant because "the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down." However, the Republican congressman's now-infamous remarks are not the first time he's made a scientifically questionable statement on abortion. As Slate's Amanda Marcotte reported Tuesday, Akin gave a speech on the House floor in 2008 denouncing abortion providers as "terrorists," claiming that they sometimes perform abortions on women who "are not actually pregnant": "It is no big surprise that we fight the terrorists because they are fundamentally un-American, and yet we have terrorists in our own culture called abortionists. One of the good pieces of news why we are winning this war is because there are not enough heartless doctors being graduated from medical schools. There is a real shortage of abortionists. Who wants to be at the very bottom of the food chain of medical profession? And what sort of places do these bottom-of-the-food-chain doctors work in? Places that are really a pit. You find that along with the culture of death go all kinds of other law-breaking: not following good sanitary procedure, giving abortions to women who are not actually pregnant, cheating on taxes, all these kinds of things, misuse of anesthetics so that people die or almost die." Akin's allegation of doctors performing abortions on non-pregnant women is particularly puzzling, since, by definition, an abortion cannot be performed if there is no pregnancy to terminate. Akin, a member of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, also gave a speech in 2005 on stem cell research, expressing his concern that a science-fiction story his daughter wrote about humans being harvested for body parts could become reality. "Oppose public funding that destroys little yous and mes, and oppose this harvest of destruction," he urged his congressional colleagues considering a stem cell research bill. Despite the overwhelming backlash to Akin's "legitimate rape" claim, the Republican has a good chance of beating incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) in next month's election. The latest polling shows Akin with a lead of one percentage point over McCaskill, and a number of Republicans, including Rick Santorum, Jim DeMint and Newt Gingrich, have come out in support of Akin in recent weeks."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1349278660628</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 11:37:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349280896604-17</Id><Title>ATTD distribution agreement announcement, 2200% GAINS POSSIBLE ,READ</Title><Msg>DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT ANNONCEMENT WITH WALMART STORES ANY DAY NOW.

The man's a douche and its about time he was exposed as such. 90 billion on green jobs?? CMON Brak you can do better than that!</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1349318685527</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 22:44:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349318805931-34</Id><Topic><Title>WOW!...CNN, ABC, Declare Romney the Winner!...</Title><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1349318683329</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 22:44:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stick a fork in 'eeem Brak looked like a beaten man up there..
