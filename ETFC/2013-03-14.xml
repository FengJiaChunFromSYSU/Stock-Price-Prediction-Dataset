Try almost every branch of ACORN they tried, I don't recall them mentioning ANY that said "get out". For a period of 4 months they released one interview about every three weeks. ACORN tried like mad via warnings and other things to shut their staff up, but the interviews had already been done, and so they did ANOTHER set of videos based on the warnings ACORN members got. Eventually the net of the damage was SO bad Congress cut off funding to ACORN, by name, and by ASSOCIATION, making it a crime to supply them with federal funds. Now, if what I said were false, would they have lost their funding?</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1363234823890</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 00:20:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363234925641-2</Id><Topic><Title>The crooks pumped the price knowing about the 10% dillution</Title><Username>huj_on_u</Username><Timestamp>1363228246387</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-13 22:30:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ignore the stupid short, he's losing his "anti-investment" and probably wishes he put it into something worthless instead of a security backed by billions of dollars of undervalued real-estate assets.

However those shares will have a slight temporary damping effect on the price, but only a temporary one. Citadel was getting rid of its shares, I just hope that they aren't allowed to buy back in for a reasonable period of they could continue this "acquire over time and dump" technique to keep the stock price down until they can arrange to steal it. If they SEC "permission to acquire" isn't expired we could see them just waiting around for a price dip to load up again a buck or so cheaper so they can rinse, wash, repeat as long as the stupid people keep selling their stock. This is a no brainer holder to $13+, with the strong possibility of making it over $20 within a year. If you don't have any yet, be sure to buy some soon, and if you're a short, be sure to cover today as this will likely be the lowest price you'll see on this stock in while this morning, and then its likely just back off to the races.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1363265248389</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 08:47:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363266066043-10</Id><Topic><Title>Another win for ACORN</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363101289881</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 11:14:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Breaking the law? Lying? Cheating? Extortion?" Wow, you were paying attention during the Clinton administration! Don't forget murder, conspiracy to commit murder, obstruction of justice, perjury (Billy only lost his law license over that one instead of going to jail for 5 years which is where he SHOULD have gone), extortion, witness intimidation . . . well you get the idea. What did Bush do? Give me examples? I certainly remember specific examples for Clinton [(Hillary with her Cattle Future or Else), Cheating (with a Whitehouse Intern), or Lying (perjury in a civil suit, how tacky)] . . . further his pimping on for a constituent to make a key part for military helicopters turned into a disaster when they started shipping castings instead of parts made from milled high quality metals, a bit of corruption that in 1993 killed my favorite former commanding officer, then Mag. Gen. Jarrett J. Robertson, the finest officer I ever served with. Plus his idiotic foreign policies. OBL declares war on the US so Clinton throws away $25 million in cruise missiles destroying a freaking aspirin factory . . . then #$%$ away even more Tomahawks on empty AQ training sites, called off a mission to do a hard hit because he was "worried about public opinion" . . . well guess a what Billy the C . . . you didn't seem to display the omniscience that people EXPECTED of Bush, yet no one said a word, at least in the mainstream media. Breaking the law, lying, cheating, it's all good for the DNC, after all they can expect that it won't appear in the New York Times or CNN or MSNBC or CBS or . . . well, you get the idea. Only people that actually READ will notice, and the DNC already knows that excludes all their constituents who might actually waver (Union members) if they knew what the DNC actually stood for.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1363266066043</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 09:01:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363266218813-11</Id><Topic><Title>Another win for ACORN</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1363101289881</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-12 11:14:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are just a bigot and a liar &amp; totally lame , you say "I don't recall ".... jeez,, recall from what,, the fraudulent bs video ...... the fact is, only one employee seemed to go along with the fake reporter and they may have well just been stringing him along while the police were summoned...... you are definately the type of bigot who judges all by one (and the one even on a fake and incomplete report).... so all catholic preists are child rapists and all US miliary are murderers of innocents, rapists and torturers, right?</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1363266218813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 09:03:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363266490321-12</Id><Title>one question</Title><Msg>who did they sell to?</Msg><Username>pebble_ubetcha</Username><Timestamp>1363266490321</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 09:08:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363266504899-13</Id><Topic><Title>10% sold in a flash, at a price the stock sold for EARLY YESTERDAY!</Title><Username>equityman2002</Username><Timestamp>1363264200403</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 08:30:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>post the facts not just your hearsay!!!! citadel will stab the investors again when they can , it's what they do. just remember etrade never fails to dissappoint!!! always!

Let's say a company decided to sell $100 bills for $50. They could claim HUGE revenue, but have HUGE losses. Now, if they changed their price to $105 for a $100 bill, their revenue would tank, they wouldn't have losses anymore, and according to the stock market's philosophy on revenue that would be a terrible terrible business move because look what it did to revenue. (Whereas the common sense way of looking at it is 'who's the moron paying $105 for a $100 bill? I don't know, but it's sure a lot better to have that $5 profit and a fraction of the revenue than it was to have a huge amount of revenue and huge losses.') Etrade revenue is down because the loans (you know, the thing that was causing huge losses) are running off. That's not a surprise, it's not like it's unexpected. As the losses decrease so does the revenue that was coming from the loans.

Right now if they have a run rate of 420 revenue and 320 mil in expenses (that aren't related to loan losses) the most they can earn is 100 mil pre-tax. A couple of years ago their revenue was over 600 mil and about 350 mil in expense (not including loan losses) so they could of earned 250+ mil pre-tax. Thats a significant contraction of their potential earnings power, and its still decreasing as more loans earning 4% run off and are replaced with other assets earning 1%.

The war has killed at least 134,000 Iraqi civilians and may have contributed to the deaths of as many as four times that number, according to the Costs of War Project by the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University. When security forces, insurgents, journalists and humanitarian workers were included, the war's death toll rose to an estimated 176,000 to 189,000, the study said.

I guess this guy took Bidens' Advice!.... Thu Mar 14, 2013 4:18pm EDT (Reuters) - Authorities on Thursday killed a man suspected of shooting dead four people a day earlier in separate incidents at a barbershop and a car wash in neighboring upstate New York towns, police said. The suspected gunman, identified as Kurt Myers, 64, was killed in a shootout with police and FBI agents at a building in Herkimer, New York, where he had barricaded himself the previous day, New York State Police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico said. As the authorities entered the first floor of the abandoned building, the gunman, described as a loner, opened fire on them, striking and killing an FBI police dog, D'Amico said. The gunman was then shot and killed. "He engaged them almost immediately," D'Amico said at a press conference. "It all took place shortly before 8 a.m. this morning, and it all unfolded and concluded in a matter of minutes. We know he had the shotgun with him that he used in yesterday's attacks." Four people were killed and two others critically injured in the shootings on Wednesday in the sleepy New York villages of Herkimer and Mohawk, which face one another across the Mohawk River. The villages are about 220 miles northwest of New York City. Police said they did not know of a motive behind the shooting sprees. "The violence that was inflicted yesterday on these victims was horrible," D'Amico said. Shortly before 9:30 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, Myers drove to John's Barber Shop in Mohawk, and after a brief exchange of words inside the shop, he opened fire with a shotgun, according to police. Two customers were killed, and the owner and another customer were critically wounded, D'Amico said. They remained in critical condition on Thursday, he said. "Totally unprovoked, we believe he fired a number of rounds from the shotgun," he said on Wednesday. Myers then drove to Gaffey's Fast Lube in the neighboring Herkimer, and fired again, D'Amico said, killing two people. State police in military garb and using an armored vehicle surrounded an abandoned building in the downtown section of Herkimer, a town of 7,700 people, on Wednesday afternoon. Shots were fired from inside the building and police returned fire. Myers' arrest record includes a drunken driving charge in 1973, police said. The killings took place shortly after a fire was reported at the Mohawk apartment house where Myers lived, said Mohawk Mayor James Baron. A search of the apartment turned up a cache of guns and ammunition, according to officials. In January Cuomo signed into law one of the country's toughest gun control measures, the first enacted in the wake of the mass shooting in December that killed 20 students and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. The law expands the state's ban on assault weapons, puts limits on ammunition capacity and has new measures to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. It also mandates a life sentence without parole for anyone who murders a first responder. Those killed in the car wash shooting were identified as Thomas Stefka, an employee at Gaffey's, and Michael Renshaw, a 20-year employee of the New York State Corrections Department, state police said. The barbershop victims were Harry Montgomery, 68, of Mohawk, and Michael Rancier, 57, of Herkimer. The shop owner, John Seymour, and a customer, Dan Haslauer, were rushed to St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Utica in critical condition, state police said. The two towns are located about midway between Albany, the state capital, and Syracuse.</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1363301928719</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 18:58:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363302413687-95</Id><Title>Ken Griffin decision to exit Etrade</Title><Msg>I see this as a positive move for Etrade.

In addition to the entirely apt uproar on the left about the cruelty of his cuts and the dodginess of his reasoning, Ryan took an unusual amount of flak from the right. The Heritage Foundation grumbled that Ryan had preserved Obama’s tax increases, while Larry Kudlow, CNBC’s resident supply-side evangelist, used an interview with Ryan to highlight his accounting gimmicks. But the unkindest cut of all came from the mainstream political press, which, even after Ryan’s failed vice presidential bid, was still touting him as the Republican Party’s intellectual leader, and very likely its future. Alas, the reverence was distinctly lacking on Tuesday. The New York Times’ lead story on Ryan framed his budget as an exercise in cynicism, pointing out up high that it would cut the deficit “largely by rolling back President Obama’s legislative accomplishments while also taking advantage of the savings they created.” 1 NBC’s Chuck Todd, the dean of White House political analysts, came right out and dropped the c-word explicitly: “[Ryan] cynically assumes ObamaCare’s $716 billion in Medicare cuts as a way to balance the budget in 10 years (despite Ryan saying he and Romney would restore those cuts during the campaign).” Todd went on to block-quote a now-embarrassing riff from Ryan’s convention speech. Which is to say, in one fell swoop, Ryan has done to himself what he never accomplished through years of fiscal lunacy (this is his third high-profile budget; none has lingered for very long on planet Earth) and months of campaign-trail dishonesty (Ryan’s convention speech contained lie after lie after lie): He’s made it hard for political reporters to take him seriously.

He has long understood that you could push a Randian agenda of tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts for the poor and, so long as you affected a plainspoken Midwestern-ness, you’d still look like a stand-up guy. He discovered it was possible to command wonkish cred while spouting endless budgetary nonsense, so long as you coated it in the language of “baselines” and “tax exclusions.” As my former colleague Jonathan Chait has written, “Ryan has grasped that the aura of specificity he has cultivated paradoxically renders the specifics themselves irrelevant.” Above all, Ryan figured out that, in the heat of an election, the average political reporter wasn’t going to bust him for even the most brazen whoppers and policy-reversals. The stories, such as they were, would be ghettoized in the fact-checking precincts of the media establishment—not exactly a common destination for the average voter. If the policy controversies seeped into front-page stories, they would usually be cloaked in the he-said/she-said vernacular of false equivalence. Hence Ryan’s willingness during the campaign to attack Obama for “raiding” Medicare to the tune of $716 billion dollars, even though the budget he released earlier that year advocated the same thing. A typical Politico piece left the accusation of hypocrisy to an Obama spokesman—“Congressman Ryan knows that the $716 billion in Medicare savings that he included in two of his own budgets do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit”—where it could, of course, be easily dismissed. (In fairness, some outlets like the Times did note the change in position themselves, but tended to do it in passing, far down in their pieces.) But there’s one insight Ryan didn’t fully glean: You can treat politics like a game, and you can assume reporters will, too. But you can’t go so far as to admit it’s a game. During the campaign, Ryan never broke character. When pressed on Medicare, he and his handlers would simply double-down: “Having already saddled the country with $5 trillion in new debt while cutting Medicare by $716 billion to pay for 'Obamacare,' President Obama cannot defend his broken promises,” an aide told the Times last August, “so he and his campaign are resorting to tired and misleading attacks.” The problem with Ryan’s new budget—in which he reverts to his pre-campaign position on Medicare cuts—is that it more or less concedes the whole campaign, with its righteous defense of Medicare, was a charade. Among the Washington press corps, this is a major no-no. Depending on the circumstances, reporters may be happy to enable these reinventions, but they are loath to acknowledge their role in them. Ryan basically rubbed their noses in it. Even Politico, whose coverage most resembles ends-justifying scorekeeping, seemed to bridle at the transgression. The last five paragraphs of its main Ryan budget piece catalogued his history of Medicare flip-flops. The closing riff quoted a centrist budget wonk—the kind of person Ryan has made a career of courting—essentially outing him as full of it. There’s a lesson in here for pols on the make: You can commit all manner of policy sins. If you’re earnest and charming, you can even attack your opponents for ideas over which you share paternity. But do not—I repeat, do not—show up the political media. Hell hath no fury like my fellow hacks spurned.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1363305482994</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 19:58:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363305491699-101</Id><Topic><Title>Long Timers?</Title><Username>bugseypug</Username><Timestamp>1363290144163</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 15:42:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yup, been here since after the firstndrop from 25... then the RS 1/10... still holding as it does me no good as my shares are IRA money.. so it either goes big, sold off, or BK... anyway I am holding untill I'm 60.... that is still a long way off.</Msg><Username>lrng2sail</Username><Timestamp>1363305491699</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 19:58:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363305573021-102</Id><Topic><Title>As underwriter remember it'll be Citigroup's top priority to drive the price up after the 19th.</Title><Username>ualdayan</Username><Timestamp>1363284281026</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 14:04:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>total nonsense!! citadel will short the stock lower. they are probably one ones with the biggest short position then dumping their was the fire under thye pot!!!citadel sucks IMHO</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1363305573021</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 19:59:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363305845545-103</Id><Topic><Title>As underwriter remember it'll be Citigroup's top priority to drive the price up after the 19th.</Title><Username>ualdayan</Username><Timestamp>1363284281026</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 14:04:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Citadel sold 36million shares... yet we traded 54Million today..... hummm.

Last week, hundreds gathered at the south steps of the Texas State Capitol in Austin to protest the resulting public health mess: Researchers say nearly 200,000 Texas women have lost or could lose access to contraception, cancer screenings, and basic preventive care, especially in low-income, rural parts of the state. I reported from the rally: Given that anti-choice legislators in other states could draw inspiration from Texas's "winning" strategy to defund Planned Parenthood—several have tried and failed in recent years—it's worth surveying the damage. About a year after Texas slashed its family-planning budget by two-thirds, with 50 clinics shutting down as a result, the Texas Policy Evaluation Project surveyed 300 pregnant women seeking an abortion in Texas. Nearly half said they were "unable to access the birth control that they wanted to use" in the three months before they became pregnant. Among the reasons: cost, lack of insurance, inability to find a clinic, and inability get a prescription. The state's health commission says Texas will see nearly 24,000 unplanned births between 2014 and 2015 thanks to these cuts, raising state and federal taxpayer's Medicaid costs by up to $273 million.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363318698272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:38:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363318938900-118</Id><Topic><Title>What Happens When You Defund Planned Parenthood</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363318698272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:38:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In a state where half of all pregnancies were unplanned in 2011, and 1 in 3 women of childbearing age lacks health insurance, this is only going to get worse. The Planned Parenthood clinics that anti-choice legislators booted from the state's Women's Health Program serviced nearly 50 percent of the program's patients. Along with contraceptive counseling, the clinics provided basic screenings for cancer, hypertension, and other key problems. There's no shortage of need: women in Texas suffer high rates of STIs and unintended pregnancies compared to national figures, and the state ranks 50th for diabetes prevalence in women. Nonetheless, Republican lawmakers went after the clinics in 2011, thanks to their long-standing beef with the organization, and forfeited tens of millions in Medicaid reimbursements to the Women's Health Program so they could defund Planned Parenthood clinics without breaking any federal rules governing how states have to spend Medicaid money. Despite losing its highest-volume providers, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission insists the revamped, wholly state-run and state-funded Women's Health Program can reshuffle all the displaced patients and keep providing the same levels of care as before. But last October, researchers at George Washington University examined five Texas counties and found that in order to effectively replace Planned Parenthood, other clinics would need to increase their caseloads two to five times. That seems unlikely. The remaining clinics are already straining under these changes, according to a survey by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. More than a fifth have reduced their hours of operation, while others, like Planned Parenthood in East Austin, are staying shakily afloat on community donations. Instead of offering IUDs, a highly effective birth-control method with higher up-front costs to the provider, clinic staffers are now more likely to offer lower-cost birth control pill</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363318938900</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:42:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363319303786-119</Id><Topic><Title>What Happens When You Defund Planned Parenthood</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363318698272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:38:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Instead of offering IUDs, a highly effective birth-control method with higher up-front costs to the provider, clinic staffers are now more likely to offer lower-cost birth control pills. They also tend to give out fewer packs of pills per visit, making it harder for patients to be consistent. Others are seeing fewer patients or increasing their fees. Lone Star Circle of Care, for example, lost 62 percent of its Title X funding over the last year. Now it's charging more patients a $20 to $35 fee for an annual exam. That's still low, in part because Lone Star isn't affiliated with an abortion provider and therefore hasn't lost funding altogether. At Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas, on the other hand, the same exam can now cost nearly $100; before defunding, they were virtually free.

"If you put fees in place, even if they're pretty modest, patients just don't come in, or they don't come in as often," says Sarah Wheat, vice president for community affairs at Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. "We'll have patients who, if they had a high gas bill that month, or a high electricity bill, they'll think, 'Okay, well maybe next month I can go in.' Or they're going to say, 'Let me just get the gonorrhea test. I'll pay for the chlamydia test next time.'" It's hard to tell whether displaced patients are finding care elsewhere. After Hill Country Community Action announced it was closing its family planning clinics in the central Texas town of San Saba last summer, only a hundred or so of its 2,000 clients called to ask about other providers, the Texas Observer reports. Many of the remaining clinics in the area are charging new fees since the cuts, and none reported an uptick in new patients from San Saba, except for the Planned Parenthood in Waco.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363319303786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:48:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363319372906-120</Id><Topic><Title>What Happens When You Defund Planned Parenthood</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363318698272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:38:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Meanwhile, anti-choice legislators are touting these cuts as a way to wipe out the "abortion industry," but it turns out none of the 53 clinics that closed since September 2011 were providing abortions to begin with. None of the Planned Parenthood clinics formerly involved with the Women's Health Program provided abortions, either—Texas has never allowed abortion clinics to participate in WHP. And under the Hyde Amendment, public health providers can't use federal funding to administer abortions, anyway. "Ironically, this whole conversation is about abortion services, and yet clinics providing abortions in this state were untouched by these cuts," says Wheat. In 2011, there were about 70,000 abortions in Texas, a 10 percent drop from 2010. But it's too soon to know whether this is the result of the state slashing its family planning funds or other measures​, says Dan Grossman, vice president for research at Ibis Reproductive Health and a researcher at the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. What we do know, Grossman adds, is that most women showing up for abortions are not changing their minds after seeing their ultrasounds, as they're now required to do in Texas. It remains to be seen whether anti-choice lawmakers in other states will adopt Texas's costly strategy for defunding Planned Parenthood within their own borders. Since 2010, nine states have tried to cut family planning funds; Montana, New Hampshire, and New Jersey have slashed their family planning budgets by more than half. Seven have made it harder for clinics like Planned Parenthood to receive state or federal family planning grants. Last month, four Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin shut down in the face of cuts. Now with the Texas Legislature back in session, some state senators are proposing to add $100 million back into the state's primary care program, specifically for women's health services; and last week a Democratic legislator introduced a bill to reverse the Affiliate Ban Rule. But Wheat says these measures are unlikely to repair the damage of the past two years. "It's hard to put back together a system that's been dismantled," she said.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1363319372906</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:49:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363319717370-121</Id><Topic><Title>Top Analyst UPGRADES ETFC</Title><Username>browndrake513</Username><Timestamp>1363270784976</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 10:19:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SPAMMER !!</Msg><Username>daxwang</Username><Timestamp>1363319717370</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-14 23:55:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
