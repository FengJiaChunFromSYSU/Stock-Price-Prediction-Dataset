You know we DO have one in this nation, even if it hasn't been used since they tried to pass the ERA. The problem is that it's DESIGNED to be slow and deliberate so that the emotions of the moment don't cause us to throw away our freedom's, and so the body politic can engage in a wide debate before such a major change to our central governing document is made. Instead over the last 40 decades we've become like every other nation, throwing away the basics of our founding documents, from England ignoring the Magna Carta to Egyptian "religious tolerance" resulting in the flight of the bulk of non-Muslim groups in that nation. Ignoring the 4th Amendment when a President was losing face, ignoring the 1st because a government official's politics so heavily influenced her job she might as well have been on the Democratic National Committee, seeking to so heavily encumber the 2nd that everyone ignores that existing Federal Gun Law is based on Congress's right to raise REVENUE, and that a revenue program that costs more to administer than it takes in via SOT's each year MIGHT be more than a bit questionable, blowing off the requirement of States to follow Federal as well as State Constitutional guidelines (10th amendment) requiring stop and ask documentation (5th) . . . I could go on but there's no point. And THAT'S what created the Tea Party, not any ONE political party, but people who are tired of living with a set of laws that directly conflict with the founding documents of this nation, and the need to make a decision about what parts, if any, of that document needs must be revised or amended.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1370442866623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 10:34:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370443491210-10</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on democracy</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1370442553672</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 10:29:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'd say that would be true of any racial group. A 90% turnout one way when the rest of the nation is roughly split means they weren't voting based on policy, personal, or political reasons, but purely racial ones. And these are the folks calling white folks "racist". I think a bit of self examination is in order. And calling it "9 to 1" in favor of democrats would be heavily inaccurate. It was MUCH higher than that. More like 98% in this last election in favor of Barak Obama. I remember a schtick a group did on "Why did you vote for Barak Obama" and then gave respondents (Black) multiple potential reasons, all of them McCain policies that Obama denounced and, you guessed it, a significant majority of participants couldn't tell the difference. The voted for Obama because of his stance against abortion, for a larger military, for keeping Gitmo open, against a federal healthcare system (that's the one that confused the few that clued it), etc etc etc. Or at least that's what they said. So let's modify the good Representative's statement and say "The Republican party doesn't want ANYONE going to the polls who doesn't understand WHY they're pulling the lever, and given it due consideration, pulling it for the good of the nation, not because they'll get anything out of it". That's what conservatism is all about, not religion or guns or any of those other things, it's about being Conservative with the future of the nation but not taking outrageous chances with its future despite obvious trends that would be "politically incorrect" to point out, and therefore are almost always currently ignored.

Trent Franks' (R-Ariz.) proposed D.C. abortion bill to apply to the whole country and advanced the bill favorably to the full committee. The bill would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy in the United States in all cases except those in which the mother's life is in danger. All four Democrats on the panel voted against advancing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, arguing that it is unconstitutional and allows no exceptions for rape victims, incest victims, women whose health is endangered by a pregnancy, and cases of severe fetal anomalies. The 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade protects women's ability to have an abortion up until the fetus is viable outside the womb, which is usually believed to occur around the 24th week of pregnancy.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1370444234063</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 10:57:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370444357466-16</Id><Topic><Title>end tax tyranny! put taxes on an honor system, just send what you think you should</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1370437052304</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 08:57:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually the entirety of our Defense Department could be our Navy as it was supposed to be, keeping sea lanes open, with one arms of our strategic defense as no tactical threat to the US is, as you said, significant with this heavily an armed population, keep our Minuteman missiles, keep enough of the Air Force for interceptors and strategic bombers (at most we'd need two dozen bombers, maybe 180 F-22's to defend the US).

I trade because it supports the economy and because it helps keep my mind sharp . . . . so in a way I contribute to the economy, but i could do a great deal more if there was a government program that organized the severely disabled into remote work groups and taught all that could learn software engineering, how to be digital artists, etc, well, let's just say that's one development studio that I'd LOVE to run. I wonder how many people that would get off the SSDI and SSI roles and into doing seriously profitable and productive work, at least part time, some of them for the first time in their lives because their potential was ignored because who would believe someone who required 24hour care could actually be worthwhile. As for those who couldn't learn those skills, I could cull the rest for good personal care attendants, electricians, etc, relocate those to where needed (server farms, in home care positions etc). Yeah, I could probably put at least 40% of the unemployables to effective use given enough money to organize and start up, but the government can't because they'd have to write 1,000 page plus guidelines for writing the rules governing the regulations to be passed to . . . and by the time we were done we'd be right back where we started.

Currently we do NOT deploy tactical nuclear weapons on attack submarines, at least officially, so those would remain under the command of the Navy itself, with one Navy Strategic Command detachment with each Carrier group authorized to direct nuclear attacks. That'd make the Combined Nuclear Forces Group a separate and elite command composed almost entirely of officers, and the enlisted folk would be ships crew, Marines, and support and maintenance. Allow the militias up to date weaponry thats still affordable (old style anti tank guns, etc) as their "issue" weapons, and if the #$%$ truly hits the fan, we pass out more advanced weapons when they are excess to the needs of the Marine Corp. By that time we might well be able to fabricate modern weapons fast enough to arm the entire United States with them in a month. There would, aside from a group for standardizing militia training and organizing more formal training, mostly Militia officers with a VERY few Regular Army officers (who'd number in the hundreds instead of hundreds of thousands) watching to maintain interoperability requirements if the nation is again directly threatened. I could keep the seaways open with what we have now, even less I think, if we didn't give a fig about the security of our allies and if we were willing to use nuclear weapons and think of them as limited strategic or tactical weapons (hitting ToraBora with one wouldn't have been a bad idea, but we don't have an earth penetrating warhead yet) and employ them when they are the most appropriate choice. For instance Assad's chemical weapons stockpile is well clear of civilians and just the right size for a W80-1 via SLAM.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1370454039486</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 13:40:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370456608583-29</Id><Title>Susan LIAR (Rice) Benghazi Propagandist</Title><Msg>Facism is Evil!</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1370456608583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 14:23:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370457359956-30</Id><Topic><Title>Susan LIAR (Rice) Benghazi Propagandist</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1370456608583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-05 14:23:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obimbo is circling the wagons!
