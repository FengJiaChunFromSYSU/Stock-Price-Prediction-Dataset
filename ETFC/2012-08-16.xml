Bristol Palin said Saturday that she is "praying for" Paul Ryan and his family following Mitt Romney's decision to tap the congressman as his running mate. Hours after Romney introduced the Wisconsin congressman as his vice presidential pick, Palin urged her readers to "pause" before passing judgment on Romney's choice. "Don't write a word, don't make a snap judgment, don't critique the VP choice, don't exult in its brilliance," Palin wrote in a blog entry. "Just take a moment and realize that whomever is chosen, he is a person about to go through an ordeal that few people will ever experience."

Mitt Romney's lying on Medicare is beginning to make him sound, dare I say, pathologically unhinged. Never mind the fact checks and the other fact checks. Romney's got his fiction and is sticking to it: "Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare." We all know that Paul Ryan, in the budget Romney endorsed (last time I checked, anyway), included those exact same cuts to Medicare. And none of those cuts actually hit beneficiaries. They rein in the huge amount of taxpayer money going to overpayments in the Republican-created (and not paid for) Medicare Advantage program. So, you could almost commend Ryan for seeing where it makes sense to cut Medicare. Almost. But of course, Ryan just couldn't leave it at that, because that isn't going to destroy Medicare, the GOP's ultimate aim. What's going to destroy Medicare is his voucher plan. That would hurt seniors, forcing them to pay more and more out of pocket as the value of the vouchers decreases. That's what would happen in the future with Ryan's and Romney's Medicare plan. But what they really don't want to talk about is the cuts to seniors right now Ryan proposes by slashing Medicaid, which would happen immediately. The $800 billion in cuts over the next decade that Ryan proposes would have to end up hurting the six million seniors who rely on the program for nursing home and long-term care—two-thirds of all nursing home patients in the U.S. are covered by Medicaid. Cynically, Ryan made these dramatic cuts to Medicaid so that he could spare current Medicare retirees from seeing cuts, and could put off their pain—and their opposition—for at least a while. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) nailed Ryan on this ploy: "They care about the votes of seniors who are not poor and they don’t care about the votes and the consequences to seniors who are poor." Expect this to be one of those things that's off-limits to talk about. Mitt's running for president, for Pete's sake. That means you can't talk about what he stands for or what he'd do as president. You can't talk about him, or Ryan, at all.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345091454000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:30:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>31</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345091616000-7</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on the old</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345091454000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:30:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i don't get it - i'm old</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1345091616000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:33:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345091684000-8</Id><Topic><Title>Ann Tells Mittens to Continue Hiding !</Title><Username>drill_baby_drillllllll</Username><Timestamp>1345091331000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:28:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks. Wrong paste. In an interview with NBC set to air Thursday, Ann Romney, wife of Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said her husband's campaign will not release any additional tax returns to the public ahead of the election. "We have been very transparent to what's legally required of us," Romney told reporter Natalie Morales, according to excerpts from NBC News. "There's going to be no more tax releases given."

The Affordable Care Act actually enhances Medicare benefits by closing the prescription drug coverage gap known as the “doughnut hole” and expanding free preventive services, including an annual wellness visit. The Romney ad misleadingly implies that seniors will take a hit. “You paid in to Medicare for years. Every paycheck,” a narrator says. “Now, when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare.” The ad also ignores the bipartisan nature of the cuts: Congressional Republicans voted overwhelmingly in 2011 and 2012 to sustain them in the budget written by Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), now Romney’s running mate. In 2008, John McCain proposed similar cuts during his presidential campaign, a move Obama ironically criticized at the time. The Obama campaign immediately fired back, calling the ad “dishonest and hypocritical.” The Romney ad is an effort to deflect criticism of Ryan’s Medicare plan, which would replace the coverage guarantee with a voucher for seniors to buy their own private or government insurance plan. Republican strategists privately worry the plan will be a major liability. Obama’s cuts add eight years on the life of Medicare, according to the Congressional Budget Office, largely by reducing reimbursement rates to hospitals, prescription drugs under Medicaid and private insurance plans in Medicare Advantage. The AARP, as well as hospital and drug industries, endorsed the Affordable Care Act despite the cuts. The cuts to Medicare Advantage plans have resulted in higher enrollment and lower average premiums in 2011 and 2012, according to official figures. Reforms closing the “doughnut hole,” which were partly funded by the cuts, have also saved seniors money on prescription drugs. In addition, the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion offers seniors greater access to long-term care and other services that Medicare does not provide. The Department of Health and Human Services projects that beneficiaries of traditional Medicare will save roughly $4,200 over 10 years as a result of the Affordable Care Act. HHS expects that the law will also save seniors between $3,000 and $16,000 on average on prescription drugs, depending on their costs. “The savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised he’d sign Paul Ryan’s budget,” said Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith in a statement. “Because the president is eliminating subsidies to insurance companies and cutting waste and fraud, we’ve extended the life of Medicare by eight years. The truth is that the Romney-Ryan budget would end Medicare as we know it: People with Medicare would be left with nothing but a voucher in place of the guaranteed benefits they rely on today.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345128357000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:45:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345128525000-40</Id><Topic><Title>ACA expands benefits for seniors</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345128357000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>holy sh-t, you can put people in a coma with your posts. i mean really, how does anybody read what you post? i get through line 1 and my eyes glaze over. i try and try again to read it - but it just can't be done.</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1345128525000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:48:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345128597000-41</Id><Topic><Title>$3.00 dollar value, old platform,same old hype</Title><Username>nurse26yrs</Username><Timestamp>1345122205000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:03:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>3 to 6% percenters, if you think for a moment dark pool liquidity doesn't talk to the other hand in a handshake deal well there is always the moon lot sale for your future retirement years....don't forget to invest in the space helmets, get the one with eye in the sky cam so you can look back on earth from your dream land retirement center and remember etrade was once over $300.oo and i said then it was a $3.00 stock , when the bank was just coming up.......now forget about it the inside buys are attempts to save their jobs</Msg><Username>nurse26yrs</Username><Timestamp>1345128597000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:49:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345128711000-42</Id><Topic><Title>Biden to Exit VP Spot</Title><Username>princesslabium</Username><Timestamp>1345125070000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 09:51:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>princess......I have to agree with you on that one - OBIMBO can NO LONGER afford this bumbling IDIOT Biden and Hillary could actually run circles around OBIMBO!!!

Instead of signing up for our most efficient and popular health care program when you turn 65, you will instead be handed a voucher or coupon or whatever you want to call it, valued at $6000 a year in today's dollars to pay for private insurance on the open market. It's bad enough that $6000 won't pay for much of a policy and it's bad enough that most seniors have pre-existing conditions as defined by insurance companies, and it's bad enough that if Ryan and Romney are elected, they will do their best to eliminate the protection that people with those pre-existing conditions would have under the Affordable Care Act, but there is an aspect of his plan that is even worse. I am presently taking care of my mother (88) and my mother-in-law (89) and if I weren't there to do their finances, answer their mail, weed through the difficult legal language of a basic credit card argeement and explain it to them, they would, frankly, be lost. Not just in understanding basic information, but they would be sitting ducks to people who want to confuse them and take their money. I bet many of you know exactly what I'm talking about. The REAL disaster of the Ryan plan isn't so much of a financial disaster as it is a human disaster. His plan forces millions of people at age 65, 70, 75, 80 and older, most who have never purchased health insurance in their lives, to fend for themselves and go shopping for it on the open market. AND they have to stay on top of their complicated plan to make sure it stays up with their needs....all while they grow older and even simple details become more difficult to retain. For instance, my father, during the two years before he passed away, couldn't remember what insurance was, let alone shop for it. Paul Ryan's plan is a financial disaster for seniors, but it doesn't come close to the human toll it will have on those who need simplicity and protected coverage the most. Ryan and Romney and the entire GOP should be ashamed, but that would imply that they are capable of shame.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1345129037000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:57:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345129167000-48</Id><Title>18 Months of Work......</Title><Msg>and Freiberg gets to take home almost 20 million.

Aug 15, 2012 New Romney Plan: Make Medicare Insolvent by 2016 Yesterday, we discussed the Romney campaign’s attempt to distract from the Romney-Ryan plan to end Medicare as we know it and replace it with a voucher system that will increase seniors’ health care costs by thousands of dollars. The Romney campaign was also under fire for attacking the $716 billion in Medicare savings found in Obamacare, despite the fact that Romney himself had repeatedly endorsed plans including those exact same savings and even promised just this week that he’d sign the Ryan plan that included them into law. As we noted, Obamacare uses that money to expand benefits and strengthen Medicare by extending its solvency for an additional 8 years, while the Romney-Ryan plan would simply steal the $716 billion and use it to pay for new tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and huge corporations. Now Mitt Romney is arguing that he’ll put all of those savings back in to Medicare. ThinkProgress’ Igor Volsky explains how that will actually make the system less efficient and hasten Medicare’s demise: “My commitment is, if I become President, I’m going to restore that $716 billion to the Medicare trust fund so that current seniors can know that the trust fund is not being raided and get Medicare on track to be solvent long-term on a permanent basis,” Romney told CBS on Wednesday morning. But in replenishing the funds, Romney would actually be making the program worse off, not better. The Obamacare savings slow the growth of Medicare over the next decade by, in part: eliminating overpayments to private insurers in Medicare Advantage, reforming provider payments to encourage greater efficiency, tying reimbursements to improvements in economic productivity, and reducing fraud and abuse. The law does not impact patient benefits. CMS offers a partial breakdown: As a result of these savings, “growth in spending will be restrained” and the life of the Medicare trust fund is expanded by eight years, the government estimates. Sixteen million seniors are also benefiting from the savings by receiving preventive benefits without deductibles or co-pays and saving more than $3.9 billion on prescription drugs. Should Romney restore the $716 billion — and unless he institutes other yet to be specified reforms — we would move back to the old system of overpaying private insurers and providers. He’d be re-inserting inefficiency back into the system, jeopardizing the benefits that seniors are currently enjoying, and shrinking the solvency of the Medicare trust fund from 2024 under current law to 2016. And you don’t have to just take our word for it. An independent Medicare expert told us that Romney’s do-over plan will “definitely” make Medicare insolvent in just four short years: “All of the demonstration and pilot programs aimed at payment and delivery system reform would also be eliminated,” Steve Zuckerman of the Urban Institute told ThinkProgress. “Definitely, the 8 year extension in the life of the Medicare HI trust fund would be gone.” He added, “If I could ask Romney-Ryan one question on this topic it would be: After you repeal the ACA and restore the cuts in Medicare payments, would you then reinstate the Medicare cuts as part of your own budget plan?” BOTTOM LINE: In an attempt to get out from under one problem, Mitt Romney has only succeeded in making things worse by admitting that he’ll let the Medicare trust fund run dry in just four years. Any way you slice it, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan plan to end Medicare as we know it and leave seniors with steeply increased health care costs.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345140309000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:05:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>17</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345140936000-96</Id><Topic><Title>18 Months of Work......</Title><Username>billwilliselkins</Username><Timestamp>1345129167000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:59:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Way to go Governor - NO DRIVER LICENSES - NO SOCIAL SERVICES for the illegals!

The study, by the Institute for Policy Studies, said the companies, including AT&amp;T, Boeing and Citigroup, paid their CEOs an average of $20.4 million last year while paying little or no federal tax on ample profits, according to regulatory filings. On average, the 26 companies generated net income of more than $1 billion in the U.S., the study said. The study blasted tax rules allowing unlimited deductions for CEO "performance-based" pay, like many stock options. It said the five biggest performance payers among the 26 companies took $232 million of these deductions last year.</Msg><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345143221000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:53:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345143335000-104</Id><Title>shorting it till low 7's</Title><Msg>looking for huge short position to take it to new lows!!!should have never hired the dud!!!IMHO</Msg><Username>roadtoad25</Username><Timestamp>1345143335000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:55:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345143367000-105</Id><Topic><Title>18 Months of Work......</Title><Username>billwilliselkins</Username><Timestamp>1345129167000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 10:59:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Hey dung for brains".....nice opener!

Paul Ryan amended two years of his financial disclosure statements to add an income-producing trust worth between $1 million and $5 million that he had previously neglected to report. -snip- The trust was created in 2010 following the death of Janna Ryan's mother, Prudence Little, a prominent Oklahoma attorney. Janna Ryan's remaining interest in the trust is estimated between $1,000,001 and $5 million, according to the amended filings. Ryan's amended reports were hand delivered to the House Clerk with letters characterizing the belated disclosures as an "inadvertent omission." -snip- Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, said "the amount and timing of this new disclosure suggests that Ryan had not sought to be fully transparent about his income and investments until he felt compelled to do so."</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1345146178000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 15:42:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>13</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345146286000-116</Id><Title>This trading system is the best I have EVER used!</Title><Msg>Build wealth at home on your computer!

It doesn't affect actual coverage. It merely trims waste out of the system so, you know, it can remain solvent like you want. You think going from an extremely efficient public program, which runs at 2% administration costs, to a private system where they run 20% plus administration costs is really going to keep the system solvent. Meanwhile, they're removing all those who pay for your medicare into a private system. Who will support your medicare once they do that? It will only be a matter of time before they say the system is going broke and ask for more cuts from you. Lastly, AARP has a number of solutions, along with different democrats senators, to keep medicare solvent for a long time without turning it into yet another public *** mega-corporations can suck off of while screwing the tax payers over.

Replying to the comment that is so silly it had to be posted twice by a paid shill for the RNC. Pres. Obama did not cut Medicare by $750 billion. That is a rightwingnutjob lie. Long ago and far away, W Bu$h decided to give the big insurance corporations a handout by allowing them to administer Medicare accounts at about $1,100 per month for each eligible senior who signed up--PLUS a 15 percent freebie override for their bother. All the observers viewed this as a massive boondoggle, so Pres. Obama, the House, and the Senate took away the $500 billion handout. Medicare advantage still exists, nothing is gone except the corporate welfare checks. W Bu$h also decided to give Big Pharma a handout with the donut hole program that forced seniors to pay full price, a $250 billion boondoggle, for their Rx after the first $4,500 outlay. Astute observers noticed that this was a rip-off, so Pres. Obama, the House, and the Senate changed the utterly bogus donut hole giveaway and cut off the welfare checks to the drug makers. This is saving millions of seniors thousands of dollars on their Rx costs. For reasons that defy intelligent comprehension, Romney, Ryan, and rightwingnutjobs describe the elimination of $750 billion in corporate welfare to insurance and pharmaceutical companies as "reduction" in Medicare. It's GOP drivel because they're upset about some big corporations losing their freebies. And all of us who had/have Medicare advantage are still on the rolls and the process is so profitable that United Healthcare is offering me a ten dollar bill to get a physical exam, $10 for a colonoscopy, $10 for a cholesterol checkup, and $10 for a prostate exam. Of course, that dirty ratfink Obama did force them to take away my "free" gym membership.</Msg><Username>oldtimer60</Username><Timestamp>1345148130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 16:15:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>19</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345148136000-126</Id><Topic><Title>Huge Accumulation with Gap of 1 cent!!!</Title><Username>stmoon2000</Username><Timestamp>1345141822000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 14:30:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only the time will tell....

Here is how it went: Bain, along with other investors bought the Kansas City steel company (renamed GS Technologies) in 1993 for $75 million - $8 million was put up by Bain. One year later, 1994, the Bain appointed management of the steel companey issued $125 MILLION in bonds "Bain got its money back quickly. The new company issued $125 million in bonds and paid Bain a $36.1 million dividend in 1994." NOte that $36 million went back to Bain - AFTER ONE YEARS OWNERSHIP (8/75 = 10.7% ownership for Bain). That's a return of 451% on their $8 million investment -IN ONE YEAR!. NOte that that $36 million was therefore not available for investing in new, more efficient machinery andor buildings - is something you might want to do if your objective was to build the company into something better than it was when you bought it. There is much more to the story like the fact that in 1997 the union called for a strike because they didn't feel the company was putting enough aside to protect workers pensions and retirees health benefits. (uh-huh). It should also be noted that despite these developments, a competitor steel company made an offer in 1997 to buy GS Tech for "a whole lot of money" according to the CEO of the company at the time, Roger Regelbrugge, but Bain turned them down (please note, 1997 was BEFORE the departure of Romney and the purported ending of any influence with Bain management). Apparently Bain thought they could get more money out of the company their way compared to what the competitor was willing to pay, which sounded like a very good offer, according to Regelbrugge. Later on in 2001 the company declared bankruptcy. but firms go bankrupt every day and the workers retirement benefits are protected. BUT BAIN HAS CREATED SO MUCH DEBT AND COMBINED WITH BAD MANAGEMENT CAUSE THE COMPANY TO BE IN SUCH DECIMATED STATE THAT IT RENEGED ON THE PENSION AND HEALTH BENEFIT GUARANTEES ("What's more, a federal government insurance agency had to pony up $44 million to bail out the company's underfunded pension plan. Nevertheless, Bain profited on the deal, receiving $12 million on its $8 million initial investment and at least $4.5 million in consulting fees." {link}__presumably the $12 profit was in addition to the $35 million it skimmed from the bond issue in 1994_Bill USA). so whether Romney 'left' Bain in 1999 or whatever, the bad judgements that lead to the downfall of this company were made much earlier while Romney was defiinitely there. As to Romney's 'departure', he was the sole major stockholder in BAin, the president and CEO. Does anybody believe anybody put in to manage Bain when Rmoney went to Olympics would manage BAin and its investments in any way that was NOT CONSISTENT with Romney's wishes.

We continue to think that E*TRADE will eventually be sold, but a potential buyer will need to feel comfortable taking on E*TRADE s loan book ($11.8bn as of 2Q12). While the loan book has characteristics that raise eyebrows (110% LTV on the 1-4 family loans, 114% CLTV on the home equity loans, mostly 2005-2007 vintages, over 80% originated by a third party), we want to highlight some of the positive trends that E*TRADE s book is experiencing. Some signs of improvement in housing prices. E*TRADE s loans are most heavily concentrated in California (47% of 1-4 family loans and 32% of home equity loans), followed by New York (7% of both the 1-4 family and home equity books) and Florida (also 7% of both the 1-4 family and home equity books)."

Medicare insurance companies are too cowardly to challenge the health insurance industry as it rips the taxpayers for hundreds of millions of duplicate tests and unnecessary procedures and operations and medications annually. The insurance companies are even in on some of these instances of fraud. Obama wants to clean some of this criminality up, but Republicans want people to make maximum profits by any means necessary. And if the Dems are ever able to cut off the free government money that insurance companies get, they, not the insurance companies will be blamed for the increased premiums and co-pays that seniors will pay. Supplemental insurance companies don't want to compete by challenging the criminals in the health industry. They just want that free taxpayer money that fattens their profits. Need we more proof that business cannot survive without the government in America? And any Republican who says otherwise is a sociopathic liar, a liar who is, of course, getting loads of free money in some way from the government for his business or businesses himself. Most politicians are hypocrites, but Republicans are the going-away winners in that category.</Msg><Username>rampant_rose</Username><Timestamp>1345170022000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 22:20:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345170658000-152</Id><Topic><Title>GOP assault on the old</Title><Username>foknewsjunkie</Username><Timestamp>1345091454000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 00:30:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>union........we might need the military in the next few month!

This Republican plan would desert millions of children, people with disabilities and chronic diseases, and seniors who need help paying for long-term care. It would decimate the working poor and leave hospitals in the poorest neighborhoods without enough money to provide lifesaving care. The Republicans, led by extremist Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, are also playing a cynical shell game because a federal cut in Medicaid dollars to the states simply passes the buck and gives the states less money -- and that cost-shift will force states to make draconian cuts that hurt the neediest people. And it won't help states meet unanticipated needs, such as an increased demand for services in a recession.</Msg><Username>union_dude25</Username><Timestamp>1345174763000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 23:39:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
