The BEST option is to sell the company an reward the shareholders with whatever comes of it, because based on the current status, economics, growth potential, etc... a better return will come from a sale. One thing GOOD that happened in the year following the summer of rejection (June 2011) was that ETFC liquidated over $2 billion in loans, wrote off $700 million more bad loans, and is one year closer to refinance. At this stage, should management elect to somehow think they are superheros and risk shareholder funds on some 'hope and change' business plan, MANAGEMENT should be sued or pursued by activist investors. Griffin by now has had enough, and hopefully the only reason for his silence is his knowledge that there is a transaction in process. I would expect such a transaction before year end - also to include a call of the 12 1/2% springing lien notes just prior to sale and before a 10Q report. Effectively the cost of calling the notes will be absorbed in the selling price and not reflected on the income statements of the buyer or seller. That is, the sale will be completed prior to what would be the final 10k/Q.</Msg><Username>brandish_mow</Username><Timestamp>1343405661000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:14:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343406814000-39</Id><Title>disconcerting isn't a gaffe</Title><Msg>Giving the Queeen an Ipod full of rap music and bad speeches is a gaffe.

Even notwithstanding the margin interest, I still do better by taking position with leverage then de-leverging them should they go static so I don't sit on too much dead money. Afterall, if the funds are not only slowly appreciating, if so slowly that margin time value would be destroyed but not replaced by appreciation, then at least I get the margin value of the stock to place elsewhere that I may be able to make shorter term gains. The tax structure in the future, at least, will most likely heavily favor long term capital gains while inflicting punishing short term gains and income taxes on high earning individuals. As I'm no where near what they'd call the 1% YET, I'd like to be someday, and so I am gearing myself as much or more toward long term positions as intermediate (intrayear) and short term (intraquarter) gains. I don't do the daytrading thing. If I'm in and out of a position in a day its because the position has started to crash and I either stopped out or exited in hope of re-entering with a better price later. Weird observation : Sometimes I do it the other way, where I'll sell a previously purchase lot then buy the same shares back near the close at a discount, but not typically the other way around, which as long as a "buy/sell" transaction they get irritated, a "sell/buy" transaction on the long side doesn't seem to elicit a response.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1343408405000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 13:00:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343409085000-47</Id><Topic><Title>Laura Bush: I think George makes an easy target</Title><Username>shineola_98</Username><Timestamp>1343345190000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 19:26:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Someone claims she was dumped!

I held my stocks since the opening, right now they're up more than you made daytrading yours on a percentage basis. That said I also don't intend to sell, figure them to go up further in the future. Now, I always could be wrong, but I usually won't put money into a stock unless there's either an exit strategy or a goal, and I don't consider a one day gainer to be much of a goal anymore. I used to mind you, some years ago, but I ended up losing money I could have made on my investments over the last 10 years because I simply had a tendency to go for those easy profits and sell too soon. At one point I held 1800 shares of Apple at $16 pre-split, which would be 3,600 shares today at around 576.00 a share . . . Think I don't regret selling those for a lousy buck and a half a share back in 2005? Not to mention a number of other, otherwise successful Apple trades that also netted me decent sums, but not nearly as much as if I'd been a buy and hold investor. No, the people I saw make the most money on that board took an early core position, which they periodically added to but never took from, and which gains would go long term, while trading the fluctuations with a similar by constantly traded churn which generated the profits (theoretically) to add to the long term position. My ETFC permanent position is now 2000 shares of which 1500 are already long term. Around that I'm trading, right now, about 2000 more with 1000 aimed at the short term and another 1000 in the intermediate. I think that'll serve me better than trading in and out, and least in the long run. When I want to gamble I go to Vegas, and even then I play blackjack, though I can't do the count in my head anymore.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1343409140000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 13:12:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343410342000-49</Id><Topic><Title>disconcerting isn't a gaffe</Title><Username>hydronicoctopussy</Username><Timestamp>1343406814000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 12:33:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Listen to his words carefully..

That is, every Republican except for Florida’s former Republican Party chairman Jim Greer, who, scorned by his party and in deep legal trouble, blew the lid off his what he claims was a systemic effort to suppress the black vote. In a 630-page deposition recorded over two days in late May, Greer, who is on trial for corruption charges, unloaded a litany of charges against the “whack-a-do, right-wing crazies” in his party, including the effort to suppress the black vote. In the deposition, released to the press yesterday, Greer mentioned a December 2009 meeting with party officials. “I was upset because the political consultants and staff were talking about voter suppression and keeping blacks from voting,” he said, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

The Soviet Union had a large naval base in Communist ally Vietnam but post-Soviet Russia opted to vacate the Cam Ranh base in 2002, during President Vladimir Putin's first Kremlin term, because rent payments were a burden on state coffers. The fate of Russia's only naval facility outside the former Soviet Union, a maintenance and supply facility in the Syrian port of Tartous, is uncertain because of the conflict in Syria. Chirkov said Russia was "working out the issue of creating sites for material and technical support on the territory of Cuba, the Seychelles and Vietnam," RIA reported. Chirkov's wording suggested facilities in those countries might be less extensive than full-scale naval bases. Navy officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Vietnamese President Truong Tan Sang, who was in Russia and was to meet Putin on Friday, was quoted as telling a Russian radio station that Vietnam has "no intention of cooperating with any country with the aim of military use of the port of Cam Ranh".</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343420631000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 16:23:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343420804000-72</Id><Topic><Title>GOP admits racist voter suppression</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343414757000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like a a pretty good community organizer effort to me.

Student Voting Laws By State Click here to view a large version of this image. ALEC describes itself as a “nonpartisan membership association for conservative state lawmakers who shared a common belief in limited government, free markets, federalism, and individual liberty.” In Wisconsin, where public attention now is focused on Gov. Scott Walker’s (R) efforts to undermine the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining, there is another piece of proposed legislation that could have a substantial negative impact on the state’s young and minority voters. Conservative representatives in the state have proposed a law, backed by Walker, that would ban students from using in-state university- or college-issued IDs for proof-of-residency when voting. If this legislation became law, it would become one of the strictest voter registration laws in the country and would provide significant logistical and financial barriers for a variety of groups, including student and minority voters.** Meanwhile, as Campus Progress reported last month, in New Hampshire, state House Speaker William O’Brien (R- Hillsborough 4) says that proposed election legislation will “tighten up the definition of a New Hampshire resident.” O’Brien claims that college towns experience hundreds of same-day voter registrations and that those are the ballots of people who “are kids voting liberal, voting their feelings, with no life experience.”</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343428522000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 18:35:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343428627000-77</Id><Topic><Title>GOP admits racist voter suppression</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343414757000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unfortunately, the examples in Wisconsin and New Hampshire are not isolated incidents. They are part of a disturbing trend of states with new conservative majorities that are attempting to pass laws that would disenfranchise student and minority voters. Some of the legislation is strikingly similar to model legislation drafted by ALEC [PDF]. Rather than seeking to persuade young voters on the issues, these conservatives are aiming to restrict access to voting through draconian measures. Their efforts are raising the ire of College Democrats and College Republicans alike. The president of the College Republicans at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, Richard Sunderland, tells Campus Progress that the GOP should focus on bringing “younger students into the fold as Republicans, as opposed to this, which seems like more of an attack.” Sunderland adds that while he is a Republican, “The way I see the lines here, is we are students and first and foremost. As students, this is attacking our right to vote.” According to research by the Fair Elections Legal Network (FELN) and Campus Progress, in the past six years, seven states have enacted laws that disenfranchise students or make it more difficult for them to vote. This year, 18 additional states are considering similar laws, while other states are proposing voter ID laws that would depress turnout among other groups of voters—particularly those who traditionally lean left. These requirements run the gamut from requiring in-state driver’s licenses, to banning school IDs, to prohibiting first-time voters—essentially every college-aged voter—from voting by absentee ballot. All together, these barriers create new logistical and financial barriers for many people attempting to vote.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343428627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 18:37:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343428742000-78</Id><Topic><Title>GOP admits racist voter suppression</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343414757000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) spurred restrictive voter ID laws Many of the state proposals appear to stem from model legislation known as the Voter ID Act (also known as Photo ID) that was developed by the American Legislative Exchange Council. In a 2009 public report [PDF], ALEC described Voter ID legislation as “proactive” and offered up examples of states successfully passing the legislation as providing “a helpful guide” for other states to follow. Deemed the “political player you’ve never heard of” by Fortune magazine earlier this year, ALEC was launched in 1973 by Heritage Foundation founder Paul Weyrich and is funded by conservative organizations including the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, and the John M. Olin Foundation. ALEC’s “Private Enterprise Board,” includes representatives from companies including Peabody Energy, Coca-Cola, AT&amp;T, Johnson &amp; Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, and Wal-Mart, as well as Koch Industries. ALEC charges corporations a fee and gives them access to members of state legislatures. Under ALEC’s auspices, legislators, corporate representatives, and ALEC officials work together to draft model legislation, generally on business-related issues. As ALEC spokesperson Michael Bowman told NPR, this system is especially effective because “you have legislators who will ask questions much more freely at our meetings because they are not under the eyes of the press, the eyes of the voters.” Tea Party organizations, like the Wisconsin Patriot Coalition, also look to ALEC for guidance. The group lists the Voter ID Act in its legislative agenda [PDF] and directly links back to ALEC as its source. Charles Monaco, the press and new media specialist at the Progressive States Network, a state-based organization that has been tracking this issue, says, “ALEC is involved with a vast network of well-funded right wing organizations working to spread voter ID laws in the state legislatures. It is clear what their purpose is with these laws—to reduce progressive turnout and tilt the playing field towards their preferred candidates in elections.” Some of the ties between these networks are easily identifiable: Courtney O’Brien, the staff member at ALEC responsible for the group’s elections task force, previously worked at the Charles G. Koch Foundation.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343428742000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 18:39:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343428863000-79</Id><Topic><Title>GOP admits racist voter suppression</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343414757000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ALEC’s efforts seem to be working. Out of the eight states that have legislators currently listed as members of the ALEC Public Safety and Elections task force, five are either considering or already have laws that were graded harmful to student voting. New Hampshire and Wisconsin, the two states currently considering the most extreme version of the law, both have ALEC members represented on the committees. And in Wisconsin, that member is Rep. Scott Suder (R-District 69), the state’s Majority Leader, who ushered the legislation through the Wisconsin State Assembly. That legislation includes provisions similar to the ALEC model legislation, which Campus Progress obtained from a source outside of ALEC. This copy shows that the model law was approved by the ALEC board of directors on Aug. 27, 2009. (ALEC refused to distribute the model legislation to Campus Progress.ALEC spokesperson Raegan Weber* emailed, “Model legislation is a privilege of membership and therefore we don’t provide this publicly” -- a somewhat unusual practice by a non-profit public policy group organized under the Internal Revenue Service code as a 501(c)(3) charitable or educational group; most such organizations make public most fruits of their labors, rather than concealing it from people who aren’t members.) ALEC spokesperson Weber stated that the group is “neutral” as to whether student IDs should count as an acceptable form of ID. However, the ALEC model legislation obtained by Campus Progress shows that it would indeed prohibit student IDs. Additionally, of the four states cited as positive examples for Voter ID by ALEC in June 2009, three would not consider student IDs an acceptable proof of residency. One of those four states is Indiana, and One Wisconsin Now, a progressive Wisconsin political organization, noted that, “The bill's authors, Republican Rep. Jeff Stone and Sen. Joe Leibham, have modeled their bill after Indiana's Voter ID law.” Where is the alleged voter fraud?</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343428863000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 18:41:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343428906000-80</Id><Topic><Title>GOP admits racist voter suppression</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1343414757000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 14:45:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While the legislation promoted by ALEC and its allies is supposedly aimed at reducing voter fraud, there is little evidence that it would actually achieve that goal. In Wisconsin, for example, investigations by the attorney general, a Republican, found that in 2008, out of the three million votes, only 20 of them were fraudulent. And it’s not clear the proposed law could have prevented those 20 fraudulent votes. “There is no evidence of widespread or systemic voter fraud occurring in the U.S. in recent history,” says Robert Brandon, president of FELN. “These photo ID bills really are a solution in search of a problem. I don't understand why state legislatures would seek to spend millions of dollars implementing laws to fix a problem that doesn't exist. With most states facing such high budget deficits, this just seems irresponsible.” ALEC has helped its members skirt these truths by pointing out that the lack of problem isn’t necessarily a deterrent. In the case of Indiana’s successful passage of Voter ID, ALEC writes there “was no requirement that Indiana show prior evidence of impersonation fraud in Indiana to justify a voter ID law.” Voter disenfranchisement: a deliberate attempt to shape 2012 elections The real effect of these Voter ID laws is to deter and prevent entire categories of potential voters from casting ballots—students and other young people, and minority voters. It’s unclear how disenfranchising any voter relates directly to ALEC’s stated principles of “limited government, free markets, federalism, and individual liberty.” Efforts by corporate, conservative, and Tea Party interests to enact laws that would disenfranchise progressive-leaning constituencies—without evidence that vote fraud is a widespread issue—can only be viewed as a cynical, hardball tactic. The bills attack the right to vote, a right at the heart of democracy. Legislative efforts to stop young people and other minorities from voting are gaining ground across the country—and such efforts could dramatically alter the landscape of the 2012 elections.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1343428906000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 18:41:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>12</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343429270000-81</Id><Topic><Title>Caution Must Be Maintained</Title><Username>yorgosnxj230</Username><Timestamp>1343391221000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 08:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very good record</Msg><Username>kimmijtz145</Username><Timestamp>1343429270000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 18:47:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343430914000-82</Id><Topic><Title>Mittens Executes Complete Flip Flop</Title><Username>mitt_wit</Username><Timestamp>1343401759000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 11:09:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like it's gonna be another long lonely weekend for the Log Cabin One Star girls.</Msg><Username>lonelygaybillie</Username><Timestamp>1343430914000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 19:15:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>23</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343432289000-83</Id><Topic><Title>Nice day, but below average volume</Title><Username>hermes4trading</Username><Timestamp>1343426815000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 18:06:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who bought all those shares on the day after earnings.

Am I right, you either have to punish non blacks more or punish blacks less. Liberalism is truly a mental disorder. President Obama Backs Race-Based School Discipline Policies President Barack Obama is backing a controversial campaign by progressives to regulate schools’ disciplinary actions so that members of major racial and ethnic groups are penalized at equal rates, regardless of individuals’ behavior. His July 26 executive order established a government panel to promote “a positive school climate that does not rely on methods that result in disparate use of disciplinary tools.” “African Americans lack equal access to highly effective teachers and principals, safe schools, and challenging college-preparatory classes, and they disproportionately experience school discipline,” said the order, titled “White House Initiative On Educational Excellence.” Because of those causes, the report suggests, “over a third of African American students do not graduate from high school on time with a regular high school diploma, and only four percent of African American high school graduates interested in college are college-ready across a range of subjects.” “What this means is that whites and Asians will get suspended for things that blacks don’t get suspended for,” because school officials will try to level punishments despite groups’ different infraction rates, predicted Hans Bader, a counsel at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Bader is a former official in the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, and has sued and represented school districts and colleges in civil-rights cases. “It is too bad that the president has chosen to set up a new bureaucracy with a focus on one particular racial group, to the exclusion of all others,” said Roger Clegg, the president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. “A disproportionate share of crimes are committed by African Americans, and they are disproportionately likely to misbehave in school… [because] more than 7 out of 10 African Americans (72.5 percent) are born out of wedlock… versus fewer than 3 out of 10 whites,” he said in a statement to The Daily Caller. Although ” you won’t see it mentioned in the Executive Order… there is an obvious connection between these [marriage] numbers and how each group is doing educationally, economically, criminally,” he said.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1343434150000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-07-27 20:09:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>15</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343436550000-88</Id><Title>Why would Brak care? it aint his money</Title><Msg>He don't know what [isreal]. &lt;--That how his team spells it.
