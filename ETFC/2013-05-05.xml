It happened to me every time. Why? Because when you committed something like 10,000 shares around, you were freaking out on a daily basis, and wanted to close the big positions whenever the bounce brought you back above the entry point. Looking back 30 days, I realized that I should buy back 40 contracts for $11 call on Monday. ETFC could go above $11 any time. 05/03/13 Sold Short 1 ETFC May 18 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.16 15.48 05/03/13 Sold Short 39 ETFC May 18 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.16 595.74 05/03/13 Sold To Close 50 ETFC Jun 22 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.35 1,716.23 05/03/13 Sold 2,000 of ETFC @ $10.7724 (Order #1484) 21,536.32 05/03/13 Sold To Close 100 ETFC May 18 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.12 1,140.51 05/03/13 Sold 1,400 of ETFC @ $10.7612 (Order #1480) 15,065.34 05/03/13 Sold 600 of ETFC @ $10.76 (Order #1480) 6,447.86 05/01/13 Sold Short 20 ETFC May 18 '13 $10 Put(ETFC) @ $0.19 361.71 05/01/13 Sold Short 25 ETFC Jul 20 '13 $10 Put(ETFC) @ $0.53 1,304.11 04/26/13 Sold Short 25 ETFC May 18 '13 $10 Put(ETFC) @ $0.22 529.01 04/26/13 Sold Short 8 ETFC May 18 '13 $10 Put(ETFC) @ $0.19 147.87 04/26/13 Sold Short 1 ETFC May 18 '13 $10 Put(ETFC) @ $0.19 18.48 04/26/13 Sold Short 26 ETFC May 18 '13 $10 Put(ETFC) @ $0.19 472.49 04/25/13 Bought To Open 10 ETFC May 18 '13 $12 Call(ETFC) @ $0.04 -45.19 04/25/13 Bought To Open 16 ETFC May 18 '13 $12 Call(ETFC) @ $0.05 -88.24 04/25/13 Bought To Open 32 ETFC May 18 '13 $12 Call(ETFC) @ $0.03 -120.51 04/25/13 Bought To Open 21 ETFC May 18 '13 $12 Call(ETFC) @ $0.04 -94.81 04/25/13 Bought To Open 21 ETFC May 18 '13 $12 Call(ETFC) @ $0.03 -73.81 04/25/13 Sold 4,900 of ETFC @ $10.37 (Order #1473) 50,811.86 04/25/13 So</Msg><Username>etfc2013</Username><Timestamp>1367727070297</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 00:11:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367727171898-2</Id><Topic><Title>FORECAST: In 20 Years E-Trade Is The Worlds Largest Bank!</Title><Username>rogerdonna_1988</Username><Timestamp>1367521094828</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 14:58:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>04/25/13 Sold 100 of ETFC @ $10.375 (Order #1473) 1,029.48 04/25/13 Sold 1,393 of ETFC @ $10.30 (Order #1472) 14,347.57 04/25/13 Sold 200 of ETFC @ $10.315 (Order #1472) 2,054.96 04/25/13 Sold 3,407 of ETFC @ $10.31 (Order #1472) 35,125.38 04/23/13 Sold Short 20 ETFC Jan 17 '15 $10 Put(ETFC) @ $1.74 3,461.55 04/23/13 Sold Short 20 ETFC Jan 18 '14 $12 Put(ETFC) @ $2.40 4,781.52 04/23/13 Sold 3,000 of ETFC @ $9.932 (Order #1469) 29,787.34 04/22/13 Bought To Open 100 ETFC May 18 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.06 -659.91 04/22/13 Bought To Open 20 ETFC Jun 22 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.14 -290.32 04/22/13 Bought To Open 30 ETFC Jun 22 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.14 -443.43 04/22/13 Bought 3,000 of ETFC @ $10.00 -30,000.00 04/22/13 Bought 10,000 of ETFC @ $11.00 -110,019.99 04/22/13 Option Assignment 100 ETFC Apr 20 '13 $11 Put(ETFC) --- 04/22/13 Option Assignment 30 ETFC Apr 20 '13 $10 Put(ETFC) --- 04/18/13 Sold 4,300 of ETFC @ $9.611 (Order #1462) 41,326.37 04/18/13 Sold 400 of ETFC @ $9.615 (Order #1462) 3,837.92 04/18/13 Sold 300 of ETFC @ $9.6103 (Order #1462) 2,883.02 04/17/13 Bought 5,000 of ETFC @ $9.548 (Order #1461) -47,747.99 04/17/13 Sold 2,500 of ETFC @ $9.7624 (Order #1458) 24,397.46 04/16/13 Bought 2,500 of ETFC @ $9.70 (Order #1457) -24,257.99 04/15/13 Sold To Close 68 ETFC Apr 20 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.06 372.68 04/15/13 Sold To Close 32 ETFC Apr 20 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.07 199.53 04/15/13 Sold Short 30 ETFC Apr 20 '13 $10 Put(ETFC) @ $0.31 906.40 04/12/13 Sold Short 25 ETFC May 18 '13 $10 Put(ETFC) @ $0.42 1,029.11 04/08/13 Sold Short 20 ETFC Oct 19 '13 $11 Put(ETFC) @ $1.55 3,081.56 04/08/13 Bought To Open 50 ETFC May 18 '13 $12 Call(ETFC) @ $0.05 -283.95 04/08/13 Bought To Open 40 ETFC Apr 20 '13 $11 Call(ETFC) @ $0.05 -228.58 04/04/13 Bought 2,000 of ETFC @ $10.108 (Order #1445) -20,223.99</Msg><Username>etfc2013</Username><Timestamp>1367727171898</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 00:12:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367779244605-3</Id><Title>They knew it all along.

"I think everybody in the mission thought it was a terrorist attack from the beginning," Greg Hicks, a 22-year foreign service diplomat who was the highest-ranking U.S. official in Libya after the strike, told investigators under authority of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Hicks, the former U.S. Embassy Tripoli deputy chief of mission, was not in Benghazi at the time of the attack, which killed Chris Stevens - then the U.S. ambassador to Libya - and three other Americans.</Msg><Username>coward_of_benghazi</Username><Timestamp>1367779244605</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 14:40:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367797382241-4</Id><Topic><Title>Shame about Ty Woods, Glen Doherty, Sean Smith and Christopher Stevens</Title><Username>coward_of_benghazi</Username><Timestamp>1367703273655</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 17:34:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The REAL shame is for the 3000 Americans who died in 9/11 because Bush ignored all the warnings.</Msg><Username>methuserlaw</Username><Timestamp>1367797382241</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 19:43:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367802412034-5</Id><Topic><Title>FORECAST: In 20 Years E-Trade Is The Worlds Largest Bank!</Title><Username>rogerdonna_1988</Username><Timestamp>1367521094828</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 14:58:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You Obviously work for Bernanke....</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1367802412034</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 21:06:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
