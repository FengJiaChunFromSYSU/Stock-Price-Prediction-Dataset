It means he shot him cold blooded. "After explaining how DNA tests were done, Gorgone said none of Zimmerman’s DNA was found under Martin’s fingernails or on the hooded sweatshirt Martin wore. The prosecution maintains that the lack of DNA undermines Zimmerman’s claim of self-defense." The video of Zimmer entering police facilities showed a clean face. His "injuries" were produced after police released him.</Msg><Username>methuserlaw</Username><Timestamp>1372914101646</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 01:01:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>22</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372950649601-4</Id><Topic><Title>Independence Day.

Commander in Chief is not supposed to act until all information is on the table. No one knew at the time even where the attack was coming from nor its perpetrators. Obama was watching burning US Embassy in real time for several hours. Than he watched real time ambassador Stevens body mutilated and dragged on the streets. He ordered not to interfere. May be he liked the movie? Sorry... Bad sarcasm. Can't give other meaningful explanation. 9.11.2001 attack was meticulously prepared. There were warnings signs all over leading to attack but intelligence didn't connect the dots together, so there was nothing requiring specific action on behalf of Bush administration. 9.11.2001 attack happened only 8 months into Bush administration when we didn't learn nearly enough about terrorism as we did 11 years later. Obama sent Americans to known hot bed of terror. Unprotected. WILLFULLY ignored multiple requests for enforcement, ignored all OBVIOUS signs leading to attack. Brits reacted promptly. Obama decided that's nothing to worry about. W. sent troops to Afghanistan first shortly after 9/11 indirect response. Obama sent no one to investigate, nor for appropriate response. Instead he launched moronic, deceptive, blame the video campaign in front of whole world to distract public from his utter failure. There are multiple witnesses not available for questioning 9 months later. It's worse than deception, it's cover up. Obama lied to tens of millions of Americans that he called Benghazi a terrorist act on day one during 2nd presidential debate. We know he lies a lot to public. But this lie was utterly disgusting. Enough? Doubt I convinced you in anything. But you threw the challenge... Not much of a challenge.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1372962417309</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 14:26:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372964922569-9</Id><Title>Zimerman says the thug was beating hm up</Title><Msg>The prosecutors are going to have time portraying meek little Zim as the aggressor if he never touched Trayvon.</Msg><Username>dumb_as_an_ashtray</Username><Timestamp>1372964922569</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 15:08:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>13</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372965690702-10</Id><Topic><Title>Big Trouble for Zimmer</Title><Username>methuserlaw</Username><Timestamp>1372914101646</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 01:01:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You white patty wouldn't have a clue what happened even if you had been there.

At the moment it was pure chaos. Bush had NO CLUE what decicions might have been needed ASAP, no one did. His actions looked like a deer in headlights, not a leader. It is also clear the Benghazi was a CIA opaeration, so stop acting like it was purely a a diplomstis station. It is also clear that Obama was told that there was little the military could do to help in the time frame given. You can keep on pretending that somehow, Obama failed to make the simple, easy decision to send aid, but it fails KISS.</Msg><Username>sec_fordummies</Username><Timestamp>1372967273213</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 15:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>15</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372978292431-16</Id><Topic><Title>John Kerry Yachting during Eqypt Coup</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1372956336684</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 12:45:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Hanoi John hears a noise, hold onto your Mimosa.
