Hope he can do that one right, because it makes him the highest, by the tax payers paid painter in the world and the only one with armed protection! At least he stayed away from congress where he could have screwed up more things for the country, like his latest accomplishment, trying to change the gun laws! He would have been better off to attend a gun show and see things first hand and learn the difference between a pistol and a rifle - but that would be too much to ask! Ah what da heck, he has just blown millions with his Hawaiian vacation and let's just raise the next debt ceiling, so he can take more vacations and start traveling around the world to meet with leaders to make him feel important! Forgot, he still got a date with Putin to scrap our and NATO's defenses! PLANING to look important and getting sworn in on MLK day only shows the REAL KING versus the fake King OBIMBO which will be remembered as the WORST wannabe president in history, supported by the union mob, freeloader and idiots, mark my words!

(Gave you a thumbs up) Almost ALL fire arms are SEMI automatic, even my six shooter, where I don't have to "reload", just flip out the cylinder, or #$%$ the barrel on the other one, exchange pre loaded cylinders and fire away - takes just about the same time as exchanging magazines in my High Standard, which holds 10 rounds. So that argument doesn't stand! Even a bolt action rifle with a magazine is semi automatic, if you are trained in fast operating the bolt action, like I use sometimes hunting. What I am missing and didn't hear addressed is what he is going to do with the criminals, drug/gun dealers which are armed, the motor cycle gangs, etc.???????? Did OBIMBO ever hear of tubular magazines - what is he going to do about them - they require manual reloading after shooting? What about the hunting ammo, they are hollow point for max. impact/damage - combat ammo is solid and goes thru the body??? OBIMBO just created a whole new market for other criminals - gun running and robbery of licensed gun owners. (Just like the Chicago mob!) Why is it that so many guns on the street which get caught have erased Serial 3's????? Those are the things that need to be addressed! Aren't "cop killer bullets" outlawed, how come police officers still get shot with them on the street??? How about the "modified trigger filed" weapons on the street, which out shoot the police, what's done about that??? And when a criminal is caught - he is "BACK OUT ON THE STREET in no time - what is proposed about that???! Synopsis: "WINDOW DRESSING" - a clueless VP/President trying to pass/duplicate laws on the books already and create new ones which will only aid the deranged and criminals to inflict more harm on the defenseless and on the law abiding citizens!

Remember that last quarter WOULD have been profitable if one of their mortgage service providers had provided them with accurate data. They'll have problem is more "inaccurate data" comes to light, but otherwise should make a profit this quarter, if not a huge one, replacing the large year ago loss. Forward guidance will be more important to after earnings price movements than this quarters results either way it goes. It's still a buy for those without a significant position, but the days of strong buy fled with sub $9 prices. For me now it's just a hold.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358645099764</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 20:24:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358645238285-9</Id><Topic><Title>4 People Shot At 3 Different Gun Shows On Gun Appreciation Day</Title><Username>slayersmother</Username><Timestamp>1358636816720</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 18:06:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I heard about a guy who shot himself in the hand while reloading his CHL weapon after a show, but not someone shot AT a show.

You can't assign one set of rights to people in the city and another to people out in the sticks. Criminals will NOT give up their weapons, so why should I be stuck facing real AK's coming up from South America with a bolt action rifle? I'm like, what, 30 miles outside any real town with an average half kilometer between ranches and ONE constable for the whole area. The summary of my questions regarding intruders addressed to the Sheriff was essentially that since my land was posted (heavily) "If they're trespassing and screwing with your land, call 911, if they approach you or try to steal of break stuff, shoot them". Well no #$%$. What would YOU suggest I do? Be like so many rural farmers in Mexico and just cede my land to the narco's? Fortunately I don't give a fig WHAT they try to do with these new laws. I own an NFA licensed conversion device, which means unlike 99.99% of the population I'm allowed to own a REAL assault rifle, full auto selection and all, in any one of a LARGE number of configurations. HK G3, G33, HK53, and MP5SD are the current host receivers I have. I was collecting the HK51, MP5 and MP5K before this MADNESS happened, now the host receiver prices are so obscene that I feel no reason to buy another at these prices.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358655442081</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 23:17:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358655453140-12</Id><Topic><Title>Mr.President, stop the violence in the inter cities</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358550463045</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 18:07:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As for the next generation of gun owners, they're going to be shut out of most of the best of those weapons as their ownership, by dint of scarcity and commerce, moves them out of the hands of the remaining middle class owners and into the hands of the rich. And guess what, the same will happen with so called "assault weapons" if they try to place them in the same category. All this craziness is doing is justifying the actions of those who stocked up on suck weapons after Obama was elected the first time, and making the more entrepreneurial of them rich while doing it as they sell rifle's at online auctions or at gun shows at VAST markups over what they paid for them. Prices are going insane on high capacity capable rifles, their magazines, high capacity pistol and rifle magazines, ammunition of all types for those weapons (5.56mm NATO and 7.62 NATO along with 9x19 NATO/Parabellum and 5.7mm FN) are unobtanium, or at least run over $1 per round for ammo that was $0.33/rd one month ago and $0.17/rd before Obama was elected. So, we've restricted the 2nd Amendment to the rich . . . what's next . . .</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358655453140</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 23:17:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358655734409-13</Id><Topic><Title>Mr.President, stop the violence in the inter cities</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1358550463045</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 18:07:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Believe me as one who has to obey even the more obscure ones the existing laws are more than adequate if enforced correctly. That means actually USING the firearms laws currently on the books to prosecute violent criminals. That means making sure those same violent criminals are not now somehow otherwise getting hold of them. I know at least one person whose brother holds his since he got a felony bust. He's trying to get his firearms rights restored, but all things given it isn't likely, so now he has to keep his hands off the goodies. The only thing between him and those weapons is that they're locked up and his MOM has the key. Sound familiar? Fortunately he's not a nut and frankly is too laid back and social to be the lone gunmen type, but I'm just saying . . . The police didn't even make SURE he doesn't have access to his weapon, they just asked if he had any, he said yes and it was in the custody of his brother, they told him no guns for 5 years (something about the law he broke, I forget what it was) or until he could get a judge to say OK. So far it seems he'll wait the whole 5 years.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358655734409</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 23:22:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358656074449-14</Id><Topic><Title>UPDATED: 5 People Shot At 3 Different Gun Shows On Gun Appreciation Day</Title><Username>cindyreedindrag</Username><Timestamp>1358653360996</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 22:42:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Found like 2 more incidents, one at a MLK/Civil rights parade somewhere, and another outside a gunshow shortly after it ended. Lots of people out there who have NO freaking clue how to handle the weapons they are responsible for. The "well regulated" portion of the 2nd amendment means "well trained", that means knowing which way to point the damn thing and how NOT to shoot people accidentally, at the VERY least. My lord I'd had 3 Firearms safety classes before my 16th birthday when I was finally allowed to spend some (all) of my own money on a Remington 870 shotgun so I could shoot Skeet more than one bird at a time (my first gun was a 2 barrel Savage 24C with a single open bored 20ga shotgun, not ideal for skeet, but I am good with it). I still have both those firearms. I don't often sell them unless I try them and find for some reason I dislike them. I only regret selling two. One of those will no doubt be on the ban list.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1358656074449</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-19 23:27:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
