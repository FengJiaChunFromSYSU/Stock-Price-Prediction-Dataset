The cars, not so much, at least until you start getting power for them from a fusion plant. Until then the net environmental impact of a hybrid car or a total electric car is higher than a gasoline powered car (including energy used in construction and environmental damage from battery manufacture) in any state where the primary power source is coal or fuel oil. Now ain't that something they forget to tell you. Of course if your juice comes from Hydro or Nuclear then it makes a bit more sense from an ENVIRONMENTAL standpoint. From a purely personal economic standpoint it doesn't. Neither does keeping power, musket, and shot, as current law only allows possession of up to 50 lbs of black powder (it is a HIGHLY volatile if low powered explosive even without compression) but I probably have the better part of a half ton of conventional ammunition. Though admittedly only a small fraction of that weight is powder, unified ammo being what it is. A standard musket or rifle shot burns 60 grains of black powder, while a junior rifle or pistol shot uses about 30 grains. Using grains to ounces determine how many rounds of standard rifle fire you have the powder for if your powder horn carries 8 ounces of powder. Also, assuming a flintlock rifle, how many flints, and how much priming powder can you carry? If you use a rifle, do you have a bullet mold and a spare for your rifle, and do you have at least one bullet mold per squad carrying a standard .60 caliber infantry musket? Being prepared is easier now than it was then. Now we only have to set aside some sealed cans of ammo and rotate them out ever decade or so by moving them to practice ammo stocks. Factory military ammo is fairly expensive afterall, and hunting ammo is normally prohibited for use by partisans by the laws of armed combat. Don't wanna break any international treaties do we?</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1366039844257</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 11:30:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366041716897-6</Id><Topic><Title>Single Digits......</Title><Username>billwilliselkins</Username><Timestamp>1366038036350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 11:00:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, SCHW did miss estimates, so it only makes sense that ETFC would go down 50% more than SCHW does....that's this stock for you.</Msg><Username>ualdayan</Username><Timestamp>1366041716897</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 12:01:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366042169215-7</Id><Topic><Title>Two Shot in Gun Shows.

When the batteries on my wheelchair die they go from "Hey I'm darn near full" to "Oh my God I can barely move" entirely too quickly. And, as batteries age, that time gets shorter and shorter. Now, once they design a battery that holds MORE power the more you use it, then it might be interesting. Until then the cost of a full battery replacement, or, if you throw them away after use, a new car every time the batteries need replaced, as well as the environmental damage from disposing of those batteries makes most electrical cars totally not worth it. Now there IS a new designed which using a two piston simultaneous stroke linear combustion generator to drive batteries or flywheels that looks sort of interesting, if they can get the bugs out of it. e.g. right now they haven't thought to put a flywheel on the braking system because the NTSB is worried about energetic flywheels getting loose in an accident, but soon they'll figure how a way to make such a design (I already have) and THEN we might see a REALLY low milage car that uses batteries as a temporary storage boost during acceleration, and otherwise depends on the flywheel and stored inertial energy. The only bad part is you have to leave it running for a bit at first if the batteries aren't charged so the weak little linear combustion engines (less horsepower than a large lawnmower) recharge your juice.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1366055640153</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 15:54:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366055740331-21</Id><Topic><Title>Bomb Explosion-Boston Marathon finish line</Title><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1366054691724</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 15:38:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another Bomb found.</Msg><Username>unluckyskankgerbil</Username><Timestamp>1366055740331</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 15:55:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366055772479-22</Id><Topic><Title>Gold's tanking...the markey next?</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1366050325591</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 14:25:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tax hikes and reduced government spending, over course the economy was going to start to slow.

Th Muslim Brotherhood is rolling on the floor laughing and shaking hands with Al Queda! Let's give them more money and military equipment, so that they can do greater damage! (Good timing!) Lets borrow more money from our "Buddies", the Chinese so we can throw it away for GREEN junk - out the window! Why change now - the Campaigner in Thief is on a perfect way to wreck this nation! Just like Benghasi, he doesn't call it terrorism, travesty? To me that's when my house gets blown away by a tornado, or the kid drowns - this is TERRORISM!!!
