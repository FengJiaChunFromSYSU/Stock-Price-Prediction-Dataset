BIG time? And you have single incident in the world history to support this claim? Be my guest. Communist China implemented elements of free market capitalism to boost its economy. But where else government raised people salaries to help economy and it produced results? - Their stock portfolios? Do you know it always goes up? Even if it does, profit is taxed 100% immediately toward $35K minimum wage. So the” fat cat” never gets a dime of profit unless he starts making regular income. You force them to become... Middleclass. Or poor. Your choice. And then, never even dream to become rich. Cause rich is to make poor happy. Obama dream. - And assets! This is about biggest misconception the left creates. Like they don't know that those who make a big buck today are on the road to create wealth(assets), not necessarily wealthy. So taxing them 100% is just cutting their way to ever become wealthy. Obama dream again. Taking away more than 50% of some people income, while another category pays nothing, is already immoral. But you have no problem taking away ALL from hardworking few to please youngsters behind McDonalds cashier stand?

One that it would take 100% of the income of the top 1% to meet that need. When I pointed out that there would be a huge surge in stock gains (and yes a 1.4 trillion yearly stimulis to the economy would cause the stock market to surge) you then through your horrible 3rd grade math changed the rules and stated that we would tax those gains as well at 100%. Of course my assumption in this imaginary scenario was that we would tax ONLY to meet the money needed to make the 35k minimum wage, you of course now change it to create a massive surplus. I am sure the math is beyond you. The areas where your math is horrible are everywhere in this absurd analysis. I will ad as well that the top 1% do not pay anywhere near 50% of their income in federal taxes. Not close. If we are simply doubling, even with your bad math, long term cap gains would only double to 40% of gains. and to be clear, in this absurd scenario, 99% of the people are not impacted negatively, only the top 1%. Now do I think this is good long term policy, no, but short term, yeah. Lets give it a shot for a couple of years, the opposite of Bushes tax cuts and see how it works. It cannot fail any worse than that idiotic tax policy.</Msg><Username>sec_fordummies</Username><Timestamp>1362504656965</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 12:30:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362504731151-12</Id><Title>Poll: 80% of restaurant workers spit in customers' food</Title><Msg>The other 20% admitted to blowing a load in customers food.

Bernanke, the Chairman, and his band of Bank Governors have DRAMATICALLY reduced the amount of interest that the Fed pays to Banks for their reserves...basically down to nearly 0%. This is the reason that banks pay so little interest on depositors' accounts...why would they borrow money from you, a saver, when they can borrow from the Fed for free? So, savers can't make any money by in savings accounts; they can't make much on government bonds (because the Fed is printing money like it is going out of style and lending that money to U.S. government at ridiculously low rates to finance our enormous debt); so the only place for savers to get any return on their savings is to put money in the stock market. If the Fed had not undertaken these unprecedented steps of QE1, QE2, QE3, and now what some are calling QE Infinity, the stock market would be MUCH lower than it is today, and Obama would never have won re-election because more and more of his budget would be going to pay for interest (at market rates) and less on actually delivering government programs. But people like you and I will pay for it in the long-run...because every time the Fed creates money out of thin air, it actually dilutes the value of the money that you have in your possession. This is why gold has gone up in value so dramatically over the past decade, as a hedge against monetary inflation. I do not give Obama credit for "saving" the economy. And I am not a supporter of the Repugnicans. Both sides are statists. The only things that I will give Obama credit for are: (1) getting bin Laden (yes it was on his watch as Commander-In-Chief); and (2) passing the Jobs Act last April, which is going to open up early stage investments to ordinary investors. Other than that, he has been a less-than-average POTUS.</Msg><Username>gorakrishna</Username><Timestamp>1362507252197</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:14:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362507577934-16</Id><Topic><Title>Poll: 80% of restaurant workers spit in customers' food</Title><Username>delucks354</Username><Timestamp>1362504731151</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 12:32:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The more creative disgruntled servers take hidden movies of candidates sucking up to big donors.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1362507577934</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:19:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362508143036-17</Id><Title>Consequences of letting GOP droolers legislate</Title><Msg>WASHINGTON -- A new short-term budget bill introduced on Monday by House Republicans includes a bizarre provision banning federal funding to anti-poverty group ACORN, despite the fact that the group has already been stripped of federal funding -- and has been defunct for nearly three years. ACORN leaders announced that the group was disbanding in March 2010, after Congress cut off all federal funding to the organization. The provision in the current GOP budget bill [PDF], buried on page 221 of 269, would duplicate legislation that has already passed, to target an organization that does not exist. ACORN, also known as the Alliance of Community Organizations for Reform Now, came under heavy fire in the fall of 2009 after conservative provocateur James O'Keefe released a set of selectively edited videos that appeared to show employees of the organization offering advice on tax avoidance related to prostitution and child smuggling. Independent investigations by the California attorney general, the Massachusetts attorney general and the Brooklyn, N.Y. district attorney would later clear ACORN of criminal wrongdoing, and an investigation by the Government Accountability Office would clear ACORN of charges that it mishandled federal funds. But the damage to ACORN's reputation had already been done. By November of 2009, Congress had defunded the organization, using broad language that applied to "any organization" that had been charged with breaking federal or state election laws, lobbying disclosure laws, campaign finance laws or filing fraudulent paperwork with any federal or state agency. The funding ban also extended to any employees, contractors or others affiliated with any group charged with any of those things. Nevertheless, Section 510 of the latest legislation, introduced by House Appropriations Chair Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), reads: "None of the funds made available in this Act may be distributed to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN)</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1362508143036</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:29:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362508241832-18</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Takes DOW to Record High</Title><Username>hugh_bris</Username><Timestamp>1362496847414</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 10:20:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"because every time the Fed creates money out of thin air, it actually dilutes the value of the money that you have in your possession" Yeah but there really has been no dilution.

New economic plan, the government will pay for your birth, healthcare, and "end of life" care, including a cremation; BUT, the estate tax goes to 100% with no lower or upper limits . . . Making you essentially chattel property of the government during your lifetime since you can leave no legacy behind. Hey, they just wanted me to float it by you, as that seems to be the only way to balance future budgets. And half of what you make DURING life goes directly to the government, no matter how little or how much you make in a year (if that makes you really poor they'll maybe give some back at the end of the year). That other 25% will be FICA for your later years when they issue you highly devalued checks. Don't worry though you still get to keep 25% of your pay (before state and local taxes) and you don't have ANY healthcare expense . . . . Particularly if you get swallowed by a sinkhole. I can see the government moving ALL the Veterans Homes to high risk sinkhole areas in Florida once they figure that part out.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1362511280092</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:21:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362511411760-28</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Takes DOW to Record High</Title><Username>hugh_bris</Username><Timestamp>1362496847414</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 10:20:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the market is not currently overpriced relative to interest rates...but would likely be overpriced if we had more normal interest rates. and remember, much of the earnings growth over the past couple of years has come from corporations refinancing their debt at much lower interest rates. at some point, that cycle will end.</Msg><Username>gorakrishna</Username><Timestamp>1362511411760</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 14:23:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362511552114-29</Id><Topic><Title>Florida sinkhole kills a man in his own bedroom, thanks Obama.</Title><Username>project2069</Username><Timestamp>1362168932562</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 15:15:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>awesome post.

If you can get a price/book stock of .6 or less and a P/E under 15 at this price then you're crazy not to buy unless the stock is laden with variable interest debt which might cause inflation to wipe out gains. There are plenty of outright steals out there including Corning Glassware, which makes quite a bit more sophisticated products as well, and makes panes for LCD screens, nano materials, other things, and is partnered through secondary companies with other big hitters. PLUS it pays a dividend. Apple computer with 1/3 or so of its current stock price IN CASH, a P/E under 10, a P/B of about 3 which ONLY counts their cash, ignoring their real estate, intellectual property, etc . . . Now is the time to buy, during the bust, when prices make easy deals lay around like money to be picked up off the ground.

John Brennan's installation at the spy agency has been delayed as Senate Democrats and Republicans have pressed the Obama administration to allow a review of the classified documents prepared by the Justice Department. The senators have argued they can't perform adequate oversight without reviewing the contents of the opinions, but the White House had resisted requests for full disclosure. The intelligence committee's chairwoman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a statement Tuesday that the committee voted 12-3 to send Brennan's nomination to the full Senate for confirmation. The panel's deliberations were held behind closed doors. Feinstein did not identify the senators who voted against Brennan.</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1362533155154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 20:25:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362533931581-48</Id><Topic><Title>We Are Not Done Sequestering</Title><Username>saywhat_1999</Username><Timestamp>1362239710969</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-02 10:55:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kill GOP.

The Dow Jones industrial average, which measures the performance of 30 blue-chip companies, rose more than 80 points at the start of trading on Tuesday, to 14,207.94. That surpasses its previous record close of 14,164.53, which it achieved nearly five and a half years ago, as well as its record intraday high, set around the same time, of 14,198.10. Of course, a few things have happened since October 2007.

It is enacted by US Congress in 1996, way before Obamacare came to town.

So, if this is a real life case, and your friends didn’t bring this to court it is due to their own pure ignorance. So, my question back to you, if insurance provider can still drop anyone’s policy against the law, how does Obamacare fixed it? Obamacare “fix” is to give all power to same providers which can neglect the law? So, please! Give me a break. You may know those victims. I don’t.

For Romney, however, giving poor people health care represents “the power of incumbency.” Which is to say, it’s a political bribe. Romney said so more explicitly in a conference call with donors a week after the election in which he explained that Obama had used the “old playbook” of offering goodies to certain groups—“especially the African-American community, the Hispanic community, and young people”—to lure them to the polls. Romney, by contrast, had spent the campaign “talking about big issues for the whole country: military strategy, foreign policy, a strong economy, creating jobs, and so forth.” Whether Romney realizes it or not, the implication is clear: white and old people put aside self-interest to think about what’s best “for the whole country.” Young, black, and brown people leech off the government and flock to the polls to reelect the black president who helps them do so. Romney isn't wrong in that elections are about gifts. Politicians have to deliver for their constituencies, and those who do the best job of delivering are the ones who get elected. Where Romney might be wrong is the notion that only brown and young people want "gifts." All those corporate PACs aren't dumping millions into elections out of altruism. They want tax breaks and preferential treatment and policies that #$%$ their competitors and critics. Hence, Big Oil supports the party that will squash those Green Energy upstarts and refuses to do anything about global climate change. Wall Street wants to get those pesky regulations off their backs so they can continue making money off risky ventures, fully expecting to be bailed out next time they screw up (and there will be a next time). Defense contractors want more contracts for ships and planes and tanks that the Pentagon doesn't want, doesn't need, and have no place in modern warfare. You see? Gifts!</Msg><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1362537851210</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 21:44:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362537945303-56</Id><Topic><Title>BO the Conqueror</Title><Username>q4dike</Username><Timestamp>1362532227182</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 20:10:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You see?

Neocons want more wars, because senseless death and mayhem give them bizarre gratification. Theocons want their bigotry enshrined in law. Gifts, gifts, gifts! Democrats are winning because our gifts are more relevant to people's lives than theirs. We offer health care, education, a living wage, and a focus on building stronger families and communities.

Buzzfeed reported on Friday the Foreign Agent Registration Act filing shows that conservative writers whose work appeared in The Huffington Post, Washington Times, National Review and RedState, among others, were part of a paid propaganda campaign by the government of Malaysia. Trevino — who before he parted ways with Guardian told POLITICO in 2011 that he was “never on any ‘Malaysian entity’s payroll” — received $389,724.70 from the “government of Malaysia, its ruling party, or interests closely aligned with either” from May 2008-April 2011, according to the document. The filing also lists 10 others who were provided with stipends for their writing, including Ben Domenech, the Transom blogger who received $36,000.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1362541091790</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 22:38:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362541430227-62</Id><Topic><Title>Michelle, going to the dogs!</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1362438582283</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 18:09:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He likes dog so much he married one</Msg><Username>barryfromthehood</Username><Timestamp>1362541430227</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 22:43:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362542982148-63</Id><Topic><Title>GOP mercenaries busted</Title><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1362541091790</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 22:38:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BuzzFeed reports: Trevino's subcontractors included conservative writer Ben Domenech, who made $36,000 from the arrangement, and Rachel Ehrenfeld, the director of the American Center for Democracy, who made $30,000. Seth Mandel, an editor at Commentary, made $5,500 [...]. Brad Jackson, writing at the time for RedState, made $24,700. Overall, 10 writers were part of the arrangement. "It was actually a fairly standard PR operation," Trevino told BuzzFeed Friday. "To be blunt with you, and I think the filing is clear about this, it was a lot looser than a typical PR operation. I wanted to respect these guys' independence and not have them be placement machines." Russia has worked similar setups, weaseling positive press onto HuffPo and CNBC through shady PR operations under the guise of independent commentary. In this case, HuffPo has deleted one of the articles about Malaysia in question. An editor's note now reads, "This post was removed from The Huffington Post after it was revealed that the author violated our blogger guidelines by not properly disclosing financial ties that amounted to a serious conflict of interest." (Update: "This is a clear violation of HuffPost's blogging policy that requires disclosure of payments and conflicts of interest," said a spokesperson. "As soon as we learned of this conflict, we removed the posts from our site.") Treviño, whom Glenn Greenwald once called "among the lowliest, most extremist cretins that exist," was hired as a columnist by the U.S. version of the Guardian last year, only to be fired before writing anything when his mostly undisclosed ties to Malaysia came up. Back then, he told the New York Times that he had finally "made the move into full-time writing," but now works for the Texas Public Policy Foundation. "I'm not even slightly insulted at being told I'm not a real journalist," Treviño wrote today on Twitter, where he's taking questions about the Malaysian gig. "Feel free, but it ain't a thing here.</Msg><Username>stock_trader_00l</Username><Timestamp>1362542982148</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 23:09:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
