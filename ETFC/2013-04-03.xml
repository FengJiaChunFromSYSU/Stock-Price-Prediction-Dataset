Tens of thousands Obamacare 'navigators' to be hired Tens of thousands of health care professionals, union workers and community activists hired as "navigators" to help Americans choose Obamacare options starting Oct. 1 could earn $20 an hour or more, according to new regulations issued Wednesday. The 63-page rule covering navigators, drawn up by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, also said the government will provide free translators for those not fluent in English -- no matter what their native language is. "The proposed requirements would also include that such entities and individuals provide consumers with information and assistance in the consumer's preferred language, at no cost to the consumer, which would include oral interpretation of non-English languages and the translation of written documents in non-English languages when necessary to ensure meaningful access," said the regulations. The rules also addressed conflict of interest and other potential issues that navigators could face as the public's first stop on the Obamacare trail.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1365021228639</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 16:33:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365022769821-24</Id><Topic><Title>Eleven children escaped Newtown classroom while Adam Lanza was reloading</Title><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1364999144744</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 10:25:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rowdy...I almost said the Mind of the person holding the gun; but I didn't wan't to set JB off onto another tangent...</Msg><Username>lackofzzzzzz</Username><Timestamp>1365022769821</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 16:59:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365023218020-25</Id><Topic><Title>yep, tax cuts for the rich did no good for the economy, they just made the rich richer and everyone else poorer</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1364932336604</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 15:52:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey stupid, did you miss it that republican Ben Stein was one source I showed for the FACT that the tax cuts have have never helped the economy or increased production..... all the tax cuts did was make the rich richer and the poor poorer and even some conservative republicans say the same, as did Ben Stein.</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1365023218020</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 17:06:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365023563458-26</Id><Topic><Title>conservative Ben stiein also agrees that lower taxes on the rich never did any good for the economy</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1364932237020</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 15:50:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Declining Tax Rates Haven’t Stimulated Investment: Cutting taxes on the richest Americans has not led them to invest more in plant and equipment. Over the past 50 years, as tax rates have declined, there has been no increase in investment spending as a percentage of GDP. (The flat trend line shows that changes in the highest marginal income-tax rate have not affected investment much, one way or the other.) Instead, the investment share of the economy has been determined by other factors, such as aggregate demand, rather than tax policy Lower Taxes, Slower GDP Growth: Despite lower and declining tax rates, especially on the rich, the United States has had slower productivity growth over the last several decades than other advanced economies. Overall, lower taxes are associated with slower growth in GDP per hour worked. A 10 percentage point increase in taxes as a share of GDP is associated with an increase in the productivity growth rate of 0.2 percentage points. (See Figure 5.)

This is part of a national, partisan effort on the voter ID issue that does not wash when you consider the scrupulous nature of North Dakota voters.” Voter fraud in North Dakota is almost nonexistent. After the 2012 general election, officials identified nine alleged cases of voter fraud out of 325,862 votes cast, or 0.0000276 percent. From 2000 to 2010, only one case of voter fraud was criminally prosecuted in the state. Indeed, North Dakota has been constantly singled out for its impeccable record when it comes to elections, with the state being recognized by the Pew Charitable Trusts as having the highest Election Performance Index in the country. In an interview just two months ago, Secretary of State Al Jaeger stated, “In my 20 years as Secretary of State, we’ve only had one or two or three cases of what we’d consider fraud.” Similarly, with its passage, the bill stands to create unnecessary costs to the state. According to the bill’s fiscal note requiring the NDDOT to provide non-driver’s license IDs free of charge would decrease state revenues by $204,087 per biennium. Additionally, the NDDOT estimates that the cost to produce and provide additional non-photo ID cards costs $12,296 per biennium. The bill will also unnecessarily restrict ballot access for elderly voters. According to AARP, 18% of elderly Americans do not have photo ID.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1365024324389</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 17:25:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365024789195-28</Id><Topic><Title>yep, tax cuts for the rich did no good for the economy, they just made the rich richer and everyone else poorer</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1364932336604</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 15:52:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It does not matter to him, in the end he believes that the wealthy are golden and deserve to pay zero taxes.

CO Democrat Doesn't Understand High-Capacity Magazines Can Be Reloaded CO State Rep. Diana DeGette (D) "I will tell you these are ammunition, they’re bullets, so the people who have those now they’re going to shoot them, so if you ban them in the future, the number of these high capacity magazines is going to decrease dramatically over time because the bullets will have been shot and there won’t be any more available."</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1365028623680</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 18:37:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365038289948-33</Id><Title>Weak Gun Laws &amp; High Levels of Gun Violence Go Together</Title><Msg>. Unsurprisingly, the states with the weakest gun laws tend to also be the states with the highest rates of gun violence. Here are the ten states with the highest levels of gun violence: Louisiana Alaska Alabama Arizona Mississippi South Carolina New Mexico Missouri Arkansas Georgia As both common sense and hard data indicate, 8 of these 10 states are among the 25 states with the weakest gun laws. Indeed, the 10 states with the weakest gun laws have more than double the rate of gun violence of the 10 states with the strongest gun laws. On the flipside, states with strong guns have low levels of gun violence. The five states with the lowest levels of gun violence — New York, New Jersey, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and Connecticut — are all among the ten states with the strongest gun laws.</Msg><Username>junglebobmaria</Username><Timestamp>1365038289948</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 21:18:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
