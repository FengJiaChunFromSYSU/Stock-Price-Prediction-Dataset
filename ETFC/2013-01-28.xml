The Fed stops printing money (allowing the market to set interest rates), which should lead to 2. Big expansion in NIM 3. Couple this with increase in accounts and assets 4. more long-term normalized DARTs (which I think are closer to 125,000) 5. more Option/Restricted Stock Management deals with fast growing corporations, which happens as companies get closer to going public. 6. Regulators allow ETFC to upstream $2B in excess capital from bank to parent, allowing parent to return capital to shareholders in some form (share buyback, call the new debt, dividend, etc.). Any return of capital in the form of dividend would have to be counted toward the $50 total price target (meaning if $5 is returned cumulatively between now and 2015, then I would expect a $45 price target).

Higher rates of recurrent major depression among gay men. Higher rates of anxiety, mood and substance use disorders, and suicidal thoughts among people ages 15 to 54 with same-sex partners.
