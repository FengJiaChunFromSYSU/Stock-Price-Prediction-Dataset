Here are some steps you will not want to miss. Start in school by enrolling in the easiest classes and then not showing up. When you must be present, be stoned. Under no circumstances crack a book. For extra loser-points, drop out and get a GED. Nothing says "quitter" like a GED. Try to pick up at least a few legal infractions along the way. Get knocked up or knock someone up early. Having a baby out of wedlock will later provide endless reasons to be gone when there is work to be done. Don't get married. If you do, get divorced quickly and make sure the lawyers get more out of it than you will ever have. Having a baby or three out of wedlock will give you endless reasons to be gone when there is work to be done. Now for your career: Some jobs involve responsibility, decision-making, long hours, travel or unpleasant conditions. These are to be avoided. Show up at your job with an electronic device and spend half of your time playing with it. If anyone tries to get you to answer any kind of question, start crying and then call in sick for the rest of the week. Bring your soap opera life of personal drama to work and let everybody know. Don't let them teach you anything. The first time they send you to any training, start biching and keep biching until they figure out where you belong. Other good techniques of the lower half are excuse-making, job-switching, gossip, complaining and feuding with your coworkers. You are on your way!! When no employer will count on you to accomplish anything, you can act like you are Joan of Arc and cry about the people that have more than you do.</Msg><Username>hydronicoctopussy</Username><Timestamp>1362418041847</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:27:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362419626079-9</Id><Topic><Title>Woodward to kick Obama's #$%$</Title><Username>boreheadisme</Username><Timestamp>1362093341245</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 18:15:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>People never could believe Obama was a liar and a goalpost mover until fellow libtart Woodward outed him.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1362419626079</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:53:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362423758302-10</Id><Topic><Title>Income of $34K puts you in the top half of USA taxpayers</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1362410282680</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:18:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The consumers are the job creators." No one ever gets the job from consumer. It's always the one who you call rich who creates and gives jobs. You, as all the socialist cabal on the left, have it all upside down, because you look at the world from moronic fairness point of view. It is producer who creates jobs and expands his business, Consumer doesn't demand iPads or iPhones. Consumer can live with land line phones and write ltters old fashion way dropping and pulling it out of mailbox. It took a priooducer to create everything new we have in our lives. It isn't consumer who pushed the progress and created hundreds of thousands if not millions of jobs just based on these little things. Why most of Americans live in private houses? Because some smart people found the way to make them affordable by building with cheap reliable materials and technologies to warm it up and provide basic needs for long term use. We could ride horses up until now if someone wouldn't decide to build a car based on internal combustion engines. All of those examples generated a huge pile of money for producer. Consumer only benefits from that. Read MItlon Fridman. You may learn something. Your socialist utopia will always fail and keeps people in the dark.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1362423758302</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 14:02:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362427438446-11</Id><Topic><Title>Income of $34K puts you in the top half of USA taxpayers</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1362410282680</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:18:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeap.

Christina Romer on the Minimum Wage</Title><Msg>David Henderson Former Obama economist Christina Romer--she was the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers--has a good, though not excellent, piece on the minimum wage in the New York Times. In it, she departs from her ex-boss's views and points out some of the pitfalls of raising the minimum wage. Two excerpts follow. On why the minimum wage is not what assures high wages for workers: Many of my students assume that government protection is the only thing ensuring decent wages for most American workers. But basic economics shows that competition between employers for workers can be very effective at preventing businesses from misbehaving. If every other store in town is paying workers $9 an hour, one offering $8 will find it hard to hire anyone -- perhaps not when unemployment is high, but certainly in normal times. Robust competition is a powerful force helping to ensure that workers are paid what they contribute to their employers' bottom lines. On the effects of the minimum wage on employment: A related issue is whether some low-income workers will lose their jobs when businesses have to pay a higher minimum wage. There's been a tremendous amount of research on this topic, and the bulk of the empirical analysis finds that the overall adverse employment effects are small.</Msg><Username>slayer98_l</Username><Timestamp>1362432516045</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 16:28:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362433266607-15</Id><Topic><Title>Red hott!!

Never in human history. Individual company management can always make their own decision on how to treat its employees, not for philantropical reasons, but to be able to successfully compete with others. What makes particular company to make its internal decisions is none of my or your business. They are not doing it on government orders, it is, simply put, free market forces in place. Ford is doing what's beneficiary for Ford Motors Company only. Other companies lay off people, cut their working hours, cut benefits, furlough. Never asked question why aren't they all do what Ford did? Because they can't. And if you disagree, than try runnig your own business and see how it works in real life, not in your uneducated imagination. I learn from greatest minds who ever lived and shared with us ideas how the world really works.
