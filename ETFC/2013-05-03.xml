What a waste of money again by Obimbo, Michelle and Biden to travel to Minneapolis to push their anti gun laws through. (First of all St. Paul is the Capitol, but they might not have know that?) Reason Obimbo went to Minneapolis was another PHOTO-OP where the shooting in a small company took place and Biden after a school shooting in S-MN! And that just after MN rejected Obimbos Health Insurance Exchange program - now they facing Obimbocare in 2014 and don't know what to do with it, just like Prince Harry stated: We have a Menu, but don't know how to get to it"! He knows dorn well how to get there, he just wants to blame it on the republican again - a trap they wont fall for! Throw that whole #$%$ out the window. More OBIMBO FAILURES to come!

We all spoke here among us who know something about firearms, and curiously they listened to us instead of the basically uninformed "anti-gun" crowd. Not a terrible surprise there, even relatively fanatical politicians can come to the right decision when faced with facts that don't support the efficacy of their proposed legislation. Of course you couldn't explain ANYTHING to Nancy Pelosi, so she'll go right on pushing gun laws no one wants, but for most the idea that somehow criminals won't tend to obey gun laws seems to pretty much make the case that this is a problem that can't be solved by legislation but rather education. You want people to not treat deadly weapons like toys, then you want to start education early, intensively, and at all grade levels in a method appropriate to that level. Basic safety only until Junior High follow by NRA Junior rifle (.22 caliber rim-fires at 50 feet, single shot only) and progressing to more advanced competitions later as electives. Teach people what firearms can do, teach them to shoot, and you'll have considerably less issue with impulsive use of firearms, less stupid accidents, fewer suicides, but more people that someone deliberately wanted dead, and probably more from a distance where "getting the license plate number" isn't going to be happening.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1367603810098</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 13:56:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367604829429-14</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat logic</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1367598596906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 12:29:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why not whine about the billions spend for coronary heart disease, a disease of lifestyle (99% of them due to being fat and or smoking).. if you are fat and smoke and eat too much red meat you are going to clog your arteries and need bypasses like D.

They aren't quite the same thing, although there is strong correlation. Neither are all Republicans "Conservatives" although its a pretty fair assumption in most cases. And you got the phrase wrong, it goes, "15 year olds who want morning after pills are adults, 25 year olds who won't buy insurance are children." Please not that most young adults don't buy insurance because it goes against their personal interest to buy insurance when they're at low probability of needing it and a social safety net already exists that would catch them if they got unlucky at a very time when they need every cent to get started, in other words, making a perfectly rational choice based on the economic conditions at hand. Remove the safety net and the equation changes, but Obama et al don't want to change the equation. they just want to make everyone ignore it.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1367610243076</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:44:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367610368614-20</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat logic</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1367598596906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 12:29:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very well build and may get pregnant?

Rules from the EPA added significantly to both sides of the ledger. “It should be clear that the rules with the highest benefits and the highest costs, by far, come from the Environmental Protection Agency and in particular its Office of Air and Radiation,” the OMB study said. EPA regulations accounted for between 58% and 80% of the benefits the study found as well as 44% to 54% of the costs.

The weapon, a small rifle, was manufactured specifically for children’s use. The boy’s weapon was a “My First Rifle” .22-caliber gun from Keystone Sporting Arms’ youth branch, Crickett’s website markets itself “especially for youth shooters.” The firearms come in several neon colors, and the website even has a “kids corner” featuring pictures of small children with guns: Crickett does not manufacture bullets. The company offers books for “Grades 2-3 and up,” and says their guns are “ideally sized for children four to ten years old.” The militarization of children has been tragically spotlighted in the aftermath of the horrific shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut last December. Since then, the country has paid heart-sickening attention to the myriad accidental shootings that have taken place around the country, and the growth of a market of bulletproof children’s clothing. In one week alone last month, four people were shot by toddlers.
