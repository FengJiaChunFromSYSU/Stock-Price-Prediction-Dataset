Just wanted to keep some margin power. So I added calls when it was in the 9.95 neighborhood. The margin was used up because I sold 100 contracts of $11 put averaging about 75 cents, for next week expiration, and I sold too too many puts on Etfc Jan2014/2015 $10/$12 strikes. Also, I sold 160 contracts of CY $11 puts for this month, and numerous Sept. and Jan14 CY puts, plus more puts on CRUS etc. I closed INTC and ORCl puts at a small profit, too early, but had to do it since ETFC was disappointing, going to $9.87 to pose danger to my margin balance level. In any case, the foreclosure is to become a relic.

Investment income suffers a degree of risk that regular working income doesn't, and therefore deserves to be taxed differently, something with which President Obama apparently agrees as he left untouched the 100% long term gains exemptions individual incomes less than a quarter million a year. Frankly it's how I've gotten away with paying little to no federal tax since 2001 despite doing fairly well with my brokerage account from when I opened it until I mostly withdrew from the market in 2007 ahead of the housing collapse. I got back in 2009 after Obama was elected and haven't had a positive net gains year since then. I was investing in the wrong companies. The one's I invested in didn't have significant government patronage and minimum regulatory oversight as the companies that have created this new market bubble have.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1365658575545</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 01:36:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365659866770-7</Id><Topic><Title>Short Interest as of 3/28/13</Title><Username>billwilliselkins</Username><Timestamp>1365611644955</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:34:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it means there is considerably more buy interest than just the retail sector.

IF they would have dumped all those shares on the open market then STOPs would have been taken out, the price would have almost bottomed, shorts would have covered on the cheap, and longs would have felt the Citadel action to be entirely vindictive.

He comes in, we chat with him for a bit while we pry open his chest, and we insert a fresh heart. Then he’s on his way.” Doctors also revealed that Cheney is thriving under these conditions and will likely continue to live for many, many, many years to come."

He stated other laws could be used to prosecute an adult for engaging in sex with a minor and that the Virginia General Assembly would likely have authority under the Lawrence decision to pass a new law specifically outlawing sodomy between an adult and a minor."
