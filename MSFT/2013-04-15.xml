Here's a formula and an another point, money supply is equal to "printed money" times "the velocity of money". People confuse money supply with printed money. What happened in the 1930s and in the recent financial freeze is that the velocity of money dropped, therefore bring down the money supply below what was needed for the level of GDP. You need a given money supply for a given level of GDP, or suffer deflation or inflation. We would have had a worse contraction if the Fed didn't use QE. As velocity picks up the Fed can sell the securities back. They can do it other ways, but it can be done ... could require some finesse. The Fed saved our rear ends. QE3 is not for the velocity of money reasons, but to simulate further. Something we ask the Japanese to do a while back. But that can be withdrawn like the earlier QEs.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1366055404066</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 15:50:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366055753854-66</Id><Topic><Title>What does not add up is why bad fiscal news should be 'unexpected' as they keep sayihng</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1366045427615</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 13:03:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As long as Obama trashes every other investment besides the stock market the market will continue to rise.

Who pays that back? The taxpayers." It doesn't matter what the security is (treasury, mortgage back, etc) that the Fed sells back to the private sector. Either way the Fed soaks up the dollars. First of all the treasury comes from deficit spending, and not from a Fed induced situation. It was induced fiscally by over spending and, I agree, that could eventually become a problem. The Fed printing to buy that treasury in a QE situation doesn't increase the number of treasuries out there ... they buy it from the private sector. With deficit spending (non QE) the Fed prints to buy the treasury from the "Treasury". It then can decide to sell it to the private sector or hold it on their balance sheet ... depends on the current monetary policy.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1366056996681</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 16:16:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366060097849-69</Id><Topic><Title>Is Windoze 8 now the Yugo of Software???</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365722653582</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 19:24:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Q.

Google is still the runaway king of search and Microsoft is showing little signs of offering up meaningful competition. Microsoft is taking a beating with Bing, and CNN reports that the search engine is losing Microsoft almost a billion dollars per quarter. Since Bing launched in the summer of 2009, Microsoft has lost $5.5 billion on the service and the losses are flowing faster than ever today. Not all of the losses can be blamed on Bing though. Apparently, Microsoft has never made money on its search offerings. Since it embarked into search arena, the total mount thrown away amounts to $9 billion. ----------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366060317951</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 17:11:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366060441638-71</Id><Topic><Title>Zune Watch?

The QE action didn't create any new treasury, so no new debt was created. They were just giving the printed money back to the private sector (adjusting money supply to meet their objectives). Actually, the Fed does these kind of operations in normal times all the time to fine tune their monetary objectives ... just not to this degree. They are easing now and can tighten later by selling them back, but it has no bearing on the deficit or total debt. (This is different than the Treasury issuing a treasury to finance the deficit. The Treasury will try to sell it to the private sector and if they don't buy it, the Fed is required by law to purchase it. The Fed is doing that, but it is not part of the $85 billion/mo) Hopefully, the economy starts humming, velocity returns to normal, and they can withdraw the "printed money" and nobody will notice it happening ... but I'm sure it won't happen that smoothly, but it theoretically could be done. They will probably do it and at the same time move to increase interest rates slowly. Just depends on what they face with the economy at the time.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1366070077725</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 19:54:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366070172011-87</Id><Topic><Title>Zune Watch?

But it so far is not diluting the value of the dollar, though it could if they don't withdraw in time. Inflation isn't moving any more than it was prior to the QE's. If I told you that it takes a given money supply to support a given level of GDP, and money supply = velocity times "printed money". And I further tell you that the (normally constant) velocity just dropped off a cliff. What would you do to keep money supply at the appropriate level? What would you do? In the 1930s, money supply contracted and there was deflation. The Fed didn't tighten ... they just didn't recognize that velocity dropped. A year or so ago, I was really worried about the EU. The ECB had no mechanism to do a QE if velocity dropped (it normally is a constant, and I guess they didn't plan for it). The EU could have suffered severe deflation if velocity dropped.) They were having a problem coming up with a solution that didn't include a moral hazard. Anyway, they came up with a way ... destabilization fund and attached other measures that would serve the same purpose.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1366071896855</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 20:24:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366072270546-93</Id><Topic><Title>Board scientist, what is that in the Google doodle exp(i*pi)=-1</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1366027748919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 08:09:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what hawfaeces pretends that he knows something about Complex Variables with his 70 IQ HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR AHR AHR HAR AHR AHR AHRAR HA RHHAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1366072270546</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 20:31:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366072402746-94</Id><Topic><Title>Tax day today.

And he said if those conditions change (one or the other), he would stop it. He fully understood it was the "pushing on a string" idea, but there was a chance that string might be stiff enough. Maybe not, but heck, things were weak, inflation was within targets and fiscally there was the fiscal cliff and sequester coming up. We'll see how it goes ... and he can back out of it. If the economy strengthens before inflation, we may come out of this without the economy even noticing the Fed backing out. Commodities are dropping ... that will be good for the consumer. We may finally be seeing the end of the disastrous Commodities Modernization Act of 2000 which deregulated derivatives ... including commodity swaps. (That's another topic, but really ought to be understood if that is what is going on.) Correcting that was painfully slow.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1366076937693</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 21:48:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366076982620-108</Id><Topic><Title>the problem is the ratio of production to consumption</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1366075773915</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 21:29:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Asian factory workers are happy with a $300 a month salary, American factory workers want more than $300 a week and full benefits.

It's been a worldwide effort. Recently there have been transparency requirements put on commodity swaps ... position limits failed in a court case (commodities skyrocketed the next day), but it is looking like position limits will eventually be imposed ... as it is in the futures' markets. The transparency requirements may have done the trick though ... nobody like to be seen in compromising positions when the lights come on. Recently, there was an article that said many swap funds are moving to the futures market and giving up on the swap gig (The reason given is the small cost advantage of futures when you take in the new transparency rules for swaps ... but there are position limits in futures ... so, it may just be a way of saying they are giving up since they can't take up positions like they use to.) People have been tiptoeing towards the door for weeks, maybe months, but today everyone ran for it. We'll see, I've been waiting for this ... I hope it is the case because it will be really good for the economy.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1366080719498</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 22:51:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366081898400-111</Id><Topic><Title>Evaluation Finds Windows 8 to be Unusable and Even User-Hostile</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365710385149</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:59:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Windows 8 will kill MSFT just like digital photography killed Kodak!</Msg><Username>southwankers</Username><Timestamp>1366081898400</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 23:11:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366081971972-112</Id><Title>Windows 8 will kill MSFT just like digital photography killed Kodak!</Title><Msg>The worst product ever introduced.

I don't why you feel I said that. As a matter of fact I would say that the QEs didn't cause commodities to go up as the media many times portrayed. QE is not making the stock market go up. The earnings are real and companies are lean. Just the opposite of 2000. However, I would say that without the QEs the economy would be worse and the market with it ... so in that respect there is a connection between the market and QE. I'd watch commodities ... if this is lasting, it will help the consumer.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1366083125863</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 23:32:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366083179140-115</Id><Topic><Title>Evaluation Finds Windows 8 to be Unusable and Even User-Hostile</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365710385149</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:59:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Brian Boyko has zilch credibility to evaluate Windows and Microsoft products- he is a known short and basher who wont admit it -mostly because he continuously loses money with his shorting</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1366083179140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 23:32:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366083349200-116</Id><Topic><Title>What does not add up is why bad fiscal news should be 'unexpected' as they keep sayihng</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1366045427615</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 13:03:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I meant to say, "I don't know why you feel I said that it did create wealth."</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1366083349200</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 23:35:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366083439578-117</Id><Topic><Title>the problem is the ratio of production to consumption</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1366075773915</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 21:29:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>other wise known as lack of consumer demand due to too little money in the pockets of the prospective consuming public due to loss of consumer credit or job layoffs or governmental spending or yes the stupid raising of taxes when the economy is too weak to support it</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1366083439578</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 23:37:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
