The Regime was complicit in causing the deaths because of political purposes, and total irresponsibility, and then scrambled to get everyone's story straight. Rice couldn't go on enoiugh tv. shows, and perpetrate the lie about what caused the attack long after the Regime was forced to change their story. Obama never even held a meeting on the Benghazi attack. That early morning meeting was already a scheduled meeting. They send Hillary off to S. America so she can't be questioned. About as low life a folks as one could imagine. And the guy that did the video that came out months before the attack, and no terrorist reaction to the video months after it came out...not even any outrage...is till in jail for causing the attack I do believe!</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1370522682916</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 08:44:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370523553520-22</Id><Topic><Title>For those claiming Obama called Benghazi terror the next day in the Rode Garden</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1370516688807</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 07:04:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It doesn't matter, its a dead issue with no traction no matter how many posts you put up.

So let me try and point out a few points. 1. It may very well be true that Wii has more units sold, but that was because it had NEW TECH, and non-gamers could play without having to learn buttons and joysticks. I can assure you that many of those Wiis now since dust covered as the novelty has worn off. Here comes xbox one, NEW TECH. Talk to your tv/cable, split-screen with apps, integrate with your fantasy football, and of course play some games without a controller, - oh yea, and watch blue-ray movies. So you're saying this won't appeal to those same people that picked up the Wii as non-gamers? As for your title information, I'm afraid that Naughty Dog is a studio that makes playstation games. So I'm afraid I can't take that information as unbiased. One last thing, ALL CAPS is not proper internet etiquette.</Msg><Username>xtwinstarx</Username><Timestamp>1370524509139</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:15:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370524674994-25</Id><Topic><Title>AS TO GAMING CONSOL DISCUSSION, WIN. 8 WAS BOGGED DOWN WITH CONFIG.

Rice said what she was told to say, because that's what they thought at the time, and what they chose to reveal at the time. She even said something like or did say what we know at the time. That is not lying in any way. Rice didn't lie The President doesn't lie. Get over that stereotype you carry. Rice had nothing to do with benghazi and was talking about it on TV. Rice doesn't speak for the President. She could call it an ice cream social to me, what am I going to do with the information anyway? Come here and whine about it? It doesn't matter one whit what they named it down the line on TV. Maybe the CIA wanted to not show their cards just yet? Ever think of that? In any case Obama, nor Rice or Clinton, did anything wrong, it's a witch hunt. A political witch hunt. An evil attempt to score points towards the next elections. The tea party congress voted for less embassy security funding. Is that it? You should be ashamed of yourself leaping to blame the POTUS for each and every tragic event or anything that goes wrong, without a shred of evidence. I call that TREASONOUS on your part.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1370529020645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 10:30:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370529409184-40</Id><Topic><Title>Haswell and Broadwell will end AAPL and Google for good....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366945772947</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 23:09:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When the wonton suxtard shill gets his head handed to him he starts calling people bots like a whiney girl.

They don't even know anything is going on, nor do they have any curiosity or concern with regard to the meaning or safeguarding of their liberty. The accumulated unethical and illegal activities of this administration, not unlike the accumulation of debt, surpass all other previous administrations combined. Yet their brazenness will ensure that the news-averse, soma-addled masses will only get sanitized snippets, secure in the knowledge that nothing will come of it all. Sorry I've turned so pessimistic at this point in my life and American history. These low information voters are 50%+ of America now - past the point of no return. Not just a swing one way, and then we move back toward the center. Most Republicans have been moved far left of center - they now simply want to avoid having to talk about the social issues that hold the country together, or allow it to disintegrate into secular progressive oblivion. Despite the complete incompetence and lack of ethics we are dealing with today, America is just as likely to elect another radical, leftwing, progressive liberal kook in the next election as they are a traditional, mainstream conservative. The fat lady is warming up in the wings.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1370531184072</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 11:06:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370531194916-54</Id><Topic><Title>IF NEW XBOX IS AS BAD AS OS 8, THE WII WILL EAT MSFT.

He eclipsed both the greedy pseudo-envirokook Algore and frenchman John F. Kerry in real world leadership experience, strength, integrity, character, faith, family, and love for country. True conservatives didn't like Bush's encroachment with the Patriot Act, because we knew that people of character who will use power with integrity aren't always in the White House. And here we are. I vote to "primary out" RINO's like Bush.

The piece is presented as though it contradicts Susan Rice's claim that she was following her talking points. But that isn't what the story actually says: Officials said that although there was no question that the attack was terrorism, they did not know whether they were spontaneous or planned long in advance. They also did not have the suspects' identities. That's why, they said, they kept their unclassified talking points for Rice vague to avoid compromising future legal proceedings.

Sony has yet to offer any indication of the PS4 price tag with those eager to snap up the device expected to have to wait until E3 2013 June for more details on the Nintendo Wii U rival.

Quote:- While Microsoft apologists focus on Windows continuing to be the dominant desktop operating system, they keep missing the two elephants in the room: Windows 8 continues to fall behind Microsoft's previous top operating system failure, Vista, and Windows is no longer the dominant end-user operating system when PCs, smartphones and tablets are considered. True, on the desktop, Windows 7 still ranks as the top operating system with 44.85-percent of all PC users, followed by the still popular Windows XP with 37.74-percent. Vista—yes the never-loved Vista—comes in at third with 4.51 percent. Despite the fact that finding and buying Windows 7 PCs has become increasingly more expensive and difficult, just try finding one in a retail store, Windows 8 share is growing but still comes in last at 4.27 percent. Worse still, Windows 8's month-over-month growth rate is lagging further and further behind Vista's dreadful 2007 adoption numbers. When comparing the operating systems when they were first launched, Windows 8's adoption rate in its first month trailed Vista by just over half-a-percent among PC buyers. Now, in their 8th month out, Vista's market-share numbers now lead Windows 8 by 3.64 percent. Needless to say, both lag far behind XP and Windows 7's numbers at similar points in their product life-cycle.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1370543896722</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 14:38:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370544005445-150</Id><Topic><Title>Didn't have to wait long this AM for the Obama scandal dujour</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1370524875720</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 09:21:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>{At least I have altered my votes...} We used to be able to do that.

ALL DOWNLOADS AND NOT ENOUGH</Title><Msg>If Microsoft decides to truly implement the security features preventing used games and eliminate the use of discs in the new console then a large amount of storage space will be needed. Most modern games take at least 4GB of storage space, which is no small amount. New games, especially games that use even higher definition textures and graphics, would take even more storage space akin to what we’re currently seeing on modern PCs (12GB+). If a need for more storage space arises there will be no possible solution other than to include local storage options, which would ultimately result in larger hard-drives being bundled with the Xbox 720. Hopefully this would also translate to Microsoft opening up storage options to allow third-party hard drives and external storage options like what is seen in the current PS3 model. Microsoft does currently allow users to take advantage of external storage drives on the Xbox 360, but there are limitations to what the external drives can do – one of them being Xbox 360 games cannot be installed to external drives.

Financial wealth grew to a record high of $70.3 trillion, the Federal Reserve said on Thursday. It was the biggest quarterly increase since the fourth quarter of 1999. Stock holdings climbed by about $1.5 trillion, while the value of real estate owned by households rose about $784 billion. The data could help explain why U.S. consumer spending has appeared relatively robust despite tax hikes enacted in January.

Apples and oranges, you misinformed, kool-aid addled kook. Bush's FISA only covered calls to overseas with the specific goal of counterterrorism surveillance. Obama's the new version (which is not just simply a renewal of the earlier act, the story the kooks are trying to proliferate) is covering ALL Verizon calls, made anywhere, for the ENTIRE Verizon customer base. A total abuse of the Patriot Act, and par for the Administration of Lawlessness. In addition, Bush was fully committed to the war on terror. Obama has rejected the war on terror in favor of "overseas contingency operations" and "workplace violence", and has recently declared the war on terrorism "over". No, my friend. The Obama FBI sought this broad new FISA order in April for the same reason the IRS has been targeting conservatives, the EPA has been targeting eeeeevilllllll corporations, and the administration is using bogus email accounts to communicate between themselves - DESTROY POLITICAL ENEMIES.

You start Obama off with your accusation, then skip right on to punishment, that's why you qualify with "I guess." Only in these fake scandals of late, even accusation is unfounded. To accuse someone at least they need to be somewhere in the picture. If you can find a picture of Obama telling Rice to make up a story, any story, then you have step one, accusation. You don't have that. That's called "witch hunting."

It's not doing 5-10% flux on a daily basis. At least not until xbox one surfaces the market. So, I don't really understand the shorts mentality of bashing day in and day out. Plus, only 100 million shares shorted. Thus, it will take perhaps a week to cover without much price increase. If they do it now when the tides are calm, it would be better for them. But if they wait until the xbox is out, with voice command and motion control, knowing that consumers will go nuts over this NEW technology, they will get slaughtered. But I get it, they are pinning on the general market pullback that will drag msft down along with it. It can happen but if a company is strong and has an innovative technology, that company may draw in more buyers as a safe haven in an unfriendly market, thus, causing more price surge in msft.</Msg><Username>microsoftd1ck</Username><Timestamp>1370557043988</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:17:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370557364609-223</Id><Topic><Title>EXPERTS AT ASK LEO, AND SUPPORT FOR 8 AT OMNI-TECH ALL SAY DOWNGRADE, GET 7 DITCH FAULTY 8</Title><Username>ides_baby</Username><Timestamp>1370548299141</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 15:51:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>8 is krappi...goes lower on word getting out. 8 stinks... phone a joke...bing greatest loser ever for a search engine... bing is spam... 8 is filled with malware.. and msft. under-performs apple goog. and the gen market....all facts...your hopium for xbox...is just hope...they have never lead... always play catchup...and the puppets dance...</Msg><Username>msft_victim</Username><Timestamp>1370557364609</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:22:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370557507465-224</Id><Title>why OH WHY DOES MSFT...LOAD KRAP LIKE BING AS A TROJAN??

Under this program, referred to by the Bush administration as the "terrorist surveillance program",[1] part of the broader President's Surveillance Program, the NSA was authorized by executive order to monitor, without search warrants, the phone calls, Internet activity (Web, e-mail, etc.), text messaging, and other communication involving any party believed by the NSA to be outside the U.S., even if the other end of the communication lies within the U.S. Critics, however, claimed that it was in an effort to attempt to silence critics of the Bush Administration and their handling of several hot button issues during its tenure. Under public pressure, the Bush administration ceased the warrantless wiretapping program in January 2007 and returned review of surveillance to the FISA court.[2] Subsequently, in 2008 Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which relaxed some of the original FISA court requirements. During the Obama Administration, the NSA has officially continued operating under the new FISA guidelines.[3] However, in April 2009 officials at the United States Department of Justice acknowledged that the NSA had engaged in "overcollection" of domestic communications in excess of the FISA court's authority, but claimed that the acts were unintentional and had since been rectified.[4]</Msg><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1370558295006</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 18:38:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370558379275-227</Id><Title>"YES WE CAN!" ... listen in on your private business without a warrant</Title><Msg>Credit to someone on Twitter as cited on NBC News.

Yep, Steve Ballmer doesn't have to lift a finger to make all that money because Google's smart phone manufacturers (HTC, Foxconn, LG and Samsung) are WILLINGLY honoring Microsoft's patents and paying between $8 to $12 per phone they make for Google. Oh, meanwhile Google's investors got stuck with a $12 BILLION write off for the purchase of Motorola whose patents were found worthless in U.S. and International Courts. Kling, Kling, Kling. That's the sound of patent royalties pouring into Microsoft's bottom line every time a Google phone is sold.

The admission came after Britain's Guardian newspaper published on Wednesday a secret court order authorizing the collection of phone records generated by millions of Verizon Communications customers. Privacy advocates blasted the order as unconstitutional government surveillance and called for a review of the program amid renewed concerns about intelligence-gathering efforts launched after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The revelation also put a spotlight on the handling of intelligence and privacy issues by President Barack Obama's administration, which already is under fire for searching the telephone records of Associated Press journalists and the emails and phone records of a Fox News Channel reporter as part of its inquiries into leaked government information. "The United States should not be accumulating phone records on tens of millions of innocent Americans. That is not what democracy is about. That is not what freedom is about," said Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont. The White House said strict controls were in place to ensure the program did not violate civil liberties, and emphasized that the collection of data did not include listening to the calls. "The intelligence community is conducting court-authorized intelligence activities pursuant to public statute with the knowledge and oversight of Congress," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. Republican Mike Rogers of Michigan, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said the program did not abuse civil liberties and told reporters it had been used to stop a "significant" terrorist attack within the United States, but did not give details. "It's called protecting America," added Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Leading members of Congress said the program had been going on for seven years. The White House and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said lawmakers were fully briefed. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the published court order pertained only to data such as a telephone number or the length of a call, not the subscribers' identities or listening to the actual calls. The order requires Verizon to turn over to the National Security Agency "metadata" such as a list of numbers that called other U.S. or international numbers as well as other information on the time and location of calls. The NSA is the main U.S. intelligence-gathering agency tasked with monitoring electronic communications. "Information of the sort described in the Guardian article has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States, as it allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities, particularly people located inside the United States," the senior administration official said. Verizon has declined to comment. It remains unclear whether the practice extends to other carriers, although several security experts and a U.S. official said that was likely. AT&amp;T Inc declined to comment. Representatives for other major carriers, including Sprint Nextel Corp and T-Mobile, could not be immediately reached or had no immediate comment.</Msg><Username>sargentfriday</Username><Timestamp>1370567976815</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:19:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370568081535-303</Id><Title>YUR 2 PRONGGED ATTACK AINT WURKIN...FIRST THE PRODUSCTS THEN THE POLETICS...WELL</Title><Msg>ITZ BUEN NOTICED...AN WEEEL TKIE CARE OF U...</Msg><Username>sargentfriday</Username><Timestamp>1370568081535</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:21:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370568119011-304</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Details Xbox One Used Games, Always Online (Source IGN)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1370566338548</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 20:52:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am not at concerned if the new xbox one isn't compatible with older xbox games. The older charger to iphone isn't compatible with new iphones, does that stop people from buying new iphones? With that being said, there are more than 20 different ways in which msft can now charge for their games and online games (and eliminate sharing and middleman-gamestop). 1) Subscriiption to each game access 2) Subscription to ALL game access 3) Monthly subs 4) yearly subs 5) subs to older games at lower rates 6) Online gaming subs 7) Subs with joint accounts to friends and family. BTW, the new Xbox with voice command and motion sensing to every body parts (even can detect your heart rate) of players.

I'm with isecore, the only ones that matter are Android and iPhone, and Android is curb-stomping iPhone in all the ways that actually matter. The only real downside to Android is that it's SDK is actually limited to only two languages, with the horrible Java being the primary language. I would have rather seen a C++/Qt combo, like Nokia no doubt would have done if they didn't go WP7 and abandon Symbian altogether. Blackberry stopped being relevant the instant Android and iPhone took the market, WebOS was a commercial flop that led Palm to sink and get vultured by HP, and anything with Windows on it outside a desktop machine is a laughable joke, and even then, Linux and OS X have been increasingly kicking Windows' #$%$ on the desktop since roughly 2006.</Msg><Username>shurlock_homes</Username><Timestamp>1370569020671</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:37:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370569085465-311</Id><Title>Xbox One belongs to NASA, now it is in your living room</Title><Msg>-Voice command -Can detect subtle motions to your hands, arms, legs, torso, head, and even detect your heart rate.

What I did was make a list of the more important desktop operating systems for PCs (from 1980 on) and rate them each on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being perfect for this era. I considered each one from the point of view of software quality and usability. That would include things like user interface, installation, device support, security, support from the OS makers, support from independent software and hardware makers, and reputation. There is a very key subjective element that was included: Did this operating system contribute significantly to the advance of the desktop operating systems at large. So, for example, NeXT Step and BeOS were never really viable in the marketplace, but they both had effect on operating system interface design. And, while Linux doesn't really compare in the usability dept., it has had a huge impact in forcing OSes to become more reliable.</Msg><Username>didya_hear</Username><Timestamp>1370569988860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:53:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370570010576-321</Id><Topic><Title>Xbox One belongs to NASA, now it is in your living room</Title><Username>kevinvests</Username><Timestamp>1370569085465</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:38:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he did wonders for priceline.</Msg><Username>kevinvests</Username><Timestamp>1370570010576</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 21:53:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370570093274-322</Id><Title>NASA WAS A GREAT INNOVATOR..THE DIAPERS YOU R NOW WEARING COME FROM TANG AND SHITNER</Title><Msg>Were's spock??

Republican Mike Rogers of Michigan, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said the program did not abuse civil liberties and told reporters it had been used to stop a "significant" terrorist attack within the United States, but did not give details. "It's called protecting America," added Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. Leading members of Congress said the program had been going on for seven years. The White House and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said lawmakers were fully briefed. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the published court order pertained only to data such as a telephone number or the length of a call, not the subscribers' identities or listening to the actual calls. The order requires Verizon to turn over to the National Security Agency "metadata" such as a list of numbers that called other U.S. or international numbers as well as other information on the time and location of calls. The NSA is the main U.S. intelligence-gathering agency tasked with monitoring electronic communications. "Information of the sort described in the Guardian article has been a critical tool in protecting the nation from terrorist threats to the United States, as it allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities, particularly people located inside the United States," the senior administration official said.</Msg><Username>didya_hear</Username><Timestamp>1370573886813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 22:58:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370573928049-356</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Now Making Almost As Much as Google When Every Android Phone Sells</Title><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1370564249210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 20:17:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, if you can't innovate, litigate.</Msg><Username>backinfulldistrust</Username><Timestamp>1370573928049</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 22:58:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370574024854-357</Id><Topic><Title>In 2007 Obama said loaning to those who could not repay was a "good idea"</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1370571790179</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 22:23:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have had this argument with you before, and went and showed you what he really said.

Namely, the crackdown on leaks. Williams and Stewart agreed that the administration has been “draconian” when it wants to be — but far more lenient when the leaks are advantageous to the White House. “Do you think they’re reading your emails?” Stewart asked, referring to the Justice Department. “Because I have emailed you and said truly filthy things.” Leaks “are a big part” of our democracy, Williams contended. “Leaks are how we have learned about a lot of stories, especially in the last 10 years — this so-called war on terrorism. I think we will find our way. The attorney general is in a rough spot over this and to a lesser extent, the president.” For Republicans “who have desperately thrown their proof at the wall,” Stewart noted these scandals are “worthy of scrutiny.” It partly comes with the territory of second terms, Williams added, pointing to Bill Clinton as an example. All leaks aren’t created equal, but the DOJ “criminalizing journalism” is “enormous,” Stewart pressed. He then questioned Williams about the off-the-record meeting Attorney General Eric Holder had with journalists. “I’ll only say this,” Williams replied. “It’s been unusual to be, in a way, on both sides of the war on terrorism. I have seen the end effect of a drone.
