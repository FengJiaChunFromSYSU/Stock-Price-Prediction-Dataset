Both of those companies come and go in my portfolio, typically being assigned at $29 and $77.50 levels, respectively. There's no need for outsized moves in order to capitalize on those relatively boring stocks.

Vringo Win Could Drain Google On the losing side, Google's defense against mobile software designer Vringo (NYSEAMEX:VRNG) did not hold up in court last Tuesday. Google's loss validated Vringo’s ownership of two Internet search filtering patents, and awarded Vringo damages of $32 million from Google and past defendants including AOL (NYSE:AOL), Target (NYSE:TGT), and IAC/Interactive (NASDAQ:IACI). This ruling, however, could actually end up costing Google much, much more. As originally pointed out by EXPstocktrader via Seeking Alpha, depending on the growth of these defendants over the next five years, total royalties collected by Vringo could be in the $500 million to $600 million range. Future suits might be in store for Vringo, reports Paul Quintaro for Bezinga. The most likely defendants? Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) both infringe on Vringo’s property with very similar patents.</Msg><Username>immglobal2012</Username><Timestamp>1352742708019</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 12:51:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352743918010-69</Id><Topic><Title>To Designers of Windows 8 - Where's the focus group data?</Title><Username>trader.quick</Username><Timestamp>1352742334938</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 12:45:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They always have a marketing study that proves that the new product is the best product ever.

"The United States will overtake Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world's top oil producer by 2017, the West's energy agency said on Monday, predicting Washington will come very close to achieving a previously unthinkable energy self-sufficiency. The forecasts by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which advises large industrialized nations on energy policy, were in sharp contrast to previous IEA reports, which saw Saudi Arabia remaining the top producer until 2035. "Energy developments in the United States are profound and their effect will be felt well beyond North America - and the energy sector," the IEA said in its annual long-term report, giving one of the most optimistic forecasts for U.S. energy production growth to date. "The recent rebound in U.S. oil and gas production, driven by upstream technologies that are unlocking light tight oil and shale gas resources, is spurring economic activity - with less expensive gas and electricity prices giving industry a competitive edge," it added. The IEA said it saw a continued fall in U.S. oil imports with North America becoming a net oil exporter by around 2030 and the United States becoming almost self-sufficient in energy by 2035.

Obama Won More Than 99 Percent Of The Vote In More Than 100 Ohio Precincts By Michael Snyder November 11th, 2012 Barack Obama received more than 99% of the vote in more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County, Ohio on election day. In fact, there were a substantial number of precincts where Mitt Romney got exactly zero votes. So how in the world did this happen? Third world dictators don't even get 99% of the vote. Overall, Mitt Romney received 30.12% of the vote in Cuyahoga County. There were even a bunch of precincts in Cuyahoga County that Romney actually won. But everyone certainly expected that Cuyahoga County would be Obama territory. And in most of the precincts that is exactly what we saw - large numbers of votes for both candidates but a definite edge for Obama. However, there are more than 100 precincts in Cuyahoga County where the voting results can only be described as truly bizarre. Yes, we always knew that urban areas would lean very heavily toward Obama, but are we actually expected to believe that Obama got over 99% of the votes in those areas? In more than 50 different precincts, Romney received 2 votes or less. Considering how important the swing state of Ohio was to the national election, one would think that such improbable results would get the attention of somebody out there. Could we be looking at evidence of election fraud hidden in plain sight? Perhaps if there were just one or two precincts where Obama got more than 99% of the vote we could dismiss the results as "statistical anomalies" and ignore them. But there were more than 100 precincts where this happened in the most important swing state in the nation. Maybe there is some rational explanation for the numbers that you are about to see. If there is, I would really love to hear it.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1352754552115</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 16:09:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352754973902-92</Id><Title>HZNP, going to go big in the morning, load cheap, $3.50 in the morning</Title><Msg>CC, and more news, shhhhhhhh</Msg><Username>dealerschoice10</Username><Timestamp>1352754973902</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 16:16:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352755238854-93</Id><Topic><Title>Even in third world countries, no one gets 99% and 100% of the vote</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1352754552115</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 16:09:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Google this: " Election Fraud?

And that's what the Republican convention was like, an arena full of rich people cheering for low taxes. The IB founder commercial just helped show the depth of the platform. See, the two-term Republicans crashed the banks. Then JM ran at the time of responding to the crisis. He was credible but lost. Then the current Republican platform is at a time of continuing accountability but their only platform was lower taxes for rich people. Suggest a platform for the Republican Party ? How about a return to the Glass-Steagall act ? Then conversion of coal burning plants to natural gas. Also, export of liquefied natural gas. (We have a lot of natural gas.) Then hydrogen fueling stations based on connections to natural gas lines. And then fuel-cell bus projects.

The Democrat convention was like an arena of marching, chanting, cheering cat-haters. Why cat-haters ? Well, the bird lobbies contribute to the Democrats and they have dozens of programs on public TV about cats overpopulating and about cats being murderers. Well you tell me, does BO have a cat ? Also, the Democrats gave big raises to minimum wage workers but now want them to buy health insurance. See, the Democrats want to structure your life and health insurance is just one example. The problem, of course, is that young people don't want to buy health insurance while older people who do want health insurance are a drain on the insurance pool. What else do we have on the Democrats ? I think they are using political steering committees to investigate airline crashes and they are finding the pilots totally at fault and the weather never insurmountable. (And close attention to the personal behavior of airline pilots may be an attempt to put airline pilots in therapy. Then that suggests a plan to make behavioral psychology the fabric of society.) Another problem here is a system of all the things that political steering committees could be used against and the mentality of the politician. (This could produce situations like Galileo going on trial for his life at the Vatican because of his astronomy. In other words, political platforms as anti-science.)</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1352765101068</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 19:05:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352765150041-103</Id><Topic><Title>Who Is Speaker Of The House, Bonehead Boehner or Grover Norquist?</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1352731318729</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 09:41:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who controlls the House..republicans or the demos....yep it is the rep.. nofe said..</Msg><Username>revodcam</Username><Timestamp>1352765150041</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 19:05:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352768497549-104</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Surface sales only 'modest'</Title><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1352748630512</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 14:30:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are a phuckwit.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1352768497549</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 20:01:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352772533297-105</Id><Title>I will be tawking MSFT down again tomorrow</Title><Msg>sell early you been warn by the market maker</Msg><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1352772533297</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 21:08:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352775211211-106</Id><Title>Stock heading lower sinofsky is out</Title><Msg>Shares will hit below 27 Crap!</Msg><Username>balmer_tim</Username><Timestamp>1352775211211</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 21:53:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352775549210-107</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. to overtake Saudi Arabia as top oil producer</Title><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1352750777195</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 15:06:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>only because they have the dial set on 2/3........out of 10</Msg><Username>denn56k</Username><Timestamp>1352775549210</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 21:59:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352775715684-108</Id><Topic><Title>I will be tawking MSFT down again tomorrow</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1352772533297</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 21:08:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes especially now that Sinofsky is out.</Msg><Username>balmer_tim</Username><Timestamp>1352775715684</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 22:01:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352776316765-109</Id><Topic><Title>Let's compromise and adopt Erskine Bowles with it's serious cuts</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1352769172881</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 20:12:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Republicans had a much better offer but gambled that Obama would not win a second term.
