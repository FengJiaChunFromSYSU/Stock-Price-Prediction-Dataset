However, I was thinking about this all day as a matter of magnitude. Each digit to the right introduces the possibility of error that is an order of magnitude 10 higher than the last digit. In your example above where we are apparently averaging weights of a person (or persons.) *** Adding up the weights gives a total weight of 763.6 lbs, which has 4 significant figures. *** To get the average, divide by 5. The 5 is an exact number, so you don't lose any significant figures by doing this. The *** exact answer is 152.72 lbs *** The answer rounded to 4 digits is 152.7 lbs. We can be pretty certain that the first digit of 1, for 100 pounds is accurate. We are surely certain that the person (or persons) we weighed, weighed AT LEAST 100 pounds! For the same reason, we are pretty certain about that 5 being at least 50 pounds. Thus we have a high degree of certainty that we measured and average weight of at least 150 pounds! Now we get to that 2. Well, we're pretty sure it was at least 2 pounds. So with a reasonable degree of certainty we can claim the average was at least 152 pounds. Then comes that decimal point and that 7 and 2 following the decimal point. And we wonder, "Should we round up that 0.7 to the next 1?" Well, now that would make our average 153 instead of 152. Just how accurate is that 0.7? We study our measuring equipment, our measuring technique and even as you point out weather the subject being weighed was still, unbalanced or wiggling while being measured. And we find that we are not all that comfortable with the accuracy of that 0.7. What it looks like is our "true" average is between 152 pounds and 153 pounds. Something like: 152.0 pounds</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358148890484</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 02:34:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358149195390-3</Id><Topic><Title>the first uncertain digit</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1358121544596</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 18:59:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$!

CHEEZE! ON RUBBER CRUTCHES! What it looks like is our "true" average is between 152 pounds and 153 pounds. Something like: 152.0 pounds 'less than' "True" Average 'less than' 153.0 pounds It is true that: 152.0 'less than' 152.7 'less than' 153.0 It is also true that: 152.0 'less than' 152.72 'less than' 153.0 If we REALLY believe soundly in that 7, then it would also be true that: 152.7 pounds 'less than or equal to' "True" Average 'less than' 153.0 pounds or: 152.7 'less than or equal to' 152.72 'less than' 153.0 [ASIDE: I am not a student of calculus. But this is looking very "calculsie" to me! X is approaching some limit but never getting there! Much like that classic Greek example: If Achilles, the fastest human ever, runs half the distance to some place; then half the remaining distance; then half the still remaining distance, and so on...he will NEVER get there but will continue to approach getting there! ] But as you (or the example) pointed out we DON'T really believe too soundly in the accuracy of that 0.7 and a whole magnitude of 10 less of that 0.02! Now just suppose our average calculation had come out to 152.72625. . . (PS that's a 5/8 after the 0.02...) Now cfury's original theorem claimed that the extra digits would be good significant digits. But since we DON'T even believe much in the 0.7 and even less in the 0.02 how much faith can we really have in the 0.00625? I would say whole magnitudes of 10, 100 and 1000 times less faith! Once again, I come back to the practical application of our average. I don't know, in the example given, weather we weighed one person five times (to get five numbers to average to a "true" weight) or weather we weighed five different people one time each, and thus have an average of five people. But it is clear our average is between 152 and 153 pounds. Does it really NEED to be more accurate than that?</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358149640961</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 02:47:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358150737774-6</Id><Title>Can a US President be a Dual Citizen of another Country?</Title><Msg>The State Department is maintaining a “counter-misinformation” page on an America.gov blog that attempts to “debunk a conspiracy theory” that President Obama was not born in the United States, as if the topic were equivalent to believing space aliens visit Earth in flying saucers.

America has no fixed classes! In America, there are no fixed classes. There are economic bands and people and families rise and fall among those economic bands. There is no "steady state working condition" for the poor or anybody else. If you go to some list, like Fortune's richest people in America, and compare this years list to 10 years ago, or 20 years ago or 30 years ago you will find new people enter the list and familiar names (families even) drop off the list. (By the way, you will also find this to be true about corporations. Yes, some last for decades. Others come and go as styles &amp; technologies change. For example: It use to be that Sears was "Where America Shops!" Not so any longer. Sears is foundering. Meanwhile, WalMart, which did not exist too many decades ago, is America's largest employer outside of the Federal Government.) It is also true that many people start out poor and work their way up the economic bands. Work, school, a personal business and prudent savings &amp; investment can lift people from a lower economic level to a better one, sometimes a much better one. 2. Next: the bottom 50%!!!!!!!!! Nit wit that means everybody who makes less than the median (or average) income. Once again you prove how little you know about statistics. HALF the people/families/households (50%) will ALWAYS make less than the median income, even if we are in a communist society! DUH! 3. working class would compete for wages destructively and a spiral of decreasing wages . . . The reality is that this does not happen, at least not forever. First, there is a concept called supply and demand. At any particular time there is a demand for labor and a demand for wages and they tend to meet each other at an equilibrium If an employer offers much less than the current market rate for labor they will not fill jobs. If employees demand excessive wages they will not find jobs. Here is an example: Around 2007, the Democrats took over Congress and pushed through higher minimum Federal wages, over Bush's veto. The long time Federal Minimum wage was around $5.25 per hour. The Democrats raised it to like $7.25 per hour. The reality was that here in NYC (and many other large urban areas) the Market Rate minimum wage was already around $8 to $9 per hour. If an employer didn't offer at least the Market Rate minimum wage nobody would take jobs the jobs offered. Admittedly, we've been in a nasty downturn for awhile. Employers have had the upper hand and have demanded more education &amp; more experience for more productivity and mediocre wages. But we've also had more and more people exiting the employment market. (Retiring early, taking disability, moving back home with Mom &amp; Dad, starting their own small business and so on.) Sooner or later we will get to a new equilibrium where things are more reasonable. This assumes, of course, that all other things remain the same...and they surely have NOT remained the same. The Obama Administration has pushed through at least 50,000 pages of new regulations (so says John Stossel) and major law changes, such as ObamaCare. Sarbanes-Oxley Law; Frank-Dodd Law. Debt Crisses, Debt Limit Crisses; Presidentail &amp; Congressional Campaigns. The result of these is that they all torque the employment market, sometimes in unexpected an undesireable ways. 4. End result would look a lot like massive poverty and suffering for the bottom 50% This is balderdash! First, because even very poor Americans are rather wealthy compared to the rest of the world, with luxuries the lower 50% (or more like 70%) of the world population can only dream of. Second, American capitalism has brought better economic conditions to many parts of the world! (Or do you think the world got richer because of Russian Bolshevism or Chinese Communism?) 5. where the poor would end up in a totally unregulated economy. We do not have a totally unregulated economy. We have a rather highly regulated economy. I worked for years in the insurance &amp; reinsurance industry which is a very highly regulated industry. Next, see 1. above. Here in America the economic bands are fluid. People can start in a lower band and work their way up to a better band. That's why many people from elsewhere, wish to come here! Not everybody needs to be as successful as Bill Gates or George Soros. But many. many immigrants come here, from all parts of the world, and do better for themselves and their families than they could in their home countries. (PS: Why do you think that so many immigrants come here, even illegally?)</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358212421778</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 20:13:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358212895100-114</Id><Topic><Title>ya idgits make me laugh with your talk of the Earths 'true' temperature</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1358208839538</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 19:13:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If the Earth does not have a "true" (e.g. correctly measured) average temperature, how can we tell if it is warming or cooling.

That explains a lot. As a simplistic starting point for you to begin your work from: There are five samples provided: 152.1 lbs, 154.7 lbs, 151.0 lbs, 153.5 lbs, and 152.3 lbs. The arithmetic mean has been computed: 152.72 as rounded to five signifigant digits. The median (the value which splits the difference between the samples, in laymans terms) hasn't been calculated: it's closer to 152.3 than it is to 152.7. Since the mode and the mean aren't separated by more than about 20% of the range (3.7) of the values, we don't have any good reason to think that the distribution of values we might read is significantly different from the "normal". We can also find the variances, first with respect to the mean: 2. And with respect to the median: 2.2 You should be able to find out the signifigance of the caluclated results and how to compute them without too much trouble. As well as the "standard deviation": 1.4 for all intents and purposes. From the above information we can deduce: That we shouldn't be too surprised if the described device outputs a number that spans a range of 9.25 units when the input is identical to the one that resulted in the series of outputs the Chemistry professor has made up. The maximum likely error in the average that was computed (the arithmetic mean) given that the number of samples provided was 5 is 0.7. This means that even though half of the time the value that is likely to be output by the described device will fall within a 2.8 pounds-force range the estimate of the actual value we were trying to measure that we obtained by averaging has a most likely error span of 1.4 pounds-force.

The whole class warfare argument presumes fixed classes. Capitalists versus Labor and all that. Here in America, labor can become capitalists if they work hard. And many do. *** 2 I didn't say median You implied median. Is "the bottom 50%" not the 50% below the median? *** 3.a. All examples drawn from recent history That is the period we are living in, isn't it? We are not living in the 1850's anymore when Marx wrote his theories out. *** 3.b. One employer versus many employers. Sorry if I implied a single employer acting all alone. In a MARKET there are many employers all acting in their own interests. Likewise there are many employees all acting in their own interests. As I pointed out: The Feds passed an increase in the minimum wage that had little effect, since the market rate minimum wage (for all employers) was higher than that. The facts were, if an employer wasn't offering $8 or $9 per hour they would have trouble attracting new employees. These were retail store, entry level jobs. More skilled jobs demanded higher pay. I personally thought the original federal minimum wage of $5.25 was great because it was irrelevant in a market demanding $8 or $9. *** 3.c. Employers have capital and can wait for wages and desperation. What market forces counterbalance this effect. Depends. On one hand you are thinking in terms of big corporations. Think of small businesses (where most jobs are anyway.) They have clients to service. Debts to pay. Bills to pay. Rent or mortgage to pay. They need to do all that now. Not at some vague date in the future. They are committed to providing goods or services to clients and keeping them happy NOW! (If they don't the clients will find some other business that WILL!) They need cash flow NOW! (As in revenue from selling goods and services to customers.) They need labor NOW! (To produce those goods and services.) And at a reasonable rate of pay for the productivity the employee provides. Most businesses are not robber barrons sitting on mountains of hoarded gold. Even big corporations can get into serious financial problems if they don't keep the business operating and customers satisfied, no matter what! Big businesses have stockholders and other stakeholders demanding action, revenue and profits NOW! Yes, it is true that at this very time many companies, big and small, are sitting on cash, at least that is what I hear. But that is not because they are hoarders, or plotting to destroy the employment market. They are reluctant to commit cash and other capital while there is so much political turmoil and unknown conditions in the near future. Regulations, taxes and such all expected to change soon. No one is sure just how. I also hear that some of that cash, for bigger corporations, is from revenue overseas and the companies are reluctant to bring it home to face (new) extra taxation. (It it stays over there, it gets taxed less.) *** 4. The bottom 50% What you are saying is balderdash. First off, being below the median household income (the bottom 50%) does not mean you are desperately poor and living in a cardboard box! There are millions of people just below the 50% mark that lead reasonable lives. They own cars, air conditioners, color TVs etc. Some still own houses. They are not rich but lead reasonable lives. Last time I checked, the Federal Poverty Level, for an individual, was like $10,500 or less per year. This is about half the median income for an individual. (If I recall correctly the median for an individual is around $25,000 per year. May have changed since I looked it up last.) The median income for a household is around $35,000 per year. I guarantee you that there LOTS of Americans living on incomes between the Federal Poverty Level and the median income and they are NOT desperately poor. They are your fellow Americans! (As Abe Lincoln once said, "God must have loved the common man. He made so many of them!") Even those in the bottom 20% are not living in cardboard boxes. And the fact is we ARE living today and DO have "safety nets" in place. Social security. Various welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAPS (food stamps) unemployment checks and so on. American people living in cardboard boxes usually are homeless people with some sort of serious alcohol, drug or mental problems. These are far below the 50% income mark or even the 20% income mark. You are painting with a broad brush and haven't a clue what you are talking about. By the way, one of the PROBLEMS with current poverty programs is that some are made available to households with two times or three times the Federal Poverty Level, which means they ARE being made available to households with median income or higher. (e.g. $10,500 * 3 = $31,500 which is above the median income for an individual.) 5. IDEALLY what we would all prefer is a flourishing economy with lots of business, employment and opportunity for all. PARTING SHOT: Barack Obama's half-brother in Kenya lives in a cardboard bnox as do MILLIONS (maybe BILLIONS) of poor people around the world. Even Barack Obama's aunt wanted to stay in America where poverty is much more comfortable!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358225814914</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-14 23:56:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
