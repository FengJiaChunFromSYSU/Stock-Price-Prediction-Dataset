Furthermore, Fort Knox testing has been delayed by Samsung till June 2013 and that the major Carriers in the US and internationally would need several months of testing that pushes its likely implementation to early to mid 2014 and by then Windows based Phones by Nokia (Lumia 520/521/ Catwalk and Lumia 1000) will be eating Android's lunch and some.

Samsung chose late last year to adopt Windows Azure for SmartTV and here are the announcements by both Samsung and MSFT: "With SmartTV servicing over 120 countries, Samsung chose Windows Azure to build a "solid and reliable infrastructure" for its customers. “After extensive testing, Windows Azure is the cloud offering that met our exacting conditions,” said an official at Samsung Electronics’ Visual Display Business Division. Microsoft followed the announcement with its own statement: “Samsung Electronics’ Smart TV is taking advantage of the unique capabilities of Windows Azure,” said Bob Kelly, corporate vice president of Windows Azure at Microsoft. “Windows Azure gives Samsung the ability to focus on its business rather than having its technical team deal with problem-solving and troubleshooting issues.” THE time is of the essence for Samsung to jump on WP-8 train or risk being taken to the cleaners by Nokia et al.

Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), including cloud compute, storage and print services, continued as the fastest-growing segment of the market, growing 42.4 percent in 2012 to $6.1 billion and expected to grow 47.3 percent in 2013 to $9 billion. "The continued growth of the cloud services market will result from the adoption of cloud services for production systems and workloads, in addition to the development and testing scenarios that have led as the most prominent use case for public cloud services to date," said Ed Anderson, research director at Gartner. "Evidence of this growth is found in the increasing demand for cloud services from end-user organizations, met by an increased supply of cloud services from suppliers." Although there is wide variation between cloud services market subsegments, strong demand is anticipated for all types of cloud services offerings. The cloud business process services segment (BPaaS) is the second-largest market segment after cloud advertising, comprising 28 percent of the total market in 2012, followed by cloud application services (software as a service [SaaS]) at 14.7 percent, cloud system infrastructure services (IaaS) at 5.5 percent, cloud management and security services at 2.8 percent, and cloud application infrastructure services (platform as a service [PaaS]) at one percent.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367765500053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 10:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367765739279-24</Id><Topic><Title>Gartner Says Worldwide Public Cloud Services Market to Total $131 Billion....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367765500053</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 10:51:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cont'd.... "North America is the largest region in the cloud services market, accounting for 59 percent of all new spending on cloud services from 2013 through 2016. Western Europe, despite the growth challenges in the region, remains the second-largest region and will account for 24 percent of all new spending during the same time period. However, the highest growth rates for cloud services continue to come from the emerging regions of Emerging Asia/Pacific (led by Indonesia and India), Greater China and Latin America (led by Argentina, Mexico and Brazil). "IT services providers, particularly those focused on delivering cloud services offerings or related services, must consider these disproportionately large mature markets if they want to play a leading role in cloud services growth worldwide," Mr. Anderson said. "Similarly, markets in Emerging Asia/Pacific, Greater China and Latin America should also be important considerations for IT services providers that want to capitalize on the high growth of these regions, particularly Latin America and Greater China".

I'm actually a white American of European descent. And the way you respond to my posts tells a lot about how your mind works. The use of defective grammar is a tool to find out how people will respond to the thoughts, ideas and declarations of a person who may not be, but in this case really is, a native language speaker. Your responses paint a very clear picture of how you perceive and react to others. You never have a fact based response to anything you disagree with or don't want to hear. Think about what you inability to offer a meaningful defense means. Your racist baiting is being directed at someone who doesn't have the heritage that you want to imagine they do. This is because you are unable to associate a person's underlying humanity with the ideas they present if they don't present them in a way that you, incorrectly, think represents some false ideals of both quality and equality by being expressed in English a certain way. That "string" you speak of is one that binds your thoughts into a false and very small minded perspective on other human beings. And your posts here project pride in your lack of ability to see others as human if they don't match up to your defective guidelines. I would recommend that you think about these points a bit. I hope that you will be able to see yourself better now even if that will be, and appropriately so, a very distasteful perception for you. It is an opportunity for you to discover something about your own nature by seeing how you relate to others. How will you use it?</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367768978327</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 11:49:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367769133021-35</Id><Topic><Title>THE Markets will rally for the rest of 2013 and here is why....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367629076176</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:57:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>glad to see that you have sense of humor about own lack of logic. may be some hope for you yet. please don't dash my hope and prove you are total loss!</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367769133021</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 11:52:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367769266364-36</Id><Topic><Title>Fat Bald Old Farts Still Fighting The Civil War</Title><Username>zernike_polynomials</Username><Timestamp>1367768934078</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 11:48:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What in H does that have to do with MSFT?</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1367769266364</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 11:54:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367769642182-37</Id><Topic><Title>WHY Samsung will migrate to WP-8....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367765108046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 10:45:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so, you still not able to use 'migrate' correctly in sentence. even after some instruction on this. you having humpty dumpty moment here. it mean precisely what you intend it to mean? can spell it correctly though,,,,,,,,,,, what info you have on knox? you leave that out. as usual. now you quote public relation release as if it is scholarly treatise and not pr-speak. you really believe marketing reflect real world? :haha: then you follow up with wish-based propaganda. this impressive. just not in positive way you hope for.</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367769642182</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 12:00:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367769726453-38</Id><Topic><Title>The CAT is out of the BAG - Buying has begun..

Hitcent's Peppers agrees that porting non-cross-platform iOS and Android apps to Windows 8 could "take some time." Even still, the small bumps presented by the Windows 8 SDK pale compared to the hoops developers originally had to jump through to work on mobile applications. "You hear some people complaining about [development] hurdles, but it's nothing compared to the original hurdles face when Apple's Xcode [integrated development environment software] came out," says JamPot CTO James Barr. "That was a big challenge to get people started on iOS." The Windows 8 developers we spoke to don't agree with the wait-and-see approach of the hesitant Android and iOS developers.

I have also been able to get some editing done using the Surface Pro," photographer Chris Burkard stated. Burkard adds that the Surface Pro is not only light, but also compact. The device has also allowed him to do his photo editing while on the road. Burkard also loves the portability that comes with the Surface Pro and ability to use it as a communication tool.

Project Gotham Racing is something that an Xbox platform deserves, especially at launch. Bizarre Creations, who developed these games, were closed and in their place Lucid Games were formed which consisted of ex-Bizarre developers. Earlier there was a rumour floating around which mentioned that the studio was developing Project Gotham Racing 5 for the next gen Xbox, and they also came from a reputable source. It’s still speculation but a recent Facebook comment by Lucid Games has somewhat hinted that the game could be announced on May 21st at the Xbox 720 reveal event. The post reads: “So yeah, Mid-May will be interesting for the studio. We have some exciting updates coming. Stay tuned!” The comment says something about “mid-may”, so it looks like the game is set to be announced soon. They had also earlier teased an image which kind of hints at the game.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367775773380</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 13:42:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367777522400-61</Id><Topic><Title>La Pierre sez</Title><Username>ghosanonon</Username><Timestamp>1367731846613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 01:30:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually you can only pretend to know logic. whether it his or from any other source,,,,,,,,,,,,,,</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367777522400</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 14:12:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367777654686-62</Id><Topic><Title>WHY Samsung will migrate to WP-8....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367765108046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 10:45:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what you think this connected to in discussion so far?</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367777654686</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 14:14:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367777737004-63</Id><Topic><Title>WHY Samsung will migrate to WP-8....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367765108046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 10:45:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pr-speak again. should i post silly stuff like this too? maybe not.</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367777737004</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 14:15:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367777836497-64</Id><Topic><Title>WHY Samsung will migrate to WP-8....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367765108046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 10:45:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you substitute volume for substance. what you think that point to? :haha:</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367777836497</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 14:17:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367778460994-65</Id><Topic><Title>He Wants Background Checks on Guns but Keeps His Own Background Hidden</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1367723813442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 23:16:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You do realize when you blame Bush for the fruits of a law Clinton signed and Barney Frank and Maxine Waters defended abuse of you come off as not only pathetic, but none too smart?

After several rumors surrounding the tech blog about the Nokia Catwalk and EOS, now another rumored device codenamed ‘Nokia Laser’. Sources said that Verizon is planning to unveil a high-end Nokia Lumia phone this year. Based on The Verge, US carrier will offer a device that has similar specifications to Nokia’s current Lumia 920. Dubbed as Nokia Laser, is apparently planned to be launched together with the Nokia Catwalk device. Laser is said to be a variant of the Nokia Lumia 920 for Verizon, so it will likely feature the same polycarbonate body of the 920 instead of the rumoured aluminium body of the Catwalk. Sources have exposed that Microsoft will be backing up the carrier’s launch of this device heavily. Since this will be a high end device, Nokia Laser will be marketed alongside rival top tier devices.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367785256009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 16:20:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367785372092-74</Id><Topic><Title>He Wants Background Checks on Guns but Keeps His Own Background Hidden</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1367723813442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 23:16:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It took many generations of incest to create your father hawpig. jebus only knows what happened to a bald headed pig like you.</Msg><Username>hi_speed_jebus_motors</Username><Timestamp>1367785372092</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 16:22:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367786520390-75</Id><Topic><Title>La Pierre sez</Title><Username>ghosanonon</Username><Timestamp>1367731846613</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 01:30:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No coherent answer from Feeces, as usual.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1367786520390</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 16:42:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367786608085-76</Id><Title>Stock-market rally takes a new turn as tech leads....</Title><Msg>(MarketWatch) — With the U.S. stock market rallying to record highs, investors are starting to buy 2013’s more unloved sectors: technology, materials and energy. If this shift sticks, the move could juice the market even more. The S&amp;P 500 Information Technology Index rose 4.6% last week. The S&amp;P Energy advanced 2.9%. The S&amp;P Materials Index gained 2.4%. This year’s stock market rally has been odd in that investors have piled into defensive-minded sectors such as consumer staples and utilities that pay steady dividends. Normally, when the stock market climbs to record highs, companies that sell basic materials and industrial equipment are out front. This coming week, any chatter about a market correction could take a pause with no important economic data on the calendar along with 80% of S&amp;P 500 corporate earnings in the rear view mirror. Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S&amp;P Capital IQ, said he expects investors to “throw in the towel” on the much-talked about correction. “We aren’t getting that correction now,” Stovall said. “It’s been delayed.” The correction debate could spring back to life in mid-May when fresh U.S. manufacturing data are dispensed, Stovall said.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367786608085</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 16:43:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367786652646-77</Id><Topic><Title>WHY Samsung will migrate to WP-8....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367765108046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 10:45:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you mis-use word migration 3 time now. that not above my head at all. you just offering more evidence that you either not know what word mean or not know how to use it in sentence. it your opinion that samsung have only one option to avoid supposed threat from nokia. that opinion that i ask you to offer support for. instead you just repeat. that not above my head either. you say that you expect this above my head. i believe you really have that expectation. i also expect you do usual thing and contradict self when show to be mistaken and also claim you right before and after contradiction. you do this many time already. that support my expectation. you feel any monkey stirring deep within getting ready to make humorous but uncomfortable exit? because that happen before anything you mention here above my head. :haha:</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367786652646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 16:44:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367786912942-78</Id><Topic><Title>He Wants Background Checks on Guns but Keeps His Own Background Hidden</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1367723813442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 23:16:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>abomination, where are Bush's, Romney's, Palin's, McCain's, Nixon's, Clinton's etc's, birth certificates?

May will be a great month aside from the Macro front as market uptrend will be intact till July 2013 when our earnings will get us to over $50.00 as we will have XBOX 720 launches along with Nokia Lumia 521, Catwalk and Laser this month.... Samsung will come along and adopt WP-8 as they are under great pressure by losing patent fights to AAPL, so 14 of their products will be banned from the US; and as Google will continue losing major Patent battles with AAPL and MSFT amongst others.... WE will also start selling Surface Pro and RT in 25 new major markets in May 2013 and grab more market share in Cloud as we signed up 10,000 new customers alone last month.... ADD to that the acceleration in migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 &amp; 8 (some 500 million plus licenses).... And then comes Surface 7 and Windows Blue to finish the quarter on high note.

As reported by Reuters, the Federal U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday denied Apple's bid to expedite a ban on Samsung products. At issue is a December decision from California district Judge Lucy Koh, who refused to grant Cupertino's request for a ban on infringing Samsung products.
