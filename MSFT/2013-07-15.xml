Way back in time, Windows ME was so bad it was scrapped within less than a year, I recall. Today, Windows 8 is so confusing that they had to issue 8.1 to show users how to operate it. Microsoft software programs are not easy to learn and thus not being "customer friendly" it takes quite some time for one to become proficient in learning how to operate the system and figure out how to live with the hiccups in the defective software offering. I expect this is in large part why many people exited Microsoft and took up with Apple products. I recall I went over to Apple several years ago and it was so self explanatory; on top of that the quality of workmanship of my Macintosh computer was so superior to any PC I had ever owned that I never had to get an updated operating system for several years. Right now I am back on Windows 7 because I am trying it out to see if I may stay on with Microsoft, but I have decided I am going to depart Windows for Apple next year when this computer (PC used) is scheduled to give up the ghost and I can not feel any loss. For those who really understand Microsoft Windows 7 and 8 well, they are the best persons to own it and I suppose they have had many, many years using Windows and fully understand the complex intricacies of the W's operating system. A total novice to computers can figure out Mac operating system (I-pad, I-phone, and computers) with minimal training and experience, and the Mac line offers all of the options and products capabilities that Windows provides. So no wonder Apple is number one market cap company in the world right now. By the way, everyone continues to see the ad the PC is dead, but no one has any worry about seeing such advertisement over the future of the Apple computer operating system.</Msg><Username>woodrocks5125</Username><Timestamp>1373867332619</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 01:48:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373874290734-5</Id><Title>DRAM $4.29 UP 20% LAST WEEK....TARGET $30+…WHY??: 1) NEW MONSTER MEMORY MANUFACTURING DEAL WITH AMD, 2) MEMORY PRICES WAY UP, 3) DIVERSIFICATION</Title><Msg>The two biggest reasons for DRAM’s incredible upside from today’s prices are discussed below. In addition to these recent developments, DRAM will benefit from skyrocketing memory prices (it's main core business for the last several decades). DRAM was already on the verge of profitability even before the 2 factors mentioned above will have a significant positive effect on earnings in the current and future quarters, . The current 0.2 X sales compared to 1.5 sector average is ridiculous and will be corrected soon. DRAM’s current market cap is only $8 million. There only 1.4M tightly held shares on the float. 1) AMD and DRAM announced in May (5/8/2013 AMD Press Release and 5/12/2013 DRAMPress Release) that DRAM will begin manufacturing all new AMD Gamer Series memory modules and will provide it's RAMDisk software to drive all AMD Radeon products. The Gamer Series memory is compatible with AMD and Intel platforms, supporting both AMP and XMP memory profiles. Recent reviews rank AMD Gamer Series memory the fastest and more reliable for gaming and other applications requiring super-fast processing speeds. "AMD Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series Memory is armed with features designed to outperform the competition on any task," said Roman Kyrychynskyi, product director, Graphics Business Unit, AMD. "Designed with multi-platform compatibility in mind, the AMD Radeon RG2133 brings cutting-edge technology, as well as uncompromising quality and compatibility for PC gamers. "AMD and Dataram have worked together to significantly enhance the dynamic background load-and-save feature in order to create a seamless, non-volatile RAMDisk experience," said Jason Caulkins, CTO, Dataram. "This underscores AMD and Dataram's continued dedication to delivering the highest-performing memory products. 2) DRAM is also pursuing it's RAMDisk technology in the energy, banking, simulations, military, medical, and other sectors requiring super-fast processing speeds.</Msg><Username>ntofive</Username><Timestamp>1373874290734</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 03:44:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373884767880-6</Id><Title>Buy an MS Surface tablet. 30% discount this week</Title><Msg>Great opportunity to buy a great MS product.

I asked them for feedback after the seminar (2 days). Most said they feared windows 8.1 coming into the seminar, but now they are more favorable to use it, now that they see how it works and how to get around. The IT people (about 70) of this group said they felt there was still a lot of back end work to be done about metro over server 2012. I did say there are many many more settings on server 2012 to go through but it gives the IT dept more power on mobile devices connecting to the network. This raised some 'ahs' and eyebrows. I think IT are also starting to understand more about it and feel more comfortable around it.</Msg><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1373885623489</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 06:53:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373888698621-9</Id><Title>looks like a drag day.</Title><Msg>a draggin wagon.

"That's because for most of the last decade, the actions that have done the most to harden Perry's anti-Washington {pro-Constitutional states' rights} reputation have really been the work of Abbott. Abbott has sued the Environmental Protection Agency 17 times. He challenged the Department of Health and Human Services four times. He sued then-Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner over section III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, which gives the federal government the power to liquidate big banks. He twice sued US Attorney General Eric Holder over the Department of Justice's rejection of the state's voter ID law and redistricting plans. After the Supreme Court struck down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, Abbott announced that Texas' voter ID law would go into effect immediately. He sued the Department of Education. He sued the Department of the Interior three times. He took the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to court." Election day in November 2014 is going to be a highly enjoyable party, as voters continue to protect Texas, banning Democrats from any of Texas' 27 statewide offices since 1994. And I'm sure we'll strengthen the traditional, mainstream conservative base of the legislature as well by getting rid of a few more of the kooks.</Msg><Username>plmartin2013</Username><Timestamp>1373897296894</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 10:08:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373897451554-16</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama a Shameless Racist</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1373835458311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 16:57:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hawcreek definitely attacks African Americans with bias, even the President, who was raised by white people and had a white mother.

Enterprise sales are hitting a top; look at HP and Dell enterprise hardware sales--not really growing. Virtualization hits a max after awhile, and the need to upgrade hardware has to happen, but not to the degree you would expect.

The time has come where there is some new processors and the current machines are in the discount mode. I do not know when the pro will go on sale. The pro is the best tablet / laptop combo that is out there with the real keyboard cover. That is 129 extra. They will likely throw those in or discount them. Keep an eye on a discount of the Surface Machines. The Surface RT will be a nice extra device when it hits the 200-300 range.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1373916428261</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:27:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373916462181-72</Id><Topic><Title>Broke through the barriers</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1373915984810</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-15 15:19:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes!

If you listen to CNBC enough and and blindly follow their advice you are sure to lose money. Many of the folks on their are hedge fund managers. They do not have your best interests at heart. Just last week the Fast Money crowd was very negative on MSFT. There is a reason that the stock is going up with all the negative press.

You do not listen to many on this board that have pointed out the positives about MSFT. If you think that MSFT is all about the PC then you are mistaken. Here is a quick primer for those that actually want to learn. 1. PC are not dead only in retrenchment from bad economy. Sales are picking up on the corporate side. 2. MSFT is killing it on the Enterprise side. IT is the dominant server technology in the market. SQL, Exchange kick it in the marketplace. Productivity software "Office" dominates. MSFT has made big inroads in the visualization space in the last year. 3. Cloud initiatives like Office 365 are making big inroads. They are gaining market share. 4. MSFT is becoming a player in the mobile space including Tablets and Phones. True they are not a big player yet but they are gaining market share. They will double the amount of phone market share they have in one year. 5. XBOX consoles are getting to be big money for MSFT.
