Computerworld - The decline in usage share of Windows XP, which is slated for retirement in 53 weeks, has slowed significantly, hinting that millions of its users will hold onto the operating system much longer than some, including Microsoft, expect. Data published monthly by California-based Web analytics company Net Applications indicates that XP's long-running slide has virtually stalled since Jan. 1. In the past three months, Windows XP's monthly drop in share has averaged just 0.12 of a percentage point. That's less than a fifth as much as the 12-month average of 0.68 percentage points. ===============================================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1364911519352</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:05:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364911756704-14</Id><Title>nokia and softie are both on the way to the dumps</Title><Msg>another big writeoff coming.its good bye nokia in 2014. wiped off the face of the earth</Msg><Username>alex_sptrader</Username><Timestamp>1364911756704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:09:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364911792852-15</Id><Title>Microsoft Should Not Buy Netflix</Title><Msg>Google it.

What kind of low intellect shoots a beautiful creature for sport? The low intellects among the group from Europe mainly. There is something mentally ill there. to do those things. Oddly they don't get the flak other groups get, even though they have had a terrible history. Could it be they are mainly the flak givers too? Yes. hahaha "if one person does bad things use that as an excuse to take rights away from all." Thanks for describing your party and yourself. Odd how you shoot yourself in your foot frequently.

Environmental groups said the rupture of the Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) pipe on March 29 in Mayflower, Arkansas, shows why Obama should reject Keystone, which would be a major new conduit between the U.S. and Canada for a type of fuel critics say is more corrosive than more conventional forms of oil. “Without question, this underscores the risks of transporting this stuff,” Jim Murphy, senior counsel at the National Wildlife Federation, said yesterday in a phone interview. The U.S. State Department is reviewing TransCanada Corp.’s (TRP) Keystone project to link Alberta’s oil sands with refineries along the Gulf Coast because it crosses an international border. White House press secretary Jay Carney said yesterday the White House takes the safety of the pipeline system “very seriously.” He said the Environmental Protection Agency is working with local officials and Exxon on the Arkansas spill.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1364941698584</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 18:28:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364947118735-74</Id><Topic><Title>Windows XP decline stalls as users hold onto aged OS, flaunt 2014 deadline</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1364911519352</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 10:05:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wally...stop stinking up the planet with your being alive.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1364947118735</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 19:58:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364947235295-75</Id><Topic><Title>Uptake gap between Windows 8 and Vista widens even as new OS gains share</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1364854817872</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 18:20:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bumpity</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1364947235295</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 20:00:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364947669666-76</Id><Title>New 52 week high after this Q earnings report.</Title><Msg>MSFT is really doing great in all the sectors!</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1364947669666</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 20:07:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364948580741-77</Id><Title>Prices of Windows RT tablets drop, point to failure of OS</Title><Msg>Google it....great news....M$ FAIL continues.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1364948580741</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 20:23:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364949001763-78</Id><Title>OUTLOOK BLOWS</Title><Msg>I want my Hotmail back!!!!</Msg><Username>fred_c_dobbs00</Username><Timestamp>1364949001763</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 20:30:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364954187964-79</Id><Topic><Title>Show Me an American Ghetto</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1364917537960</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-02 11:45:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You never learn anything.
