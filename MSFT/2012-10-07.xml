Almost all who watched the contest concluded that there was one president on the stage, and it was Mitt Romney. Obama sympathizers took the measure of the situation and decided that the best thing to do was to hoist the white flag and get out of Dodge. Chris Matthews asked, “Where was Obama tonight?” James Carville observed that it “looked like .  .  . President Obama didn’t want to be there.” A few half-hearted attempts to deflect the result by arguing that Mitt Romney had bullied Jim Lehrer collapsed under the revelation that Barack Obama had held onto the microphone for four minutes longer than his opponent.

Both of The Obamas come across as rude and arrogant. I think The Romneys would make more polite and interesting people to have diner with. From stories I've heard (on Glenn Beck and elsewhere) Mitt Romney has done some extraordinary "good deeds" for friends and business associates. All off camera and never expecting anything in return. Some involved real physical labor that Mitt Romney did personally. Others involved extraordinary personal caring. I think Mitt Romney is a better man on a bad afternoon than Barack Obama is in a good month.</Msg><Username>travisthechimp.alsharpton</Username><Timestamp>1349588962138</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 01:49:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349607076457-16</Id><Title>Any idea which way MSFT will trade next week?</Title><Msg>I was watching some trade videos on TheContrarianTrader blog and found some great videos.

According to knowledgeable sources, a national magazine and a national web site are preparing a blockbuster donor scandal story. Sources told Secrets that the Obama campaign has been trying to block the story. But a key source said it plans to publish the story Friday or, more likely, Monday. According to the sources, a taxpayer watchdog group conducted a nine-month investigation into presidential and congressional fundraising and has uncovered thousands of cases of credit card solicitations and donations to Obama and Capitol Hill, allegedly from unsecure accounts, and many from overseas. That might be a violation of federal election laws. The Obama campaign has received hundreds of millions in small dollar donations, many via credit card donations through their website. On Thursday, the campaign announced a record September donor haul of $150 million. At the end of the 2008 presidential campaign, the Obama-Biden effort was hit with a similar scandal. At the time, the Washington Post reported that the Obama campaign let donors use "largely untraceable prepaid credit cards that could potentially be used to evade limits on how much an individual is legally allowed to give or to mask a contributor's identity."</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1349634771113</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 14:32:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349634933112-45</Id><Topic><Title>UNEMPLOYMENT FALLS TO 7.8%</Title><Username>mendelcarmen</Username><Timestamp>1349631363578</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 13:36:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shooting an unarmed old man is all you got?

He will return to doing campaign events on Thursday, when he will debate Rep. Paul Ryan in the vice presidential debate. Biden Obama 3b edit1 On Friday, October 5, according to the White House, Biden spent the day working. In the morning, he was scheduled to attend the presidential daily briefing in the Oval Office, with President Obama. That afternoon Biden was to "meet with senior advisors," according to the White House. For this weekend, the White House provided the following guidance: "The Vice President will be in Wilmington, Delaware. There are no public events scheduled." As for the next three days, Biden will remain in Delaware. "On Monday through Wednesday, the Vice President will be in Wilmington, Delaware. There are no public events scheduled." Meanwhile, Thursday, October 11, is a big day for Biden. "On Thursday, the Vice President and Dr. Jill Biden will travel to Danville, Kentucky. In the evening, the Vice President will participate in the Vice Presidential Debate at Centre College. Dr. Biden will also attend. This event is open to pre-credentialed media." So while Biden is taking 6 days off the campaign trail at a crucial time in the presidential campaign, it's likely that he isn't completely off. He is said to be spending time with David Axelrod and other campaign advisers preparing for Thursday's debate.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349653276344</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 19:41:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349653436617-63</Id><Topic><Title>Big Bird and the Chinese</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1349652789073</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 19:33:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While your kids are watching big bird, the Chinese kids are eating your kid's lunch fool.</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349653436617</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 19:43:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349653476933-64</Id><Topic><Title>Big Bird and the Chinese</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1349652789073</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 19:33:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you really possibly think that Republicans think education is a bad thing?
