Months!!! There are still folks crying for help!" SO TRUE!!! Also --- Katrina was CAT 5 !! It went directly on top of a major city and the entire city of over a million was flooded. That was huge. states like Texas kindly reached out and let hundreds of thousands stay in their cities. The suffereing was inevietable and was only worse because Mayor Nagin and gov Blanco screwed up and made FEMA (and BUsh) the fall guy for their mistakes. ... Like if you saw the thousand school buses flooded right by the superdome... DOH! that was the evac plan right there - NOT DONE - because the stupid mayor did nothing when the crisis hit. DEMOCRATS ARE ALWAYS BETTER AT THE BLAME GAME THAN DOING ANY GOOD. Sandy was CAT 1 ... it was a nothing storm in comparison and people got flooded and lost power because of stupid NYC decisions mainly and not because it was a huge storm. Its like comparing a paper cut and a leg amputation ... and what did Obama do? a photo op and then SPEND TAXPAYERS MONEY. They barred non-union folks so millions is wasted and work is delayed. how dumb is that? Union power. A liberal newsrag saying Obama handled his paper cut better than Bush handled a leg amputation botched by Democrats in La is laughable in the extreme. BTW For once I want the TAXPAYERS thanked not these stupid liberals praising a lying cheating spendthrift marxist president for stealing the credit from the real heroes.</Msg><Username>buy_it_back_lower</Username><Timestamp>1359090282439</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 00:04:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359093210309-2</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT in a Death cross chart...</Title><Username>dimebag_eddie</Username><Timestamp>1359087733107</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-24 23:22:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You may be right.

The company came in AHEAD of the company's guidance but missed Zach's revenue guidance by about 10 minutes worth of sales and you sold? Who the hell is Zach and why should his inflated guidance cause 50 billion dollars worth of market share to go away over 10 MINUTES worth of revenues? Revenues are MASSIVELY ahead of where they were a year ago, margins were AHEAD of where analysts thought they would be, profits were ABOVE estimates, but you panicked and sold? This sell-off was one of the greatest hype jobs in history. The company is still growing so fast it's crazy and investors were told not to focus on that but look for immaterial fringe hype items to focus on instead. See you at 1000 - only I will be holding the shares that you bailed out of - and twice as many now that they are on sale.</Msg><Username>questioner775</Username><Timestamp>1359123821690</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:23:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359124344564-20</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Challenges Google's Practices in Europe</Title><Username>tamekaankromfozuxeo834</Username><Timestamp>1301842690000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-04-03 10:58:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One more thing luke.</Msg><Username>oscarsmith177</Username><Timestamp>1359124344564</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 09:32:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359124894153-21</Id><Title>SCREAMING BUY AND HOLD</Title><Msg>This is the year for MSFT.

(1) Congressional Districts are each about the same size. Right now each has about 712000 people. 310 million people / 435 House members =~ 712000. The whole point of the House of Reps is that each Congressman represents a more or less equal number of people. (2) Electoral College is slightly different since number of Electors per state = Number of Senators + Number of House Members. Number of Senators = 2 for every state. (3) The "Winner Take All" system for the Electoral College has been traditional in the USA but it is not required by US Constitution. There are two states already that apportion the Electors by popular vote in each election district. I think Maine and maybe Nebraska. (Or North Dakota? Some state in the midwest.) (4) If all the states adopted an apportionment approach, the Electoral College vote would more closely track the popular vote. Barack Obama would still have won in 2012. (5) Some people argue that an apportionment system would compel candidates to campaign across every election district. There is currently little point for a Republican to campaign in upstate NY, even though there are a lot of Republicans there. NY will always vote Democrat because of NYC &amp; other urban voters. Some say this would gi ve NY Republicans more say in the Presidential election. A similar, reverse case, can be made for Democrats in Texas. (6) The intent of the Electoral College was that each State was sovereign in the Republic and thus voting for President was by State and not by popular vote.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1359135357324</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 12:35:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359135366719-70</Id><Title>Why does MSFT sell at discount?</Title><Msg>They make $billions each year.

Back then the ratio of House members to population was 1 in about 211,000. Over the last century, every American has been more and more disenfranchised by the fact that the ratio is now 1 in about 711,000. Thus our representation in the House is only 29.7% what it was in 1911. If we had the same representation today we would have more like 1469 members in the House of Representatives. Which would favor much more local representation. (8) This would impact the Presidential Election since the Electors in the Electoral College is the number of Senators plus the number of House members. If we ALSO adopted a proportional voting system, results in the Electoral College would much more closely track the popular vote. And presidential campaign tactics &amp; strategy would change drastically! Each candidate would have to campaign all across the nation. Every election district might be a "battle ground district!" Just think: Al Gore might have won in 2000!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1359135917118</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 12:45:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359136271152-72</Id><Topic><Title>GOP WILL TRY TO CHANGE THE ELECTORIAL RULES</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1359132979453</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:56:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually, if mostly Republican states adopted a proportional voting rule it would weaken their chances of winning the Presidential election. Democrat States like NY would NOT adopt the rule, since they could expect to loose Electoral votes from the upstate Republican districts (that are currently disenfranchised by down-state Democrats.) Meanwhile, in the Republican states that adopted proportional voting, Republicans would lose some Electoral votes to Democrats. Results: Guaranteed Republican lose, every time.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1359136271152</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 12:51:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359136787175-73</Id><Title>Watch for the 2:45 sell off</Title><Msg>Just saying I wouldn't get to comfortable.</Msg><Username>creephhi</Username><Timestamp>1359136787175</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 12:59:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359137841233-74</Id><Topic><Title>America Fights Back and Wins!</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1359132135320</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:42:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The appointments to the federal agency were made illegally because the nominees would never have made it past the mainstream of the Senate, and the administration needed them in place quickly in order to keep the three-member quorum required to issue its Leninist dictates and regulations."

Over the decades, presidents of both parties have used them for political and practical purposes. Since May 2011, Republicans have been using a little-known procedure to keep the chamber in session, even when it was not really conducting any business– in order to stop the president from making recess appointments. The legal basis comes from a 1993 Department of Justice brief saying the President should act only if the Senate is in official recess more than three days. So, party leaders have arranged for a single Republican lawmakers to show up every three days and gavel the Senate to order, wait around for a while, gavel it to a close, then leave.

Now, the Rethugs want to change the Electorial College rules by allowing one E.C. vote per District. Most rural districts are close elections where the Rethugs win by a small majority.

We went over this earlier! If Electors in Electoral College were assigned based on proportional voting by district, rather than winner take all, then Barack Obama would probably still still have won because he got more votes. He got about 2% more votes than Romney. He won a landslide in the Electoral College because of the winner take all policy used in most states to choose Electors. Republicans should be careful what they do: in 2000, Bush won because of the winner take all policy. The popular vote was very close. Gore had a marginal win of the popular vote, but Bush won in the Electoral College. That's why there was weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth among the Democrats. If proportional voting was used, then the Electoral College vote would more closly follow the popular vote. There could not be 1 elector for each election district because there are TWO EXTRA electors in each state (one for each senator.) But the selected Electors could be assigned proportionally. Maine &amp; Nebraska already do that.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1359159093051</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 19:11:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359159527806-119</Id><Topic><Title>Minority Of Rightwingers Will Rule In This Country Through Gerrymandering And Electorial Rule Changes</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1359143606882</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 14:53:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you want to do away with the gerrymandering problem, then increase the number of Representatives to reflect the changes in population since maybe 1911 when the magic number of 435 House members was first decided. We would have more like 1469 House members and courts could insist that each election district be reasonably geometrical (rectangular, except maybe for river boundaries &amp; island boundaries.) Each election district coulld be assembled of contigious census tracks, which are roughly rectangular. The result would be more districts, more Representatives, and more representation in congress. Here is what I said before: *** (7) A more interesting fact is that Congress set the total number of House Members at 435 back in 1911 when our population was less than a third what it is now. Back then the ratio of House members to population was 1 in about 211,000. Over the last century, every American has been more and more disenfranchised by the fact that the ratio is now 1 in about 711,000. Thus our representation in the House is only 29.7% what it was in 1911. If we had the same representation today we would have more like 1469 members in the House of Representatives. Which would favor much more local representation. (8) This would impact the Presidential Election since the Electors in the Electoral College is the number of Senators plus the number of House members. If we ALSO adopted a proportional voting system, results in the Electoral College would much more closely track the popular vote. And presidential campaign tactics &amp; strategy would change drastically! Each candidate would have to campaign all across the nation. Every election district might be a "battle ground district!" Just think: Al Gore might have won in 2000! PS: Note that election districts would be about 1/3rd their current size and gerrymandering would be less a problem.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1359159527806</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 19:18:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359159864302-120</Id><Topic><Title>GOP WILL TRY TO CHANGE THE ELECTORIAL RULES</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1359132979453</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 11:56:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Winner Take All system in the Republican primaruies for 2008 and 2012 assured us of McCain then Romney as the Republican candidate.
