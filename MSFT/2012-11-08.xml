The word may no be in Obama's lexicon." HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!! That's so funny I almost sprayed my iMac with coffee. We learned all about the GOP's attitude toward "compromise" listening to Mitch McConnell's constant declaration that the GOP's primary and most important goal was to unseat Obama. We learned all about the GOP's attitude toward "compromise" watching an obstructionist Republican controlled congress refuse to consider any plan to increase revenues to pay for the legitimate functions of government if it meant taking one more penny from those that could most easily afford it, even those entities that are the most abusive when it comes to hiding assets offshore and exploiting every possible loophole in the tax code to keep from paying their fair share. An obstructionist Republican controlled congress blocked every POTUS initiative from 2010 to the present and fought tooth and nail against everything prior to that from 2008 going forward. You can sit around in your underwear in mom's basement sucking on your sour grapes and rewriting history to suit your pitiful fantasies but some things are rooted solidly in a reality that you refuse to acknowledge or accept. Obama won reelection. You lost and your political philosophy has been thoroughly repudiated by a majority of voters and the electoral college that represents them. He will be in office for another four years. He will appoint the next Supreme Court justices. He will continue to shape the future of America in ways that you hate but which will benefit the majority of our citizens, many of which you would disenfranchise and cast by the wayside. I could continue this list for the rest of the day.

Whine whine whine, bash bash bash... I didn't express an OPINION regarding specifically who could or could not afford anything. I merely look at the state of the economy before and after the Bush tax cuts and realize, as should be intuitively obvious to the most casual observer, that things were better and the middle class more prosperous at the end of the Clinton era than they were when GWB left office. I should know. I AM middle class with an annual income between 40k and 50k plus what I make on the side repairing computers in my home shop. My effective disposable income and consequently my standard of living began to deteriorate shortly after GWB took office and declined steadily throughout his presidency. It has only begun to improve since Mr. Obama took office and continues to do so. I'll fight for that and the benefits accrued to my family. So, while you're busy pretending to have a clue about me or my opinion the following remains true. Obama won reelection. You lost and your political philosophy has been thoroughly repudiated by a majority of voters and the electoral college that represents them. He will be in office for another four years. He will appoint the next Supreme Court justices. He will continue to shape the future of America in ways that you hate but which will benefit the majority of our citizens, many of which you would disenfranchise and cast by the wayside.

REUTERS: Chart of the day: U.S. taxes By Felix Salmon December 6, 2010 This chart should be ingrained in the mind of anybody who cares about fiscal policy. The main things to note: Federal taxes are the lowest in 60 years, which gives you a pretty good idea of why America’s long-term debt ratios are a big problem. If the taxes reverted to somewhere near their historical mean, the problem would be solved at a stroke. Income taxes, in particular, both personal and corporate, are low and falling. That trend is not sustainable. Employment taxes, by contrast—the regressive bit of the fiscal structure—are bearing a large and increasing share of the brunt. Any time that somebody starts complaining about how the poor don’t pay income tax, point them to this chart. Income taxes are just one part of the pie, and everybody with a job pays employment taxes. There aren’t any wealth taxes, but the closest thing we’ve got—estate and gift taxes—have shrunk to zero, after contributing a non-negligible amount to the public fisc in earlier decades.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1352416275994</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 18:11:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352418168496-92</Id><Title>East coast is in state of chaos.

According to national security laws on the federal books, doctors can be forced to unretire and be mandatory for them to continue working (for the good of the nation).....check out executive orders dating back prior to Nixon. Drs. can #$%$ all they want. Here is another thought: did they become doctors to make money or help people?</Msg><Username>m.swanger</Username><Timestamp>1352426450388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 21:00:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352427698894-104</Id><Topic><Title>83 % of doctors plan on retiring because of Obamacare</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1352422060303</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 19:47:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1352427698894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 21:21:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352427855673-105</Id><Topic><Title>The real reason Obama Won</Title><Username>pagan942</Username><Timestamp>1352408323058</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 15:58:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama will be the last Black president for a very long time" He's half white, he won't be the last white president, or black, or any other. He is an American President elected by Americans for whatever reason they choose when they mark the ballot. No one's business how I vote or why. The election is over the people have chosen, why does the right keep yelling? So glad he got the popular and the electoral.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1352427855673</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 21:24:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352429661602-106</Id><Title>The Real Reason Romney Lost</Title><Msg>Romney alienated Hispanics especially during the primaries. Romney was sucking off the far right by pretending he was 'severely conservative'. Hispanics took notice of the "self-deportation" remark. Hispanics now make up a much larger percentage of the electorate. They rejected Romney due to his remarks and Romney lost. But the nail in the coffin was the "jeep is moving to China" lie. It was a bald faced lie reputiated by the CEO of FIAT-Chrysler. Workers called the Jeep Plant in Ohio fearing for their jobs. When they found the truth they were PO'ed. That poisoned the waters for Romney in Ohio. In both cases Romney was hung by his own petard, poetic justice if there ever was such a thing.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1352429661602</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 21:54:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352429925219-107</Id><Topic><Title>Tax hike for wealthy Americans won't kill growth: CBO</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1352425809726</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 20:50:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your opinion is worthless since all you've done is post on this message board for over a decade.

Surprised to hear you say that. Even if he did embellish himself and dramatize a few things, I am sure the whole "Frank" mentor thing is quite accurate. You do know about Frank the avowed communist, right? And his mother's thoughts on business and capitalism? Why she left Soertero, Barry's step-dad? If not, read up a bit. His influences go way back beyond his mysterious college daze.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1352435255671</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 23:27:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352436858807-110</Id><Topic><Title>Remember Obama seeking out the 'Marxist professors' (his own words) for political dialog?</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1352424715754</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 20:31:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No. you never change do you. who cares what words you have picked out to dscuss, more importantly is why?
