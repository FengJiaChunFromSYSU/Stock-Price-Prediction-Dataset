Quoting: "For decades, PC makers had little choice but to succumb to the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) hegemony known as Wintel. The software giant and chip maker both rose to ubiquity together, enjoying the most valuable roles in the segmented PC value chain. The vast majority of computers ran Windows and were powered by Intel processors during the rise of the PC. "However, one PC maker has had enough: Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) . "HP has been in turmoil for years. Mark Hurd's controversial ouster in 2011 also came at a time when the broader computing industry was at an inflection point. Apple had launched the iPad just a year prior, jump-starting the tablet renaissance. Leo Apotheker's reign didn't last long, and current CEO Meg Whitman's turnaround is starting to take shape. "That turnaround is very much hinged on a broader approach than HP has historically implemented, one that acknowledges the shift away from Microsoft and Intel in favor of iOS, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) Android, and ARM-based chips. On the last earnings conference call, Whitman made it clear that HP is intent on "using multiple operating systems, multiple architectures, and multiple form factors" going forward. "Whereas once HP's PC portfolio were all Windows PCs with Intel inside, HP has now broadened its horizons and is embracing Google's vision of the future. HP released its first Chromebook earlier this year, followed almost immediately by a Slate 7 Android tablet reminiscent of Google's Nexus 7. The Android-powered SlateBook x2 convertible was just announced, which sports an NVIDIA Tegra 4 processor. Google is uprooting many of Microsoft's core businesses, and HP wants in." ____________________________________________________ The handwriting is on the wall, folks...</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1370850069442</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 03:41:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370851092972-13</Id><Topic><Title>Hewlett-Packard Is Sick of Wintel</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1370850069442</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 03:41:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft is losing customers, now they're losing manufacturer's support too.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1370851092972</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 03:58:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370851158690-14</Id><Topic><Title>penguinx64 SUCKS</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1370773342352</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 06:22:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>father_zosima sucks donkee balz</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1370851158690</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 03:59:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370851222108-15</Id><Topic><Title>KILL THE 'APPS' DEBATE</Title><Username>thermonuke</Username><Timestamp>1367945107449</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:45:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Browser is the OS!</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1370851222108</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 04:00:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370851285455-16</Id><Topic><Title>Chromebook boots faster than a Windows PC</Title><Username>papa.weelee</Username><Timestamp>1370834774416</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-09 23:26:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If your brains were dynamite, you couldn't even blow your nose.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1370851285455</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 04:01:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370851486730-17</Id><Topic><Title>MY NEW WIN. 8 WITH IE 10.

Four years into the upswing, the economy isn’t seeing many of the excesses that often presage the start of contractions. Inflation is slowing, not quickening. Household debt is shrinking, not expanding. The labor market is slack, not tight. Pent-up demand also bodes well for the longevity of the recovery, which has averaged annual growth of about 2 percent since its start in June 2009. Confronted by elevated unemployment and a depressed housing market, Americans put off forming families, buying homes and acquiring cars. Now, with house prices rising and payrolls expanding more rapidly, their behavior is changing. “The current expansion can continue another four to five years,” said Robert Gordon, a professor at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

WHOLEHEATEDLY !</Title><Msg>This week, all three of my kids are graduating high school (no, they’re not triplets. But close. Two are twins. The other is only eleven months older). It’s a bittersweet and exciting time for our entire family. We’ll miss them when they all leave for their respective colleges in August. But then again we’ll be coming home to a clean house. So there is an upside. At least until Thanksgiving break. As a graduation gift from a combined group of people in our family, each kid was given enough money to help subsidize the purchase of a college computer this summer. And so I asked each one of them: what will you buy: a MacBook or an iPad? The answer was unanimous. What do you think it was? I know you’re very excited for the answer, but before I reveal that, I need to first make note of Apple AAPL +1.07%. All three of my kids, like most of their generation, have grown up on Apple products. In fact, two of them (the twins) were given free MacBooks to use for their entire four years of high school, a program initiated by our local school district. My older child, who attended a private school, bought his own. This is the next generation. In just four years those completing high school this month will (hopefully) be entering the workforce or going to graduate school. This is a generation that will be demanding Apple products. They will expect their technology to be as user friendly, fast, and reliable as their MacBooks, iPads and iPhones are today. They will not be accustomed to Windows. They will not tolerate poor quality. Then again, by the time they hit their stride it may not matter much anyway as most of what they’ll be doing will be on the cloud. But companies must be prepared for this reality. If this trend continues and, subject to lots of other unforeseen factors, it appears obvious to me that Apple’s share in office technology is poised to significantly grow over the next decade if only to accommodate the expectations of the next generation of workers who are now and will soon be arriving. So without question my kids all plan to use their graduation cash for an Apple product. Getting a Windows 8 computer never even entered into the conversation. In fact, they tell me that arriving at their new university with a Windows 8 device would raise eyebrows among their fellow incoming freshman. “Why would you buy that?” they would likely be asked, according to my daughter. Maybe she’s right. Maybe not. But the very fact that this would be a concern for an 18 year old should also be a concern for Microsoft MSFT -0.32%. Enough about that. Let’s assume that, for a college student, it’s an Apple world. Which brings me back to the original question: assuming you could afford both, which one do you take with you to college? A MacBook? Or an iPad? It’s the same question that’s being asked now by millions of employers and employees around the world. Do I ditch the laptop? Do I get a tablet? The answer is important, particularly for those that manufacture these computers. And if you manufacture laptops, particularly MacBooks, you can breathe a sigh of relief. All three of my kids, without fail, plan to purchase new MacBooks. They might not be able to afford the higher end MacBook Air. They’ll definitely take advantage of the discounts offered by their colleges. They may even consider something used. But they are buying MacBooks. Not iPads. And the reasons are obvious. Laptops, like the MacBook, are work devices. They are used to do essays, write papers, surf the web, perform analysis and submit assignments. And it doesn’t matter what your specialty is. All three of my kids are taking history, math and science classes and I’m predicting that they all will wind up focusing on either business or science. Whatever the curriculum, they will need a computing device that’s a work device. Sure, they’ll want it to provide entertainment too, access to Facebook FB +3.86%, an option to send the occasional tweet, the ability to watch movies and stream music. But first and foremost they’ll need a computer. And a tablet is not a computer. It’s a recreation device. It can be used to type out the odd email or quick status update. But take a look around you. People are using their iPads for reading books, perusing magazines, watching videos, surfing social media. Future employees, particularly those that need to be filling out forms like purchase requisitions, time sheets and workorders will be using their iPads and other tablets as data input devices. But those that will be writing reports, creating spreadsheets, responding to multiple emails and designing new products will need a work device, not a recreation device. And that will always be a laptop, not a tablet.</Msg><Username>msft_victim</Username><Timestamp>1370873211705</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 10:06:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370873265943-63</Id><Topic><Title>Edward Snowden hero or traitor</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1370871272245</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 09:34:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Something is fishy about it..."

It's no longer far-fetched. It has become evident that all of this - the assault on America's employers, traditions, individual rights, and Constitution - is on purpose, with a specific end game. It is being accomplished because the kooks know that the nice guys fight by trying to uphold principle, ethics, and the rule of law, and only fight back by expressing outrage when these American underpinnings are breached by the brazen leftists. You can't win that way - and the kooks know it all too well. All of the tactics being used by this leftist regime and the state-fellating leftkooks that put them in power, point to one conclusion: a coup, slowly ratcheting up an edgy push, a gradual encroaching tyranny until the restrictive Constitution finally collapses completely and is replaced. This is followed by a plan for a utopia of equality and abundance, free from violence or strife, managed, of course, by the "smart" people who can now more easily find and squash any dissent by those crazies decrying the new absence of "freedom, liberty, and the rights of the individual".</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1370877220133</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:13:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370877737150-84</Id><Topic><Title>Bloomberg: David Koch’s Chilling Effect on Public Television</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1370874331852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 10:25:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Koch Money is polluting the Republican House and now Public Television.</Msg><Username>rightwing_fukery_hurts_usa</Username><Timestamp>1370877737150</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:22:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370877826805-85</Id><Title>Very bad day for MSFT</Title><Msg>But $75 by July 4th still holds.

Kooks like these eventually lose all of the worthwhile friends they have. The profanity and darkness begin to manifest because of a deepening need to feel self-importance and worth when they have little. Kind of like many of the millions of Americans who have been out of work for 4 years now. They have been devastated by the intentional Dark ObamAges, and lash out at family and friends as they languish in their own inability to provide. This poor kook is the one that ends up living in a cabin in the mountains, writing leftist manifestos and sending "presents" to all of the people that messed up their life.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1370878934783</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:42:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370879066149-91</Id><Title>Xbox ONe will be on every news station Tomorrow!!!</Title><Msg>Rally of a life time begins tomorrow!!!

But close. Two are twins. The other is only eleven months older). It’s a bittersweet and exciting time for our entire family. We’ll miss them when they all leave for their respective colleges in August. But then again we’ll be coming home to a clean house. So there is an upside. At least until Thanksgiving break. As a graduation gift from a combined group of people in our family, each kid was given enough money to help subsidize the purchase of a college computer this summer. And so I asked each one of them: what will you buy: a MacBook or an iPad? The answer was unanimous. What do you think it was? I know you’re very excited for the answer, but before I reveal that, I need to first make note of Apple AAPL +1.07%. All three of my kids, like most of their generation, have grown up on Apple products. In fact, two of them (the twins) were given free MacBooks to use for their entire four years of high school, a program initiated by our local school district. My older child, who attended a private school, bought his own. This is the next generation. In just four years those completing high school this month will (hopefully) be entering the workforce or going to graduate school. This is a generation that will be demanding Apple products. They will expect their technology to be as user friendly, fast, and reliable as their MacBooks, iPads and iPhones are today. They will not be accustomed to Windows. They will not tolerate poor quality. Then again, by the time they hit their stride it may not matter much anyway as most of what they’ll be doing will be on the cloud. But companies must be prepared for this reality. If this trend continues and, subject to lots of other unforeseen factors, it appears obvious to me that Apple’s share in office technology is poised to significantly grow over the next decade if only to accommodate the expectations of the next generation of workers who are now and will soon be arriving. So without question my kids all plan to use their graduation cash for an Apple product. Getting a Windows 8 computer never even entered into the conversation. In fact, they tell me that arriving at their new university with a Windows 8 device would raise eyebrows among their fellow incoming freshman. “Why would you buy that?” they would likely be asked, according to my daughter. Maybe she’s right. Maybe not. But the very fact that this would be a concern for an 18 year old should also be a concern for Microsoft MSFT -0.32%. Enough about that. Let’s assume that, for a college student, it’s an Apple world. Which brings me back to the original question: assuming you could afford both, which one do you take with you to college? A MacBook? Or an iPad? It’s the same question that’s being asked now by millions of employers and employees around the world. Do I ditch the laptop? Do I get a tablet? The answer is important, particularly for those that manufacture these computers. And if you manufacture laptops, particularly MacBooks, you can breathe a sigh of relief. All three of my kids, without fail, plan to purchase new MacBooks. They might not be able to afford the higher end MacBook Air. They’ll definitely take advantage of the discounts offered by their colleges. They may even consider something used. But they are buying MacBooks. Not iPads. And the reasons are obvious. Laptops, like the MacBook, are work devices. They are used to do essays, write papers, surf the web, perform analysis and submit assignments. And it doesn’t matter what your specialty is. All three of my kids are taking history, math and science classes and I’m predicting that they all will wind up focusing on either business or science. Whatever the curriculum, they will need a computing device that’s a work device. Sure, they’ll want it to provide entertainment too, access to Facebook FB +3.86%, an option to send the occasional tweet, the ability to watch movies and stream music. But first and foremost they’ll need a computer. And a tablet is not a computer. It’s a recreation device. It can be used to type out the odd email or quick status update. But take a look around you. People are using their iPads for reading books, perusing magazines, watching videos, surfing social media. Future employees, particularly those that need to be filling out forms like purchase requisitions, time sheets and workorders will be using their iPads and other tablets as data input devices. But those that will be writing reports, creating spreadsheets, responding to multiple emails and designing new products will need a work device, not a recreation device. And that will always be a laptop, not a tablet.</Msg><Username>micro_delivery</Username><Timestamp>1370879975731</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 11:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370880739190-99</Id><Topic><Title>A FRESH ARTICLE FROM FORBES.......MY NEICE THE COLLEGE STUDENT AGREES.

AGAIN...</Title><Msg>Apple is expected to reveal a digital radio service and changes to the software behind iPhones and iPads during a keynote presentation Monday at the company's annual conference for software developers in San Francisco. Apple is expected to show off a simplified look on iPhones and iPads. It would be the most radical design change since the iPhone made its debut in 2007. While design modifications could help Apple distinguish its devices from rival phones and tablets, they risk alienating longtime users. For instance, Apple riled users of its gadgets last fall when it kicked out a beloved app using Google's mapping service and replaced it with its own Maps app. What was supposed to be a triumph for Apple served to underscore Google's strength in maps. Apple may use an expected software update this fall, iOS 7, as an opportunity to update its Maps app. Other features in iOS 7 may include new ways to do things through gesture commands. Apple is also expected to debut a streaming music service dubbed iRadio. The keynote kicked off at about 10 a.m. PDT. Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference goes through Friday. Here's a running account of the event, presented in reverse chronological order. All times are PDT. Presenters include CEO Tim Cook and Craig Federighi, senior vice president for software engineering. ___ 10:30 a.m. Apple has had a practice of naming Mac operating system updates after cats. But Federighi worries that the company is running out of names. After joking that Apple will call the next one Sea Lion, Federighi says the next will actually be called Mavericks, a reference to a big wave area in the San Francisco area. The new operating system will support tagging to help you find files more easily. Simply assign one or more tags such as "important" or "movies" to a particular document as you save it. Mavericks will also work with multiple monitors, with docks and menus going across the various display screens. TVs connected via Apple's AirPlay can serve as one of those displays.</Msg><Username>eight_suckz</Username><Timestamp>1370886728321</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 13:52:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370886754677-125</Id><Title>What a let down, none of the games has Kinect capabilities</Title><Msg>OMG, what is this Kinect for then?

No past girl friends popping up anywhere? American citizens, who know every little tidbit about every other president (and their wives) that even know that Andrew Jackson's wife smoked a corn cob pipe and was accused of adultery, or that Lincoln never went to school or Kennedy wore a back brace, or Truman played the piano. We are Americans! Our media vets these things out! We are known for our humanitarian interests and caring for our 'fellow man.' We care, but none of us know one single humanizing fact about the history of our own president. Does this make any of you wonder? Ever wonder why no one ever came forward from Obama's past, saying they knew him, attended school with him, was his friend, etc? Not one person has ever come forward from his past. George Stephanopoulos, ABC News said the same thing during the 2008 campaign. Even George questions why no one has acknowledged that the president was in their classroom or ate in the same cafeteria or made impromptu speeches on campus. Stephanopoulos was a classmate of Obama at Columbia-class of 1984. He says he never had a single class with him. Since he is such a great orator, why doesn't anyone in Obama's college class remember him? And, why won't he allow Columbia to release his records? Do you like millions of others, simply assume all this is explainable - even though no one can?</Msg><Username>doely_1</Username><Timestamp>1370891305198</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 15:08:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370891791559-143</Id><Topic><Title>What happened to the birther movement?</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1370887241592</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 14:00:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When did you realize this.

Quoting: "With little fanfare, Google has added its cool new conversational search feature to Chrome on desktops, following a demonstration last week at Google I/O. "Conversational search is a major upgrade from Google’s previous voice search feature, which merely dictated a search string. You can access it by clicking the microphone icon within the search box of the Google home page and asking a question in plain English (no more tweaking your search strings for a better result). Once Google’s search is complete, you’ll either get a list of results as usual, or get a single card at the top of the screen as well as a pleasant voice answering your query. "The best part of the new search is its awareness of context. Once you start a search, you can continue to have a conversation with Google to refine it.

"And that’s exactly what Google hoped would happen. At the I/O conference earlier this month, Google SVP Amit Singhal said that he hoped that the new offering would lead to the “end of search as we know it.” Google compared it to the voice-activated computer on “Star Trek”—a futuristic type of artificial intelligence that goes beyond just providing links to providing answers. Search has always been the company’s bread-and-butter, and this latest offering shows that the company is thinking deeply about the way we search in an era of new digital devices that know more about us than ever before. "In contrast, Apple’s Siri always felt like something of a nice bonus for new iPhone users, rather than something that was truly integrated into the Apple ecosystem. Apple doing search felt like Google doing social – it was something the company had to do for business competitive reasons, but was never something that came naturally. Siri never cared when you were downloading songs from iTunes and had no idea which books or magazines you were reading on your iPad. Unless you needed a wake-up alarm the next morning, there was no reason to make Siri part of your everyday iPhone or iPad experience. "Google’s new conversational search may be just the warm-up, a sign of more to come."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1370900614762</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 17:43:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370901044774-176</Id><Topic><Title>Attention Special Defenders of President Obama</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1370898032815</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 17:00:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Defenders, with the recent exposure of abortionist Gosnell's house of horrors, we've got to keep up the denials of President Obama's votes for infanticide when he was in the Illionois Senate.

On the other hand, no one saw Romney's bc and no one asked. Why not? George Romney was born in Mexico. There was no doctoring. What would a person doctor on their own birth certificate, for what? Go to fact check, born in the USA and see the facts. They have all the pictures of the BC you claim you saw, they touched it and looked at it. They show the number you say was blacked out. The number was blacked out on the one you saw on your PC screen for privacy or maybe was done by faux to make up a story, who cares. You have been debunked on this before. You are wrong, but you will never say "I am wrong." Go look it up and you will see your mistake. You still will never say "I am wrong", or "Obama was born in a hospital in the USA."

It has worked well, as not one attack on Obama has been sucessful here, all have been debunked. Obama Green Berets would be a better decription of "us." They can record my phone numbers as much as they need, and it hasn't been a problem for me since they started it years ago. Others not in charge of protecting me have much more information. It has been shown at least one major terrorist attack was stopped by the phone data program.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1370920651170</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 23:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370920742963-204</Id><Title>$399 ps4</Title><Msg>goodbye xbox1 preorder</Msg><Username>lting77</Username><Timestamp>1370920742963</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 23:19:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370921564414-205</Id><Topic><Title>$399 ps4</Title><Username>lting77</Username><Timestamp>1370920742963</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 23:19:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's fine my friend. MSFT isn't in this to sell a box to someone looking for the cheapest price who only borrows games from their friends, and isn't a highly profitable customer. MSFT is serious about making boookoooooo $ from this business unit. And they will. MSFT has the best partners, the best games, the best additions to the box like fantasy football, viewing your game highlights in the cloud,, etc... My guess is that in the end, you'll wish you bought XBox One. Those who can afford to extra $100, and who can afford to actually pay for their games, will get a better experience with XBox One. And MSFT will earn much greater profits that Sony.</Msg><Username>oncmillionaire</Username><Timestamp>1370921564414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 23:32:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370922714179-206</Id><Topic><Title>$399 ps4</Title><Username>lting77</Username><Timestamp>1370920742963</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 23:19:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>x1 the next Saturn. hahah at this point the wii u has a fighting chance. this stock drops like a rock tomorrow. glad I sold my shares oh 10 years ago. microshit should start selling their new sht box tomorrow, they'll need that headstart</Msg><Username>gamedude246</Username><Timestamp>1370922714179</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-10 23:51:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
