Chile: Rape Ignites Abortion Debate Published: July 5, 2013 The case of a pregnant 11-year-old girl who was raped has set off a national debate about abortion in one of the most socially conservative countries in Latin America. State television reported that the girl, known only as “Belen,” is 14 weeks pregnant. Police arrested her mother’s partner, who confessed to abusing the fifth grader. Doctors say her life and that of the fetus are at high risk. But ending the pregnancy is not an option. Chile allowed abortions for medical reasons until they were outlawed in 1973 by the Pinochet dictatorship. The current government of President Sebastián Piñera has opposed any loosening of the prohibition. Many Chileans were venting outrage about the case on social media on Friday.

When Hitler’s hordes stole Germany, they stormed town-halls across the Fatherland carrying their sacred symbols of nationalism reinforced by a form of Christianity that lent moral credence to mob rule. In fact, Nazism could not have risen had it not been for German evangelicals and fundamentalists embedded within the various religious sects and denominations. German Christians were seduced by the allure of national pride, and in doing so, the flag, eagle, and swastika became select idols of that time – images so sacred anyone caught desecrating them were put to death. Twenty-first century America is encumbered by a mass cult which is stripping away the nation’s constitutional rights, civil liberties, and potential greatness. Ironically, it is also threatening the very religious freedom for which they claim to cherish dearly. Symbols mean more than substance today. Little flag pins arouse more adoration than real acts of valor. FOX’s America preferred to investigate (and lie about) John Kerry’s medals than George Bush’s AWOL, cocaine use, and draft-dodging. FOX’s America preferred to perpetrate the Obama birth certificate myth than investigate torture and treason. Barack without a tie in the Oval Office elicited more outrage than Blackwater’s murders. It is symbolism the right-wing is after, not reality. Surface outweighs substance. Not only the flag, but the cross and Bible are erected as idols. And sadly, the national idolatry cult has racial overtones – like the original fascist movement 80 years before. Nazis venerated the flag, the swastika, Mein Kampf, and the eagle. The American right-wing venerates the flag, the cross, the Bible and the eagle. The parallels can’t be more apparent.</Msg><Username>beemerbe</Username><Timestamp>1373118616175</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 09:50:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373123772465-14</Id><Topic><Title>YOU could be next if the radical left gains complete control</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373116849374</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-06 09:20:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree totally. The Bible warns of false prophets and witnesses. Since the tea party has no fact, not one, to support their hatred towards Obama, the similarities to prewar Germany are clear. They cloak themselves under the Constitution and Bible to appear like something they're not. They accuse others, when it is they who are doing the wrongs. The danger is from them, with all their hoardes of guns, not the government. Already we see cases of murder with concealed weapon, being disguised as self defense with lies and acting.
