Only 6 PE is 30% of sector average......Strong 2013 guidance calls for over 40 % revenue growth and $1/share net income .…..Two Cloud divisions are growing exponentially …Insiders have purchased 5% of company since 2010 and never sold a share. 4 million share float…. In 2010 NTWK went from $8 to $24 in 4 weeks with 50% lower revenue than today.</Title><Msg>Short-term Target: $16 per Upgrade……… Record 1Q 2013 earnings 2 weeks away…….radar this one In 2010 global software provider Netsol Technologies (NASDAQ: NTWK) went from $8 to $24 in a few weeks. Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including 2 new high-growth high-margin Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q 2012 CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

Nonetheless, the bulls were unable to generate any follow through buying at that juncture and a failure signal was given as the stock fell down to 30.23 just 4 weeks later. One more attempt was made to regenerate the upward momentum the very next week with a rally up to 32.89 (5 points below the previous high) but the rally failed again causing a double top to be created on the weekly chart and a drop down to 28.32 where the 50-week MA stopped further downside. MSFT proceeded to move slowly higher for the next 15 weeks reaching a high at 31.61 where a reversal week occurred suggesting that the double top had been tested successfully. For the past 5 weeks the stock has been moving lower and 2 weeks ago the 50-week MA was broken and then confirmed this past week with a second red close in a row. MSFT reported earnings on Thursday evening and they failed to impress causing the stock to gap down on Friday and make a new 3-month intra-week and daily closing low. The stock closed on the lows of the day and further downside is expected to be seen this coming week. Important 9-month intra-week support is found at 28.32 but having gapped down, seen a low on Friday of 28.58, closing just 6 points off of the low, and having had a 58 point trading range, the probabilities are high that level of support will be broken. To the downside and below 28.32, MSFT shows no support whatsoever until the 200-week MA, currently at 26.33 is reached. It is important to note that the stock shows a gap on the daily and weekly chart from last December between 26.15 and 26.39 that is going to be a magnet for the traders and based on the earnings report, the market likely heading lower, and the chart action seen in the stock the possibilities of that level being reached this coming week are high. MSFT had a high last week at 29.74 which is exactly where the 50-week MA is currently at. As such, it is unlikely that level will be broken. By the same token, it is also unlikely that Friday's gap area between 29.08 and 29.26 will be closed unless the indexes generate a rally on Monday. Sales of MSFT between Friday's close at 28.64 and up to 28.85 and using a stop loss at 29.84 and having an objective of at least 26.13 will offer a 3-1 risk/reward ratio. My rating on the trade is a 4 (on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the highest). My name is Tony and I am a retired chartist. I have been trading for over 36 years. In the 80's I was a broker/trader/analyst for Merrill Lynch, Dean Witter, and Pru-Bache. I offer an inexpensive chart evaluation service on stocks of your choice through membership to my newsletter and message board. “When or where do I get in? When or where do I get out? What is the trend for the next week? For the next 3 months? Where are the strong buyers and where are the strong sellers (based on past action)? What is the risk/reward ratio on my trade (based on chart objectives)? What looks good right now (chart-wise)?” These are some of the questions that I try to answer through chart evaluation. I offer a monthly service that includes a weekly newsletter with chart evaluations on 4 stocks that I believe have attractive chart patterns and good risk/reward ratios as well as 1 chart evaluation per week on a stock of your choice. Evaluations include entry and stop loss points as well as likely objectives. The service also includes membership to a message board where daily updates on all stocks and stock indexes are given. A 2-week Trial at no charge is offered.

With the chart break in the stock, the indexes on the verge of breaking down, and the fundamental picture with Windows 8, the probabilities of this stock getting down to 25.70 has now increased strongly. Keep a close eye on 13250 in the DOW (13276 on a daily closing basis). If the DOW breaks that support it will likely head down to at least 13000. If the NAZ breaks below 2970 it will likely get down to 2873.

I offer my knowledge because I do the work anyhow so why not share it with others and have everyone make a little extra. As far as your statement about everyone seeing the same thing, if that was the case then everyone would be rich wouldn't they? From what I know, only a small percentage of traders make money in the market. Nonetheless, your statement does have some validity so I will answer it: "I have been offering my knowledge since January 2007 and so far in the 6 years since I have not had a losing year yet and that includes 2008 when most everyone lost money. The results are public and available for anyone to see. In addition, the mentions I made are "before" the fact and not "after" and that means that everyone could have taken advantage of them. I offer chart knowledge as well as 37 years of trading experience that includes some guidelines to trading that most people do not follow but that will help everyone who follows them to be more successful. In addition, I give "specific" desired entry points, stop loss points and objectives. It does allow a trader to fine tune their risk and reward ratios.

(CBSDC) — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took off the gloves during a campaign rally for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in Virginia. Speaking before supporters at Ball Office Products in Richmond Friday, Christie ripped into President Barack Obama. “You’ve been living inside 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. for the last four years,” Christie said. “If you don’t think you can change Washington from inside the White House let’s give you the plane ticket back to Chicago you’ve earned.” Christie riled up the Richmond crowd saying that Obama is arrogant for believing he can’t change Washington politics. “If he believes that, then what the hell is he doing asking for another four years?” Christie said. “We’re happy to give you a bus ticket to the outside, Mr. President.” Christie added that Obama is “blindly walking around the White House looking for a clue.” “He’s like a man wandering around a dark room, hands up against the wall, clutching for the light switch of leadership and he just can’t find it.” Obama and Romney will take part in the third and final presidential debate Monday night.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350928690309</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:58:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350928845625-98</Id><Topic><Title>The Musllim and his monkeys are in full blown panic mode</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350922628485</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 12:17:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>President Obama appears to getting reelection support from three world leaders notorious for their anti-American views. Venezuela President Hugo Chavez, after winning a fourth term earlier this month, reportedly said he would vote for Obama and that the president would likely vote for him. The socialist-leaning ruler also reportedly called Obama a “good guy.” His support follows that of the Castro family, which has ruled Cuba under a communist dictatorship for more than 50 years. In June, Mariela Castro, the daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro, said in a CNN interview, translated into English: “As a citizen of the world, I would like (Obama) to win.” And Russian President Vladimir Putin -- who is back in Moscow's driver's seat after a stint as prime minister -- has said the reelection of Obama could improve political relations between the two countries. He also reportedly called Obama a “genuine person" who "really wants to change much for the better." However, Putin also told The Wall Street Journal he is prepared to work with Mitt Romney, who once called Russia the United States’ “No. 1 geopolitical foe.” Putin characterized the Republican presidential nominee’s stance as "pre-election rhetoric." While Obama certainly didn't ask for the support of any of those three leaders, the president has come to Russia's defense on the campaign trail. In his Democratic nomination speech last month, Obama mocked Romney's comment saying "you don't call Russia our number one enemy -- not Al Qaeda, Russia -- unless you're still stuck in a Cold War mind warp." While some foreign leaders are watching the U.S. election and observing from afar, other foreign officials are planning to make a visit, supposedly to make sure things go smoothly. United Nations affiliates from Europe and central Asia are reportedly coming to the U.S. to monitor the Nov. 6 elections. The monitors will go to polling stations to watch for voter suppression activities by conservative groups, according to The Hill newspaper. The paper reports the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe -- a United Nations partner -- will deploy 44 monitors, part of a larger mission that will send an additional 80 to 90 members of parliament from nearly 30 countries. Catherine Engelbrecht, founder and president of True the Vote, a conservative-leaning group seeking to crack down on election fraud, told The Hill: “These activist groups sought assistance not from American sources, but from the United Nations. The United Nations has no jurisdiction over American elections.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350928845625</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 14:00:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350929422115-99</Id><Topic><Title>When there are no lines for Win 8 and Surface pads on Friday</Title><Username>cspanosmwc</Username><Timestamp>1350925793158</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 13:09:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can't wait to buy one, I love my windows phone, and love office, but ipad won't work with office.

Oct 22, 2012 12:36 PM Can we Trust President Barack Obama as Commander and Chief? Here is a fact, Bill Plante of CBS News reports on Obama telling Russian President Medvedev that he will work on the missile defense system with Russia after the election (March 26, 2012). ( Obama failed to turn off his microphone and this Russian message was picked up ) Lied about 911 Libya Attack - No Barack Obama Trust a Huge Problem in his Campaign Going Forward - No More people saying! One latest poll shows that many young men, women and Veterans do not trust President Barack Obama any longer. Mitt Romney today has an overwhelming support of married women with children and many young women, young men and Veterans of all ages are switching to support Mitt Romney for President of the United States of America. Tonight, the two candidates will share a stage for the last time. The race could not be closer: On Sunday, a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicated that the candidates tied, each with 47 percent of likely voters. Before the debates began, Obama led the same poll by 3points. In this debate, Obama could face the opposite of the situation many envisioned weeks before. Instead of lending him credibility, his commander-in-chief role could make him more vulnerable, opening Obama to questions about a range of unresolved crises. Romney is likely to renew criticism of the Obama administration’s reaction to a Sept. 11 attack that killed four Americans at a mission in Benghazi, Libya. And Obama is also likely to face questions about the civil war in Syria, a recent assassination in Lebanon and possible signals that Iran may be willing to bargain over the future of its nuclear program. A White House official on Saturday denied a New York Times report that said the United States and Iran had agreed in principle to hold one-on-one talks about that program. The report said Iran wanted to wait until after the election for talks to begin. “It’s not true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American elections,” White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said in a written statement. The Reuters news service reported that Iran also had denied the report. Foreign-policy questions played a significant role in the last presidential debate, held last Tuesday in Long Island, N.Y. Romney was caught flat-footed with an overly broad statement that Obama had taken two weeks to label the attack in Benghazi an “act of terror.” Romney was corrected by moderator Candy Crowley: Although Obama did not directly call the attack terrorism the next day, he did say that the U.S. will not retreat from “acts of terror.” Since then, Romney has said little about Libya on the campaign trail. Advisers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal-campaign thinking, said Romney deliberately turned his focus away from Libya and toward the domestic economy and gas prices following the last debate. His arguments on those issues had polled well among viewers last week, the advisers said. But Libya is almost certain to come up again tonight.</Msg><Username>obama_whisper_russia</Username><Timestamp>1350938427630</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:40:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350938465560-117</Id><Topic><Title>How the President lies and the press gives him a pass</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1350463715300</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 04:48:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama Caught Telling Russian Leader To Wait Until After Election On Missile Defense By obama_whisper_russia .

In fact a tablet user does not want a fold-out back either since a tablet is just held on a knee and then tapped on the screen. No one wants a tablet with things flopping around. A home docking station for a tablet is okay but the carry-tablet must be one piece. Also, the price of the Surface is just intended to maintain profit margins. Most hardware makers don't get those kind of margins. So a regular hardware maker will easily beat the price of the Surface. And then MS will be back to selling operating systems. Then the big advantage of Win RT on ARM is Word and Excel. However, this will just be something like an applet version of Word and Excel but I suppose who cares as long as it supports the file formats. Well, I'm not impressed with a computer form factor that depends heavily on an internet connection. Here's an example, many download files and documents are going to PDF. And so that encourages storage of the downloads and then offline reading. It's just easier to save and use PDF files than HTML files. Well, are ARM tablets good PDF readers ? Maybe so... So back to the home docking station. The home docking station can be connected to the cable modem for use at home. The carry tablet only has WiFi and is only good when sitting in WiFi. But who needs a home docking station for a tablet when they probably do have a desktop computer at home ? The tablet only needs to transfer files to the home computer. The tablet is for carry and travel but it would have more security if it would plug into a hotel ethernet instead of just relying totally on WiFi. (Just go tell the hotels what could be expected because they have gone to WiFi off the cable TV box.) Also, consider that 22nm Ivy Bridge mobile processors can compete with the current cost of ARM tablets. It's just that the IA processors are not designed for the tablet experience but for fully functioning laptops.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1350938539310</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:42:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350938860034-120</Id><Topic><Title>xcrewshe8n and his monkeys are in full blown panic mode</Title><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1350931383441</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 14:43:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm not paniced about anything. the heck your arent- you are seeing the end of your RWNJ bagger flat earth world and you cant stand it- typical reaction from a marxist commie soshulist. you are a traitor to your president and to y our self</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1350938860034</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:47:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350939403511-121</Id><Topic><Title>“Believe in Duh 1%” - Romney</Title><Username>typikkkal_headcase_teaturdddd</Username><Timestamp>1350939282262</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 16:54:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh!

But yet he has no problem letting his Marxist brother Venezuela Chavez drill in the Gulf of Mexico. And that's because his master, George Soros, owns 1.1 million shares of Brazilian, Petrobras Oil. Hussein will do whatever he can to choke the life out of our country in order to keep his country, Kenya and surrounding Musllim countries, strong.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350962877510</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:27:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350962979649-177</Id><Topic><Title>Two things one must believe to support Obama.</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1350947552748</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 19:12:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He saved the autos WITH a government bailout He was born in Hawaii</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1350962979649</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:29:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350963558781-178</Id><Topic><Title>Will there be an 8" Windows 8 RT announced on the 26?</Title><Username>moneystockinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1350961131573</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 22:58:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From the data on the iPad mini; it main aim is at the education marketplace and it is a dumb down version of the iPad2 with very low screen resolution built in. Retina screen might follow in iPad mini2 but from my sources it built to be cheap because the buyers are suppose to be school systems. You get what you pay for. Apple products always has the highest profit margins in electronics; way above anyone elses. If Apple charges $299 for it; it cost them 45%($135) to make it since they have an average profit margin of 55%!</Msg><Username>moneystockinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1350963558781</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:39:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350963807555-179</Id><Title>The crazy psycho savage Monkey is out of his malicious maniacal Musllim mind!</Title><Msg>Time to get the tranquilizer dart and put him back in his cage.

Romney was caught up in remembering his talking point coaches point about more ships then than now, but forgot to understand wood vs. steel, bayonet vs cruise missle. Romney forgot to think. It showed on his face the whole debate. He knows Obama is the better man. OMG Romney is ready for the nursing home where he can bark orders all day at his attendants. And those Romney coaches where did they find them, the tea party? I almost expected Romney to say, you know what, I agree with you on everything and you are the better man, so I'm voting for you, Mr. President. I give up.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1350964504463</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-22 23:55:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
