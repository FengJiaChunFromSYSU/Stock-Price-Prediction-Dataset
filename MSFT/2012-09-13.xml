He's consistent with his prior behavior in this; consider his previous exploitation of the big dig ceiling collapse to launch a ham-handed and ultimately unproductive "rescue" effort that left the state worse off than if he'd taken a more measured approach. It's also consistent with his exploitation of the corruption of his close associates in the Utah business community's corruption to aggrandize himself with a billion-dollar taxpayer funded bailout. It's not inconsistent with his vulture capitalist business model of preying on both investors and employees of established companies that he leverages with debt in his "management" take-over schemes.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images In a separate report, a sharp rise in gasoline costs drove up wholesale prices last month by the most in more than three years. But outside energy and food, price gains were mild. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 15,000 to a seasonally adjusted 382,000, the highest in two months, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The prior week's figure was revised up to show 2,000 more applications than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 370,000 last week. A Labor Department official said Tropical Storm Isaac, which drenched parts of the country, accounted for about 9,000 of the claims filed last week. The number is unadjusted. But even accounting for the storm, the report suggested little improvement in the labor market after job growth slowed sharply in August. The four-week moving average for new claims, a better measure of labor market trends, climbed 3,250 to 375,000, the highest since the middle of July. Employers added 96,000 jobs last month, a step down from July's 141,000 count. While the unemployment rate dropped to 8.1 percent in August from 8.3 percent, it was because Americans gave up the search for work. RELATED LINKS Highest-Paying Jobs Import Prices Rise Most Expensive States The sluggish labor market is seen prompting the Federal Reserve to announce a third round of bond purchases at the end of a two-day policy meeting later on Thursday. The unemployment rate has been stuck above 8 percent for more than three years, the first time this has happened since the Great Depression. The number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid fell 49,000 to 3.28 million in the week ended Sept. 1, the claims report showed. Producer Price Index Higher The Labor Department says that the producer price index, which measures price changes before they reach the consumer, jumped 1.7 percent in August. The increase was mostly because gas prices soared 13.6 percent, the biggest gain in three years. Food prices rose 0.9 percent, driven up by steep increases in the cost of eggs and dairy products. Excluding the volatile food and gas categories, core wholesale prices rose only 0.2 percent, below July's increase. In the past 12 months, wholesale prices have increased 2 percent, a mild gain and far below the recent peak of 7.1 percent in July 2011.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347540900279</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 08:55:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347540989879-46</Id><Topic><Title>Romney In Trouble....</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1347511112937</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 00:38:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>09/13/12 RASMUSSEN POLL: ROMNEY JUMPS BACK INTO LEAD...

But, not Netanyahu. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lectured Barack Obama in the Oval Office on the dangers facing the Jews back in May 2011. But… Barack Obama won’t meet with Israeli leader Netanyahu over Iran row. He’s going to be campaigning and on Letterman. Reuters reported: The White House has rejected a request by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to meet President Barack Obama in the United States this month, an Israeli official said on Tuesday, after a row erupted between the allies over Iran’s nuclear programme. An Israeli official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Netanyahu’s aides had asked for a meeting when he visits the United Nations this month, and “the White House has got back to us and said it appears a meeting is not possible. It said that the president’s schedule will not permit that”. Netanyahu has met with Obama on all the Israeli leader’s U.S. trips since 2009. Earlier today President Muhammad Morsi promised to sue the US filmmakers who produced a movie that insulted the prophet Mohammad. UPDATE: Barack Obama told NBC tonight “I don’t think that we would consider (Egypt) an ally.” (Maybe he should have thought about that before he through Mubarak under the bus!)</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1347545086444</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 10:04:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347545219483-56</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Incompetent Unqualified Clownish Crook</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1347544201541</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 09:50:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He is so out of touch, he should quit now, besides another tax return will have to be shown soon.

It wasn't much of a challenge, but it showed just how desperate she was, Bullock told NBC News on returning from his 10th straight summer cruise to the Arctic. That desperation, he feels, stems from the fact that the Arctic's summer sea ice — which polar bears using as floating stations from which to hunt seals — has been shrinking over the last few decades due to a warming Arctic, forcing polar bears into smaller areas and more intense competition. "She was the thinnest female with cub I have ever seen," he said. "She had a single cub which implies she has already lost one other cub this year. "If she cannot feed, she cannot suckle her cub; with a hungry cub it is even harder for her to hunt effectively, so from what I saw her last cub is at risk and ultimately so is she," he added. "This is why she was challenging a big male with food. She was hungry enough to take a big risk." *********************************************************************************** YOU MMGW DENIARS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

Eventually, updates for XP will end though, or your system will crash and you will purchase a new pc/laptop/whatever. That new equipment will likely come with a Windows license. -- OR -- you can buy w/out an OS and run LINUX, which likely will do everything you need it to (based on your usage statements). Note that you probably won't have many avenues of support outside the web forums. This is where, if you should encounter some problem, could be down for a much longer period of time than with Windows where there are more readily available support avenues. If you are proficient you will be back up and running in a reasonable amount of time either way, but will have spent your own time recovering. The strength for Microsoft Windows truly ties back to the corporate infrastructures. Microsoft PC's are primarily deployed to corporate users on networks primarily running Microsoft servers. Workers who want to integrate from their homes can do so much more easily using Windows PC's than the alternatives -- and may not receive I/S support for any other option if they have issues. So why do most US corporations choose Microsoft over the alternatives for MOST operations? It comes down to cost and the availability of human resources to manage and program the systems. -- Or -- you could spend boatloads on an Apple, which runs a version of UNIX, and also may or may not get support integrating to your corporate network (if you work for a corporation). With the MAC, you get the I'm cool factor in the box. Funny how most MAC owners I know are basic users who can't articulate what makes it different/better/worse than anything else except for the brand name. That is why most users will end up with a machine running Windows 8, eventually.</Msg><Username>bill_meister</Username><Timestamp>1347575278792</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 18:27:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347575796298-129</Id><Topic><Title>I am still getting updates for Windows XP - Why do I need Windows 8?</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1347560804668</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 14:26:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FOAD, wally-the#$%$ Linux has won.

In October 2009, I explained why "Apple cannot win the smartphone wars". That was just a year after Google launched the first Android handset, the G1, on T-Mobile and days after Verizon debuted the hugely-successful Motorola Droid. By end of that year, Android had paltry 3.9 percent smartphone sales share, according to Gartner. My prediction drew loads of criticism from the Apple Fan Club of bloggers, journalists and other writers. Fast-forward to second quarter 2012 and Android's global sales share is 64.1 percent for all phones, not just smart ones. iOS: 18.8 percent. My how times change. Increasingly, Android and iOS look exactly like Windows and Mac OS in the 1980s and 1990s, as I predicted would be the case. By the way, three years ago, Gartner prediced that for 2012, Symbian would be top-ranked with 37.4 percent share, followed by Android (18 percent) and iOS (13.6 percent). Opps. Two days ago, Android chief Andy Rubin revealed startling data: Cumulative device shipments reached 500 million, putting Google's OS ahead of Apple's for the first time. During Apple's calendar second quarter earnings call, CFO Peter Oppenheimer put cumulative iOS sales at 410 million through June 30. Strangely, yesterday, CEO Tim Cook reduced the number to 400 million. WTH? Looking ahead, IHS iSuppli now predicts that cumulative Android smartphone shipments will reach 1 billion next year, but iOS not until 2015. The war is over, and Android won.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347579136611</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 19:32:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347579289041-143</Id><Topic><Title>No marines at the embassy</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1347491617112</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-12 19:13:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stupid.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1347579289041</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-13 19:34:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347579322206-144</Id><Title>"Make no mistake...": Obamanure does'nt know if Egypt is an ally!</Title><Msg>"The State Department, cutting through the confusion over President Obama's claim that Egypt is not a U.S. ally, contradicted his characterization Thursday.
