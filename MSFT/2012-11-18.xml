I don't know how you can go back and undo history from your chair. Here it tis again. I bolded some of the words related to ATTACK. No, the 9/11/01 reference doesn't take away from the specific topic, of the specific attack on Libya on 9/11/12. That's your search for an out, not flying, the whole speech was done because of the libya attack.The day before he already spoke on 9/11/01. Who's the bald faced liar now? You are: "Rose Garden 10:43 A.M. EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Every day, all across the world, American diplomats and civilians work tirelessly to advance the interests and values of our nation. Often, they are away from their families. Sometimes, they brave great danger. Yesterday, four of these extraordinary Americans were killed in an ATTACK on our diplomatic post in Benghazi. Among those killed was our Ambassador, Chris Stevens, as well as Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith. We are still notifying the families of the others who were killed. And today, the American people stand united in holding the families of the four Americans in our thoughts and in our prayers. The United States condemns in the strongest terms this outrageous and shocking ATTACK. We're working with the government of Libya to secure our diplomats. I've also directed my administration to increase our security at diplomatic posts around the world. And make no mistake, we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who ATTACKED our people. Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification to this type of senseless violence. None. The world must stand together to unequivocally reject these BRUTAL ACTS. Already, many Libyans have joined us in doing so, and THIS ATTACK will not break the bonds between the United States and Libya. Libyan security personnel fought back against the ATTACKERS alongside Americans. Libyans helped some of our diplomats find safety, and they carried Ambassador Stevens’s body to the hospital, where we tragically learned that he had died. It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi because it is a city that he helped to save. At the height of the Libyan revolution, Chris led our diplomatic post in Benghazi. With characteristic skill, courage, and resolve, he built partnerships with Libyan revolutionaries, and helped them as they planned to build a new Libya. When the Qaddafi regime came to an end, Chris was there to serve as our ambassador to the new Libya, and he worked tirelessly to support this young democracy, and I think both Secretary Clinton and I relied deeply on his knowledge of the situation on the ground there. He was a role model to all who worked with him and to the young diplomats who aspire to walk in his footsteps. Along with his colleagues, Chris died in a country that is still striving to emerge from the recent experience of war. Today, the loss of these four Americans is fresh, but our memories of them linger on. I have no doubt that their legacy will live on through the work that they did far from our shores and in the hearts of those who love them back home. Of course, yesterday was already a painful day for our nation as we marked the solemn memory of the 9/11 attacks. We mourned with the families who were lost on that day. I visited the graves of troops who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hallowed grounds of Arlington Cemetery, and had the opportunity to say thank you and visit some of our wounded warriors at Walter Reed. And then last night, we learned the news of this attack in Benghazi. As Americans, let us never, ever forget that our freedom is only sustained because there are people who are willing to fight for it, to stand up for it, and in some cases, lay down their lives for it. Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe. NO ACTS OF TERROR will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for THIS TERRIBLE ACT. And make no mistake, justice will be done. But we also know that the lives these Americans led stand in stark contrast to those of THEIR ATTACKERS. These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity. They should give every American great pride in the country that they served, and the hope that our flag represents to people around the globe who also yearn to live in freedom and with dignity. We grieve with their families, but let us carry on their memory, and let us continue their work of seeking a stronger America and a better world for all of our children. Thank you.

Referring to 9/11/01 as being the only acts of terror he was referring to is a product of your fried brains. Where does it say "spontaneous acts"? Nowhere. It isn't important what words were said. The GOP is still trying to politicize this issue, as if the election was still ahead. The election is over. For four years faux news has made every act of the President a wrong act.

When he said acts of terror he was absolutely referring to Benghazi, the SUBJECT, moe, of the speech. Moe, give up. He never ever lied, he said acts of terror. I just showed you he said it in the transcript. As he told romney at the debate, look at the transcript. Candy said the same thing and was right. What happened during the next two weeks wasn't romney's claim, romney claimed the Pres said "spontaneous demonstrations" in the rose garden specifically. He was called out on it and made a fool of. Obviously romney was getting his facts from faux news. Just like you do. Not once has anyone shown one lie from Obama, not one, he is one very honest man. That is another reason he was elected. I am done mow, you have been proven wrong many times on this, and this is all there is. Goo ahead rant on, you're still wrong.

This new OS feels ahead of the curve on major issues like multitasking, task switching and displaying multiple apps on the screen at the same time. I was always told that marketshare is lost and gained in periods of transition. Microsoft missed the first major transition to new ARM based smartphones and tablets, but it’s perfectly positioned to ride the wave to notebook/tablet convergence. In fact, when it comes to figuring out how to merge those two platforms I don’t believe Apple or Google have a reasonable solution at this point. In Apple’s world the two are distinctly separate, while Google is arguably even worse off as it doesn’t have a good notebook OS at this point (the verdict is still out on Chrome OS, as promising as the new Samsung Chromebook appears to be). It’s unclear how big this convertible/hybrid market will grow, but I see real potential here. There are users who want an iPad and I don’t believe Microsoft does anything to change their minds. The iPad and iOS remain a very polished, very accessible platform that is really optimized for content consumption and light productivity. For anyone who wanted more however, there’s now an alternative: Windows RT.</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1353284868315</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 19:27:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353284900316-41</Id><Topic><Title>Nokia lumia 920 awesome w8 phone</Title><Username>cbyankows</Username><Timestamp>1353268026897</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 14:47:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The best celphone by far is the Nokia Lumia 920.</Msg><Username>jaceanne_gibson</Username><Timestamp>1353284900316</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 19:28:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353286714987-42</Id><Title>Is cfuryurself</Title><Msg>really a janitor.

The bizzare path seemed impossible except that several unusual elements were in place that predicted the path. 1. The sea temps in the Gulf Stream were 5 degrees above normal. Sandy fed off the Gulf Stream. 2. The low level of sea ice actually changed the course of the jet stream. Euro Climate models were the only computers to predict that Sandy would hook west at NY City. It was only later that the American models caught up and predicted same path. 3. The sea levels as measured by the Harbor Commission in NY documented a one foot rise since 1900. This factor contributed to the unprecidented flooding. Both American and European Climate modeling are predicting the melting ot the Polar Caps.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1353287153711</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 20:05:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353287683478-44</Id><Topic><Title>Nixon lied, nobody died and he lost his job</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1353190469493</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-17 17:14:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right on</Msg><Username>tomuch2491</Username><Timestamp>1353287683478</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 20:14:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353289180824-45</Id><Topic><Title>Is cfuryurself</Title><Username>just_1_more_bing</Username><Timestamp>1353286714987</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 19:58:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nope, i am an enguniier, a cleanliness enguneer.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1353289180824</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 20:39:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353289516347-46</Id><Title>It's two years until the next election so RWNJ are not posting to swing electorate, they post to make</Title><Msg>themselves feel better about being constantly wrong.

Anyway, it took me over an hour to get someone live and then they had to transfer me to a real "technician"...OK fine...another 20 minutes finally this guy comes on from the Philippines (where else right?) and his accent is heavy and the line quality poor.A few minutes of conversation and then he tells me it will be 99 bucks for any real support or he could email me some additional links. I said fine. Now, 6 hours later still no email. But I have a case number at least. Anyone else find going through MSFT tech support to be a real pain and seemingly fruitless? This company has some real problems and this appears to be one of them. And no, I'm not an Apple user bashing softie just relaying my frustration and disappointment. I may well end up taking the laptop back to shop that installed the new hd if this route doesn't work.</Msg><Username>colorado_dude4u</Username><Timestamp>1353296264854</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 22:37:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353296670339-50</Id><Topic><Title>I love Linux!</Title><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1353259366462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 12:22:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are lots of alternatives to Windows 8 and Metro tiles.
