The task has become overwhelmingly complex because it involves integrating and then reliably operating layers of infrastructure components, applications written using different methodologies, and operating systems for the various devices, all from different generations. And this must be achieved within complicated security and legal frameworks, without negatively impacting the user experience. For more than 20 years, Microsoft was the glue that held everything together. Enterprises bought Windows-compatible hardware and ran Windows applications. The secret for reducing costs was to standardize hardware and software configurations and to optimize processes for commissioning, maintenance and support, and decommissioning. Over the years, despite standardization, nonstandard hardware and applications crept in. Executives insisted on adopting more devices, and Windows-only application compatibility became a thing of the past. Applications today require not only a minimum Windows version, but also a complicated mix of certain versions of additional components, like Flash or Java, or certain Windows service packs and configurations to run. Various solutions were developed to address these issues; OS and application virtualization proved especially invaluable. However, despite vendor promises and IT’s best efforts to simplify the systems, complexity and management costs continued to increase. Bottom line: IT is trapped in a web of legacy constraints from implemented technology and on-going licensing contracts. .... Roadblocks to Simplicity IT is understandably reluctant to move away from their large investment in today’s established image management solutions. And IT staff has been trained extensively in operating end-user devices management under the current paradigm. At a more fundamental level, Microsoft’s product and licensing structures are perhaps the biggest roadblock to change. .... .... VMware Changes the Game When VMware acquired Wanova earlier this year, it showed that VMware’s management deeply understood the inevitable technical solution: provide images centrally from the cloud, deliver them to virtual and physical machines, with users being able to access applications and data from anywhere. VMware leverages image layering to assemble images in the background and deploys them to the devices on reboot, just like a firmware update. After rebooting, the device is 100% compliant and matches the target image identically. Best of all, without on-device virtualization, the Windows license for that device remains valid. The implications are greater still. As Wanova’s solution ultimately replaces the need for client based software installation services, solutions such as Microsoft SCCM or IBM Tivoli may be needed in only very few cases. Microsoft and IBM will certainly assert that the client-based approach offers unique benefits, but VMware’s solution offer a rare opportunity to escape from the Microsoft licensing web. Your business, compliance, and audit groups will thank you as you will save instead of sinking money into managing Windows end-points the old way.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343149229000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 13:00:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343149406000-10</Id><Topic><Title>Escaping the Microsoft Web: The Future of Managing Windows in the Enterprise</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343149229000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 13:00:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Correcting the link.... http://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2012/07/24/escaping-the-microsoft-web-the-future-of-managing-windows-in-the-enterprise/2/</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343149406000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-24 13:03:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343152278000-11</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's vow to take on Apple: More bluster than truth</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343064428000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 13:27:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;&gt;(;-) Look how well they have already done!
