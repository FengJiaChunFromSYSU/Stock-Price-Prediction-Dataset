Quoting: "Samsung should send Google (GOOG) a thank-you note for developing the Android operating system. The South Korean electronics giant has taken the free-to-use, open-source software and built a massive smartphone business around it. "In the fourth quarter, Samsung accounted for 31.1% of smartphone sales worldwide, putting it in the lead, research firm Gartner reported Wednesday. Apple (AAPL), which uses its proprietary iOS operating system in its iPhone handsets, followed with 20.9% market share. China's Huawei Technologies leapfrogged from fifth place to third over BlackBerry (BBRY) and Taiwan's HTC, the previous No. 3 and No. 4 vendors, respectively. "Google's Android, used by many makers, dominates the global smartphone market with a 69.7% share, followed by Apple-only iOS. Among Android vendors, Samsung was No. 1 with 42.5% market share in Q4. Huawei was a distant No. 2, at 6%. " "The Android brand is being overshadowed by Samsung's brand, with the Galaxy name nearly a synonym for Android phones in consumers' mind share," Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta said in a statement." ________________________________________ The shame of it is that Nokia could have done the same, if its management were a bit savvier.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1360828445040</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 02:54:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360837859820-7</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro among top best sellers of all tablets at Best Buy</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1360811375411</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 22:09:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Harware is new to msft, and any sales from Surfaces not only contribute to msft growth but most importantly solidify msft's dominance of WIn 8 and Offcie over the long term.</Msg><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1360837859820</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 05:30:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360838537111-8</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro 64 GB now widely avaliableat Bestbuy, Surface Pro 128 GB will be this Saterday</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1360747232814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 04:20:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>just checked as of Thursday morning, Surface 64 GB looks like sold out again in most of my nerghborhood Best Buy stores.

In fact, it’s one of the least repairable devices iFixit has seen: In a teardown of Microsoft’s tablet-laptop hybrid, the company gave it a rock-bottom score of just one — one! — out of 10 for repairability, lower even than Apple’s iPad and the Windows Surface RT. Let’s begin with its screen. It’s held in place with what iFixit calls “a metric duckload of adhesive,” meaning it’s pretty much superglued in place. You’ll need a heat gun and some guitar picks to even pry it off the device. There’s more super-sticky adhesive inside. The battery is so strongly glued in place that you’ll need a new back cover if you ever have to replace the battery. Not that you’d want to. The majority of people who decide to take apart a Surface Pro will most likely break it. Four cables surround the inside perimeter of the display, so you will cut one of them unless you’re extremely careful.:: not all bad tho. good battery, small fans make it quiet.</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1360861871979</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 12:11:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360861995068-29</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro among top best sellers of all tablets at Best Buy</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1360811375411</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-13 22:09:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Harware is new to msft," No, it's not.

Samsung shipped 63.7 million smartphones in the fourth quarter, an increase of 76 percent from the year before, while Apple shipped a company-record 47.8 million, a 29.2 percent increase. Together the two companies made up just over half of the global smartphone market. The total smartphone market in the quarter was 219.4 million units, up 36.4 percent from 2011. That represented 45.5 percent of the total mobile phone market, the highest percentage ever, IDC said. The remaining companies among the top five vendors were: China’s Huawei, 10.8 million; Sony Corp., 9.8 million; and China’s ZTE, 9.5 million.</Msg><Username>einho330</Username><Timestamp>1360872037357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:00:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360872596623-50</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro is a monstor success.

It seems installing a copy of the latest version of Microsoft's Office suite of apps ties it to a single machine. For life. On previous versions of Office it was a different story. The suite was associated with a 'Licensed Device' and could only be used on a single device.
