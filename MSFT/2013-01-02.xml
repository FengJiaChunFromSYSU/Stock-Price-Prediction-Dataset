There was some weird year in selling in the stock at the end of the year and now today it shot up big on volume. Now we are trading at a nearly one month high. Below 30 this is way undervalued. I bought a ton of this stock under 27. Don't think it will be less than 30 for long.</Msg><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1357168059945</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 18:07:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357168457120-73</Id><Topic><Title>My prediction of a MSFT double....</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1357155106643</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:31:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At 8x forward earnings this one looks ridiculously under priced. I think if we see win tablets and win phones really take off like I am expecting over the next 1 to 2 years, than I can easily see them earning 4.50 a share a couple of years out, and then you put a 15x multiple on it and you have 60-70 dollar stock a couple of years out. A double a couple of years out really isn't out of the question.</Msg><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1357168457120</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 18:14:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357169584884-74</Id><Topic><Title>My little microsoft trade</Title><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1354305866121</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 15:04:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ended the day today with the spread worth $2.30...significantly in the money.

However, msft has also been safe and idling for the last decade. They made profits with their dominence in software, but only until now that they venture into Hardware. Windows 8 is different from other windows versions because it allows collaboration of touchpads to PC's-- allmost nearly as important as discovering the first software. Thus, it will revive the slump in PC business and allows more gaming in touchpads/laptops. On one hand, it doesn't hurt to buy in at 27 and if it cycles back to 33, you will still profit. If msft takes off because of Window 8 and surface, then you will double and triple your equity. Which ever way you look at it, it is a strong buy at these levels.</Msg><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1357183804296</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 22:30:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357183960786-88</Id><Topic><Title>My prediction of a MSFT double....</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1357155106643</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 14:31:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MSFT double?
