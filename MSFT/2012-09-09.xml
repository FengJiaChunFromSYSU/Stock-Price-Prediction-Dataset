Romney said that lowering rates will not decrease revenue because of closing loopholes. 1. Romney REFUSES to specify which loopholes he would close (and for good reason)! If it were known which loopholes were to be closed you could score the Ryan tax plan. You would know for certainty if the numbers will add up or not. But they are not talking, just a wink and a nod! 2. If tax reforms do not decrease revenues that means billionaires will be paying the same amount in taxes, bottom line. So what would be the point of reform???. Wealthy tax payers pay the same.No change in revenues? Where's the reform? It's telling that none of the Ryan budget and tax reform numbers add up. Nor are they releasing any details. Nor does it pass the common sense test. Nor does it pass the gut test. Romney Ryan have a bridge to sell you but they will not release any facts about the bridge. Good luck with that if they win!

Democrats convened in Charlotte, NC, will double down on their claim that Bain Capital is really the Bain crime family. They will accuse Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Bain’s other “greedy” co-founders of stealing their winnings, evading taxes and lighting cigars with $100 bills on their yachts. But Bain’s private-equity executives have enriched dozens of organizations and millions of individuals in the Democratic base — including some who scream most loudly for President Obama’s re-election. Government-worker pension funds are the chief beneficiaries of Bain’s economic stewardship. New York-based Preqin uses public documents, news accounts and Freedom of Information requests to track private-equity holdings.

The decision, announced in a statement released by the U.S. State Department, overturns the position of former President George W. Bush's administration, which had opposed such a treaty on the grounds that national controls were better. On Wednesday Obama Took the First Major Step in a Plan to Ban All Firearms in the United States. The Obama administration intends to force gun control and a complete ban on all weapons for US citizens through the signing of international treaties with foreign nations. By signing international treaties on gun control, the Obama administration can use the US State Department to bypass the normal legislative process in Congress. Once the US Government signs these international treaties, all US citizens will be subject to those gun laws created by foreign governments. These are laws that have been developed and promoted by organizations such as the United Nations and individuals such as George Soros and Michael Bloomberg. The laws are designed and intended to lead to the complete ban and confiscation of all firearms. The Obama administration is attempting to use tactics and methods of gun control that will inflict major damage to our 2nd Amendment before US citizens even understand what has happened. Obama can appear before the public and tell them that he does not intend to pursue any legislation (in the United States) that will lead to new gun control laws, while cloaked in secrecy, his Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton is committing the US to international treaties and foreign gun control laws. Does that mean Obama is telling the truth?</Msg><Username>tomuch2491</Username><Timestamp>1347223387467</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 16:43:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347223951038-29</Id><Topic><Title>Miff Romney is good enough for Grover</Title><Username>do_your_fairshare</Username><Timestamp>1347131302021</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 15:08:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney is the perfect stooge to sign the kind of budget and tax code that the Koch Bros want as pushed by Norquist</Msg><Username>rush_limpballs_warning</Username><Timestamp>1347223951038</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 16:52:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347227125586-30</Id><Topic><Title>President Romney With offshore bank accounts to do tax reform???</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1347215011047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 14:23:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea..

If you make 2 million net you still get the first 250K at the lower rate. Even if the 38% numbers are assumed true, may or may not be, it doesn't matter, only the tax rate matters. It's income tax, not poll tax, not use tax. A rich person make X amount of middle class incomes, it doesn't matter that it is from one person or a thousand that equal the one. In America one person gets one vote to form policy, the richest to the poorest. You don't get more credits for being rich in voting. If it is hard to grasp this, get arithmetic and civics lessons. If you don't like this, move away or try to change the Constitution. Get off faux news and get some facts.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1347237250201</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 20:34:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347238064421-35</Id><Title>Romney Back-Tracks On Obamacare.
