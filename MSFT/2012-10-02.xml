(CBS) — A Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court judge, under pressure frm the Whitehouse, has ruled that the state’s controversial new voter ID law will stand, but voters without a valid picture ID card will still be able to cast their vote and have it counted. Judge Robert Simpson has effectively decided to block part of the law. Following his ruling, voters will still be asked for a valid voter ID at the poll. But if they don’t have it, they will still be able to cast their vote in the usual manner. The judge stated asking voters to provide identification is an unnecessary burden to illegal aliens. The judge suspended the portion of the law that would have required voters without valid ID to cast what is called a “provisional” ballot, which would not be counted unless the voter could produce a valid photo ID within six days after the election. Judge Simpson says he viewed the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s recent directive (see related story) as ordering that he sever the illegal portion of the law concerning the provisional ballots. So, this November’s election will look very much like this past April’s primary, in which a “soft rollout” of the new law took place (related story). Voters were asked for ID by poll officials, but those without it could still vote. Today’s ruling comes just five weeks before the election (related story). An appeal is still possible. Democrats and groups including the AARP and NAACP mounted a furious opposition to a law that Republicans say is necessary to prevent election fraud (another related story). Critics have accused Republicans of using old-fashioned Jim Crow tactics to steal the White House and have highlighted stories of registered voters struggling to get a state photo ID (more related stories). The law was already a partisan lightning rod when a top Republican lawmaker boasted that stemming voter fraud would allow GOP nominee Mitt Romney to beat President Obama in Pennsylvania.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1349187988703</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 10:26:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349188203850-30</Id><Title>The Rethugs have no intention of paying down debt and balancing the budget.

Biden made the remark at a campaign rally while arguing that Republicans would raise taxes on the middle class. He said the tax hike would be especially bad given what the middle class has been through over the last four years. “This is deadly earnest, man. This is deadly earnest,” the vice president said. “How they can justify, how they can justify raising taxes on the middle class that has been buried the last four years? How in lord's name can they justify raising their taxes with these tax cuts.” Republicans quickly seized on the remarks, accusing the Obama administration of implementing policies that have hurt the middle class. “Vice President Biden made a stunning admission today and we couldn’t agree more: the middle class has been ‘buried’ under the last four years of this President’s policies," said Romney campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg. "Under President Obama, the middle class has suffered from crushing unemployment, rising prices and falling incomes. They can’t afford to be ‘buried’ for four more years." “We agree, the middle class has been buried the past four years by Obama's failed policies from higher taxes to more debt, which is why he doesn't deserve another term in the White House to make it worse,” said Kirsten Kukowski, spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349203673068</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:47:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349203811863-51</Id><Topic><Title>FOUR YEARS AGO the economy was in free fall; jobs were disappearing at a rate of 750,000 per month; the stock market was also in free fall.</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1349194113984</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:08:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Border Agent Shot, Killed Near Major Drug Corridor Border Patrol agent killed, one other wounded, in shooting near major drug-smuggling corridor in Arizona</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1349203811863</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:50:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349203937214-52</Id><Title>Bush inherited one of the biggest market meltdowns in history from Clinton</Title><Msg>You didn't hear him whining.</Msg><Username>ghetto_trash</Username><Timestamp>1349203937214</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:52:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349204123216-53</Id><Title>Obama market running on fumes</Title><Msg>Sharp correction coming before the election.

"NEW YORK - Does the president affect your portfolio? Candidates would certainly like you to think that the answer is yes, and that the particular candidate doing the talking is better than the other guy. Over the years, several studies have shown that the stock market has fared markedly better under Democrats than Republicans. (see: "The Presidential Portfolio") The difference, according to Pedro Santa-Clara and Rossen Valkanov, both professors at the University of California Los Angeles Anderson School of Business, is much too large to be random and cannot be explained by fluctuations in the business cycle. Nor can it be explained by higher interest rates in Republican administrations. The UCLA professors looked at data going back to 1927. Our own study of the post-World War II presidencies confirms their results. We found that the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a total return of 14.1% per year under Democratic presidents since April 1945, and 11.8% under Republicans. The best total returns--17.4% per year--were under Bill Clinton, whose presidency ranked first in economic results. (see: "Presidents And Prosperity") Gerald R. Ford ranks second, followed by Harry S. Truman.

At first glance, the United States government gets props for helping Chinese human rights activist Chen Guangcheng get out of China to take a university fellowship in the U.S. But the reason Chen and his family were forced to give up everything and start their lives over in the U.S. was because of Chen’s opposition to China’s brutal one-child policy, a policy the Obama Administration continues to support financially. On this issue, the Obama Administration has blood on its hands. Only 11 days into his presidency, Obama proposed giving $50 million of U.S. taxpayers’ money to the United Nations Population Fund (known as UNFPA). UNFPA is notorious for advising and helping fund China’s population-control program, the most brutal in the world. The centerpiece of that program is China’s dictate that most families are only allowed to have one child, and only after being issued a government birth license. Women pregnant with a second child–or even an unlicensed first child–are subjected to forced abortions, infanticide of their newborns, and compulsory sterilization. Chen incurred the wrath of Chinese officials when he exposed and documented those abuses, abuses aided and abetted, even if indirectly, by grants from U.S. taxpayers. Pro-life Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush ended the funding for UNFPA. Mitt Romney has promised to do the same. But pro-abortion Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gave UNFPA hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Obama’s vice president, Joe Biden, even told an audience at a university in China “Your policy has been one which I fully understand – I’m not second-guessing – of one child per family.” Men and women throughout China have suffered so much to end this brutality. I humbly ask you to give three things, none of which will cost nearly as much as what brave activists like Chen Guangcheng have been forced to give: 1. Your vote. Vote for a pro-life President and Congress. 2. Your voice. Speak up for the unborn. 3. Your financial support. The NRL Victory Fund will use proven grassroots methods to get people out to vote for pro-life candidates, but will we have enough funds to reach everyone who needs to hear our message?</Msg><Username>be_cool_man_be_cool</Username><Timestamp>1349204807097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:06:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349204960928-58</Id><Topic><Title>Bush inherited one of the biggest market meltdowns in history from Clinton</Title><Username>ghetto_trash</Username><Timestamp>1349203937214</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Nasdaq halved from March 2000 to January 2001 when Bushie took office.

Among likely voters, 78 percent of Democrats and 56 percent of independents believe humans are warming the earth, according to a Bloomberg National Poll. That finding is consistent with other polls that show undecided voters, and majorities in contested states such as Ohio and Virginia are in line with President Barack Obama and most Democratic candidates in wanting to address the issue. “Taking a pro-climate stance is a political winner, especially for Democrats,” Edward Maibach, director for the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University, said in an interview. “It’s not the most important issue” for most undecided voters, but “it’s somewhere in their lexicon of issues.” Carbon-dioxide emissions since the industrial revolution have led to a warming of the earth’s temperature over the past 50 years, threatening to cause extreme weather, drought and coastal flooding, according to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1349215290680</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 18:01:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349216977885-81</Id><Topic><Title>Another reason to vote Romney 2012!!!</Title><Username>be_cool_man_be_cool</Username><Timestamp>1349204807097</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 15:06:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like I said, no one in their right mind would vote for romney, saying he was born in the US, without proof he was, and Obama wasn't, with a lot of proof he was, means you aren't in your right mind</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1349216977885</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 18:29:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349219469019-82</Id><Topic><Title>Global Warming Links Democrats, Independents Isolating Romney</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1349215290680</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 18:01:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No surprise there.

President Obama and Mitt Romney are deadlocked among likely voters as they prepare to square off in their first presidential debate, according to the latest United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection Poll. The survey showed that voters remain resistant to either Obama or Romney holding full control of the federal government. Obama and Romney each pulled in 47 percent support in the poll among likely voters. It is among the narrowest margins of several presidential surveys published ahead of the debate this week. Other polls have shown the president with a slim lead. In this survey, while the race is tied among likely voters, Obama has a 5-point lead, 49 percent to 44 percent, among registered voters.

Despite these reports, in public statements and private meetings, top U.S. officials spent nearly two weeks highlighting intelligence suggesting that the attacks were spontaneous protests against an anti-Muslim film, while playing down the involvement of organized militant groups. It was not until last Friday that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's office issued an unusual public statement, which described how the picture that intelligence agencies presented to U.S. policymakers had "evolved" into an acknowledgement that the attacks were "deliberate and organized" and "carried out by extremists." The existence of the early reports appears to raise fresh questions about the Obama administration's public messaging about the attack as it seeks to fend off Republican charges that the White House failed to prevent a terrorist strike that left a U.S. ambassador and three others dead. "What we're seeing now is the picture starting to develop that it wasn't a problem with the intelligence that was given, it's what they did with the intelligence that they were given," Representative Mike Rogers, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on Tuesday. "This picture is still a little fuzzy but it is starting to come into focus and it appears that there were, very early on, some indications that there was jihadist participation in the event," he said. The Obama administration has strongly defended its public accounts of what happened in Benghazi, and said its understanding has evolved as additional information came in. "At every step of the way, the administration has based its public statements on the best assessments that were provided by the intelligence community. As the intelligence community learned more information, they updated Congress and the American people on it," said White House spokesman Jay Carney. Some officials said U.S. spy agencies tried to avoid drawing premature conclusions about how the violence began and who organized it. "Unless you have very good reports that strongly suggest who was behind the attack for sure, it is prudent to be careful, because placing emphasis publicly, even tentatively, on any one group or groups too soon can lead everyone down the wrong path," said one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Republicans have sought to make the shifting stories told by administration officials about the attack, and inadequate security precautions at the U.S. diplomatic site in Libya, a major issue in the presidential campaign leading up to the November 6 election.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349228479622</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 21:41:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349228599220-96</Id><Topic><Title>Obama the marxist racist to be exposed tonite on Fox</Title><Username>ghetto_trash</Username><Timestamp>1349221073890</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 19:37:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama Camp Outspending Romney on TV Ads Published: October 2, 2012 DENVER — For every five commercials Mitt Romney and his allies ran here in this vital swing state in the last two weeks of September, President Obama and Democrats ran seven, accusing Mr. Romney of having a “tough luck” attitude toward the middle class and asserting that Mr. Obama has brought the economy back from the brink. The Election 2012 App In Florida, the disparity was even greater. The number of pro-Obama ads outnumbered pro-Romney ads by almost half — some 13,000 of them accusing Mr. Romney of outsourcing jobs to China, trying to gut Medicare, hiding his tax returns from the public, hating women and minorities and trying to suppress voters. The story was the same in most of most of the other battlegrounds. In Ohio and in Iowa, in Norfolk, Va., and on the Boston stations that feed New Hampshire, Mr. Obama out-advertised his rival after the parties’ nominating conventions, according to data compiled by the political advertising monitoring firm Kantar Media/CMAG. Mr. Obama’s continued advantage on the airwaves, which counters Democratic predictions that he would be far outgunned by Mr. Romney and his allied “super PACS” by now, may help explain why polls in most of the competitive states have shifted in his direction over the last month.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1349228599220</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 21:43:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349232993844-97</Id><Topic><Title>FOUR YEARS AGO the economy was in free fall; jobs were disappearing at a rate of 750,000 per month; the stock market was also in free fall.</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1349194113984</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 12:08:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>++Now just how is Obama responsible for the stock market?++ I'm sure you would have found a way to find him responsible if the stock market has tanked during his term, usual right wing hypocrisy...</Msg><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1349232993844</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 22:56:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349233777107-98</Id><Topic><Title>Bush inherited one of the biggest market meltdowns in history from Clinton</Title><Username>ghetto_trash</Username><Timestamp>1349203937214</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-02 14:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>President Romney will inherit a mess in January.
