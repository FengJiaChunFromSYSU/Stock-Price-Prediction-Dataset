Now, it appears that the Surface Pro will actually make its debut on May 17th. According to a new report, the Surface Pro will be available for purchase in Hong Kong on May 17th. This detail was uncovered via an announcement on Microsoft's official Hong Kong website. As part of the launch, there will be an event at the Windsor House. Microsoft is also offering a promotion where the first 150 customers to purchase a Surface Pro in Hong Kong will receive gifts such as a Touch Cover, Wedge Touch mouse, and Office 365 subscriptions. As for pricing, the Surface Pro will run for HK $7,088 (US $913) for the 64GB model, and HK $7,888 (US $1016) for the 128GB model. The Surface Pro is already available on the mainland of China, while countries like Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, and Thailand are set to receive the Surface Pro by the end of June. As promised, Microsoft is releasing the Surface Pro to more markets around the globe. If you are wondering why your country has yet to receive the Surface Pro, Microsoft is making sure that there are plenty of devices in place for consumers to purchase.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368446742093</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 08:05:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368449404586-6</Id><Topic><Title>Next Generation Windows 8 Tablets....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368368166984</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 10:16:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>weawee Windows 8 is coming out with SP-1 (Windows Blue) in a few weeks- Windows 9 will be an even greater OS when it arrives- tough titty as they say</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368449404586</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 08:50:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368449533198-7</Id><Topic><Title>Android Malware On Google Play Downloads Spyware To Monitor Texts, Call Logs, Location (Source Mobile &amp;Apps)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368408265577</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 21:24:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL and of course there has never been ANY malware on Windows.

Currently MSFT has 20% market share with Amazon 75% and 5% by others; but what is interesting, according to Forrester Research Group is that MSFT will grow its market share much faster than the overall market growth.... For 2013 they predict, MSFT to grow by 75% and double each year till 2017.... SO for 2013 they expect our Azure revenues go to $1.75 billion from $1 billion in 2012, and double each year thereafter.... AT this rate we will be leaving Amazon with a small portion of the Cloud business as last month alone we signed up 10,000 new customers worldwide.

Quoting: "IT is under pressure to build private clouds, which means creating a data center architecture that can deliver the same kind flexible, scalable computing as public clouds from Amazon Web Services and other providers. And private clouds do so without the security and control worries that come with sending data outside a company's own walls. "However, with private clouds IT professionals face a dilemma between two competing goals: They want to build private clouds that are open to other clouds but also can run existing in-house systems and applications. Private clouds must be as open and standard as possible so, if necessary, you can shift workloads out to public clouds at times of peak demand (known as cloudbursting). Many IT pros look to OpenStack and other open source code that's based as much as possible on Web standards and nonproprietary languages, such as Python."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368452790930</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:46:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368453132061-22</Id><Title>ValueAct: Microsoft Could Potentially Become The World’s Largest Company....</Title><Msg>That is why ValueAct put $2 billion on MSFT....

Of course targeting any one group is inappropriate, this time done by some desk under the Bush IRS head, and the President said so, not appropriate. The IRS apologized. Not Enough for the Tea Party, it is fodder for a new Obama story. They never even listen to Obama, yet take him to task unfairly, single him out. So very odd. I guarantee if the targeting had been on a democrat group, the outrage would have been toward the group as tax cheats, heard non-stop 24/7 on faux news until the gullible viewers starrt to believe the lies.

But What Is It?</Title><Msg>Google it. Quoting: "Last week, Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc. quietly turned one year old. The birthday passed without fanfare, but next week, Microsoft plans to host a birthday party at its Silicon Valley campus. "Microsoft Open Technologies is a bit of an odd duck: It’s an independent subsidiary set up to push open source efforts by the world’s most famous proprietary software company. When it was announced, it left more than a few people — ourselves included — scratching their heads. "After all, Microsoft had already set up another entity — an independent nonprofit organization called the Outercurve Foundation — to manage open source efforts. "The difference is that although the Outercurve Foundation is funded by Microsoft, it’s governed by its own rules. And according to the foundation’s executive director, Paula Hunter, more than half of Outercurve’s projects are led by people outside of Microsoft. "Open Technologies is run by Microsoft. So, the company gets more control — a concept that’s not exactly simpatico with the open source way — and more credit for the software that it releases." .... "To date, Open Technologies has hosted a number of projects that help people who use Azure, Microsoft’s competitor to Amazon Web Services. Azure is a way for developers and businesses to build and run all sorts of software, and Microsoft realizes that these folks rely heavily on open source technologies. "But that doesn’t mean that Microsoft is becoming an open-source company. "Phil Haack, an ex-Microsoftie who’s n[o]w a developer at open-source developer tool vendor GitHub, says the Microsoft subsidiary doesn’t mean much unless it really works to open source core Microsoft software, something that would ultimately improve them and the way they work with other software. Open Technologies will only be a success, he says, if helps Microsoft open source Windows and Office."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368458227158</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 11:17:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368458883520-47</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft’s Open Source Company Is a Year Old.

If none of Microsoft's growth initiative amount to much-if the new Xbox fails to impress, if Windows tablets never gain much market share, in the Windows Phone remains an also-ran, etc.-then Microsoft is still attractive as a cheap dividend payer with a massive hoard of cash and stable, if gently declining, businesses in operating systems, servers, and office productivity software.

They think it’s their job, and lounging on the Oval Office couches, they nod along with the president’s every musing. But this presidency has taken OOCS to new heights. Mr. Obama has only a few trusted aides, and occasional leaks from the West Wing show a paranoid president suspicious of nearly everyone around him. Supremely confident, convinced by the fawning minions at his feet that he is untouchable, the president dismisses all controversy as partisan attacks by an overzealous opposition. A pliant press corps of stenographers follows in lockstep. Not surprisingly, every president in the past 60 years has had a major scandal in Term 2: Dwight Eisenhower had the U-2 “incident”; Richard Nixon had Watergate; Ronald Reagan had Iran-Contra; Bill Clinton had Monica (literally); George W. Bush had Katrina (and let’s not forget those WMDs that never turned up); and now, this president has Benghazi. Make no mistake: Benghazi is a major scandal. Benghazi is a scandal before, during and after the terrorist attack that left four Americas dead, including an ambassador. For months before, there were warnings about weak security at the U.S. Consulate in Libya; no one paid attention. During the attack, when Americans were begging for help, the White House ignored their pleas, sent no help. And after? That’s when the Obama scandal falls into the predictable second-term pattern his predecessors all learned the very hard way. Faced with a crisis, the Obama White House panicked. “We can’t have a terrorist strike two months before Election Day, so … let’s not have a terrorist strike two months before Election Day.” Cue the Cover-Up. washingtontimes</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368464750099</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:05:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368465042152-75</Id><Topic><Title>Android Malware On Google Play Downloads Spyware To Monitor Texts, Call Logs, Location (Source Mobile &amp;Apps)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368408265577</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 21:24:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>where cioppino? dead fish not float? :haha: :haha:</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368465042152</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:10:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368465526160-76</Id><Title>They won't believe Obama's certified birth</Title><Msg>certificate, and want his school records, even though no President has never had to do that.

Recent reports have indicated that the company is aiming to launch its own smartphone later this year sporting the latest version of Windows Phone 8 that will be released as part of "Windows Blue". But Myerson indicated that Microsoft has no immediate plans for a branded phone unless there's something the Redmond company can specifically provide. "It would have to be something where Nokia or HTC or other primary partners were not providing the consumer experience we think was possible on our platform," he said. But current Windows Phones provide the ideal experience, he said, so there's no need for Microsoft to jump into the smartphone arena and produce its own device.</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368466813010</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368467233614-82</Id><Topic><Title>100 million iPad owners are "frustrated" as they can NOT use MSFT Office....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368455117441</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:25:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ms office app avail. for both ipad and android. go to cloudon web page or go to either app store for free download.</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368467233614</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:47:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368467360934-83</Id><Topic><Title>100 million iPad owners are "frustrated" as they can NOT use MSFT Office....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368455117441</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 10:25:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Noodles you idiot you should read the access agreement, it is a scam and huge security risk and no major corporation will allow its people touch that junk.

There was talk of all the major internet players cooperating to build a unified web including cloud. All the big players, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple &amp; Google all agreed that the web should move towards HTML5. That has sort of moved in a half way backwards manner. It seems everyone is mad at each other, competing like mad and some tried things and dropped html5. Facebook converted to html 5 only to hate it and it was slow and sluggish and generally not working right. They dropped it and went backwards. Everyone has seen and knows what is going on between all these companies. The main thing they do is in the cloud. Yes, Linux is supported in the cloud and Microsoft has embraced all platforms. This is not the same situation with Windows 8 Phone or Windows 8. That is a closed system. You cannot build an app in Linux and install Malware and get it on Windows Phone. Windows 8 phone support html/Java &amp; Xaml. You can use all the programming languages like C#, etc. as the code behind. Programmers have more flexibility to write Windows 8 apps by using a language they already know as the code behind and just learn XAML for the design elements. This company of Microsoft tries to play nice with everyone even though in the real world it looks like a battle now. The open source you are referring to is for Open Source Cloud standards just as everyone at least tried for html5 though it seems like a war of everyone trying to keep to themselves to me.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368471994231</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 15:06:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368472034987-113</Id><Topic><Title>BitNami Brings Open Source Apps to Windows Azure Infrastructure Services....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367700992511</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 16:56:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BitNami is smart since Microsoft will own 75% of the public cloud market and will give them great exposure.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1368472034987</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 15:07:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368472110951-114</Id><Topic><Title>ValueAct: Microsoft Could Potentially Become The World’s Largest Company....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368453132061</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:52:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazing rate of growth.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1368472110951</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 15:08:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368472149839-115</Id><Topic><Title>They won't believe Obama's certified birth</Title><Username>ghosanonon</Username><Timestamp>1368465526160</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 13:18:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Show any proof of what you say, show Bush's transcripts.

Ben's money printing by keeping mortgages low is helping work through this boat anchor on the rest of the economy. He's not going to change. The good news for the U.S. economy is that the rest of the world is now also printing money, even the Japanese, because of the entire global retraction (deflation). Bernanke is doing a fantastic job. He will know when to end to monetary easing and that will only happen when the housing market is back to where a smaller percentage of homeowners are under water and housing prices is higher than it still is. Knowing that is enough to plan your investments for at least one year. Gold is only going to drop further over the long run. It may have little spike here and there with some international events, but it's going to $1,000 and possibly to $800 within the next two years. Investors that watched Fox News bought into the "buy gold because there's going to be inflation" fable and worse, they missed the entire market rally and are sitting on the sidelines. Lesson: Never watch ideological "news" programs (right or left) when you are investor. Fox did a great disservice to its audience these last years and cost them a bundle. I know. My friends who drank the Fox Cool-Aid are stuck with gold and missed the market rally. Hating President Obama is emotion and emotion has no place in investing.</Msg><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1368477217542</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 16:33:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368478872749-141</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT valuation....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367458331128</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 21:32:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes I agree.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1368478872749</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 17:01:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368479154741-142</Id><Title>Today's Trade....</Title><Msg>So folks we opened near the Day's lows and closed near the Day's highs in a low volume day and down day in the DOW....

It's not just the U.S Fed that is printing money, almost everyone is, so this bodes better for the U.S. than if Bernanke was doing it alone. Now the Japanese are doing it at a faster pace than we are. I'd never believed I'd live to see that. Whether the victory is "hollow" or not, it is a victory. My portfolio is up at the greatest point in my 30 year investing career. Investors should never buy into political ideology from the right or left. Those who made money on gold were those who bought during/immediately after the financial collapse of 2008. The gold rally ended in 2010 and it's been a slide ever since as the entire world is in a deflationary contraction. Gold is toxic at this point. I agree with you that the "party" will end at some point for equities, but I'm with Warren Buffett, it's got a long way to still go before that happens. Those who missed this rally can still get in on some of it, but there will come a point where it will end as all cycles do, but not soon. And there is no housing bubble yet. That's got another 18-24 months of sorting out still to go. So, in the meantime, here's hoping you can make some money within the economic reality of our time which is what good investors do. And I truly do feel sorry for my friends who bought into the "inflation is coming" drumbeat by Neil Cavuto and Sean Hannity and the Fox "News" programs. They bought gold and missed the rally completely all because they "hated" President Obama. I'm just an investor. I don't drag politics into my investing. Watch Bloomberg if any financial television. Otherwise, always do your own research.</Msg><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1368483244083</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 18:14:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368483461844-153</Id><Topic><Title>Today's Trade....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368479154741</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 17:05:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>THE Volume was 2,709,925 contracts with 98.4% Calls....

Demand for long calls is nothing new for the software giant; in the last 10 days, calls have been purchased to open at a pace of nearly 3-to-2 over their put counterparts. In yesterday's trading, the June 33 call was in focus. More than 17,500 contracts changed hands, almost 90% of which translated as new open interest overnight. The majority of the volume traded at the ask price and implied volatility rose by just shy of 1 percentage point. In short, it looks as though these opening call orders were initiated on the buy side. During the last two weeks, open interest at this near-the-money strike has expanded by almost 36,000 to 76,431. It is now neck-and-neck with the June 32 call strike as home to the heaviest call open interest in the back-month series.

The records obtained by the Justice Department listed incoming and outgoing calls, and the duration of each call, for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and the main number for AP reporters in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. In all, the government seized those records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012. The exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown but more than 100 journalists work in the offices whose phone records were targeted on a wide array of stories about government and other matters. In a letter of protest sent to Attorney General Eric Holder Monday, AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation. He demanded the return of the phone records and the destruction of all copies. "There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters. These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP's newsgathering operations, and disclose information about AP's activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know," Pruitt said. The government would not say why it sought the records</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368494315745</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 21:18:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368494852999-181</Id><Topic><Title>The Articles of Impeachmment (count 3 IIRC) specified abuse of the power of the IRS to target</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368484014539</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 18:26:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It was article 2 actually.

The AP said the Justice Department secretly seized two months of reporters’ and editors’ telephone records without explanation in April and May 2012. In the AP’s report on the scandal, President and CEO Gary Pruitt called the Justice Department’s move “a massive and unprecedented intrusion” into how news organizations gather the news. Pruitt wrote a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder demanding the records and all copies be returned. According to the AP, “News organizations normally are notified ahead of time that the government wants phone records and enter into negotiations over the requested information. In this case, however, the government, in its letter to the AP, cited an exemption to those rules that holds that prior notification can be waived if such notice, in the exemption’s wording, might ‘pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation.’” More than 100 journalists who report on government and other matters work in offices the administration targeted. While Justice Department rules call for subpoenas of news records to be approved by Holder, it’s unclear whether he ordered the action.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1368495179022</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 21:32:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368496273965-184</Id><Topic><Title>Obama says all the hoopla about Benghazi is a side show, just tell us who told Rice to lie</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368491937596</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 20:38:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i say....David Axelrod....(Obama's senior campaign advisor)....and good buddy....and Valerie Jarrett....(i call her ....Obama's other wife)....also very close...thats my take....you heard it from Trendpicker first....for future reference....nobody heard this one anywhere....wait....</Msg><Username>trendpicker</Username><Timestamp>1368496273965</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 21:51:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368496519252-185</Id><Title>Scandal politics grip Washington</Title><Msg>What would one expect when the most corrupt administration in American history is at the helm?
