Facts aren't things you theorize, or embellish with your opinion. A lot of the homes lost were owned by greedy investors who got caught at the end of the run. They were buying homes by the dozen on lies about their income on the applications. Others got rich, very rich, in the years just before, the last missed the boat. Sound familiar to you?

About 32% of global information workers said they would like to use the Microsoft Windows operating system for their next work tablet, according to a new survey by Forrester Research Inc. That translates to about 200 million global information workers who may be receptive to Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablet. Microsoft really needs the Surface Pro to be successful among workers. The company is facing a decline in sales of PCs running Windows operating system amid the growing popularity of Apple ’s iPad and Samsung Electronics Co. ’s Galaxy Tab tablets. So far, early adoption of Microsoft Surface seems slower than that of the iPad. Microsoft is positioning the Surface Pro with its Windows 8 operating system as a more business-friendly tablet alternative to Apple Inc.’s iPad. The Surface Pro can run popular Microsoft office productivity and application development tools and interoperate with other applications businesses used to manage sales contacts or their supply chains. Microsoft has even indicated that the Surface Pro could replace some laptops. While this may be attractive to CIOs because most companies already have Windows-compatible applications, the idea of Surface Pro replacing laptops may not be a practicable solution in the near term because it’s simply too difficult to give workers all the other apps they need to do their jobs. “The idea that I can take a laptop away from an employee and give them a tablet is a fantasy,” said Ted Schadler, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research. A separate survey from Internet market research firm Net Applications gives the Windows 8 just a 2.2% share of the PC operating system market. But Forrester’s survey shows the Surface could make a difference for Microsoft. “It’s not game over for Microsoft,” said Mr. Schadler, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester Research. He noted, however, that the survey of nearly 10,000 information workers was done before Microsoft Surface launched. Still, if Forrester’s survey is accurate, workers may just be willing to give Surface Pro a try.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1359997620843</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 12:07:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359997833824-35</Id><Topic><Title>Linux Eliminated at DELL</Title><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1359983918048</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 08:18:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Although I am somewhat ambivalent on this, overall it's about time MSFT reached a deal with Dell.</Msg><Username>investment925</Username><Timestamp>1359997833824</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 12:10:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359998256116-36</Id><Title>Ballmer giving everyone in the world the bird again</Title><Msg>Now you need server upgrades to run office.

IRS regulations issued Wednesday failed to fix the problem as liberal backers of the president's plan had hoped. As a result, some families that can't afford the employer coverage that they are offered on the job will not be able to get financial assistance from the government to buy private health insurance on their own. How many people will be affected is unclear. The Obama administration says its hands were tied by the way Congress wrote the law. Officials said the administration tried to mitigate the impact. Families that can't get coverage because of the glitch will not face a tax penalty for remaining uninsured, the IRS rules said.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1360011872860</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:04:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360013546440-59</Id><Title>IRS now says cost to average families for Obamacare is $20,000 a year - yikes</Title><Msg>News Flash:Participating in ObamaCare will cost the average American family at least $20,000 per year! The IRS (which is charged with enforcing the onerous penalties and fines of the President’s healthcare “reform” law) has finally released a cost analysis based on ObamaCare regulations showing that the cheapest healthcare plan in 2016 will cost average American families of four or five members $20,000 per year for the so-called “bronze plan.” CNSNews . c * m is reporting… “The annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) is $20,000,” the IRS statement says. “Under Obamacare, Americans will be required to buy health insurance or pay a penalty to the IRS.” So, your choice is to buy the bronze plan (or another more expensive plan) – or pay the IRS a penalty for being uninsured. But wait, there’s more… Under the IRS enforcement of the ObamaCare regulations, an uninsured child or dependent spouse will also trigger an IRS fine. CNSNews . c * m: “A parent will be held liable for ObamaCare’s individual mandate penalty if they don’t have insurance coverage for their children.” ObamaCare’s official name, the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” is quickly becoming the punch line of a pathetic federal joke at the expense of the American people! Sadly, this is just the beginning of the ObamaCare plague. The outbreak of ObamaCare regulations has only just begun. As we have warned would happen continually for four years now, American citizens are shocked by what is finally becoming clear to them… According to a recent Gallup report, many employers just aren’t hiring, and sixty-one percent of America’s small business owners cite “the potential cost of healthcare” as a major influence on their hiring decisions. Many unions, once champions in pushing for ObamaCare, are now having second thoughts about the impact on their members and the shrinking benefit packages employers can afford.
