MILLER Post Correspondents Last Updated: 7:53 AM, September 4, 2012 Posted: 1:20 AM, September 4, 2012 CHARLOTTE, NC — Democrats are cringing over the latest Bubba brouhaha, but so far, they’re giving Bill Clinton a pass for his newly revealed 2008 comment that “a few years ago, this guy [Barack Obama] would have been carrying our bags.” “It’s offensive. You’re calling on a black man to carry your bags,” fumed delegate Sylvia Moore-Russell, a native New Yorker who moved to Charlotte. “Bill Clinton is a loose cannon,” she said. “We sometimes give him too much of a pass. But what are we going to do, sweep Bill under the rug? There’s too much dirt.” She said that now, before Clinton’s big speech tomorrow at the Democratic National Convention, “would be a nice time for him to apologize” for the racially insensitive remark he allegedly made about Obama in a conversation with the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Clinton allegedly made it while trying to convince Kennedy to endorse his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in the bitter battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to The New Yorker magazine. Kennedy nevertheless endorsed Obama. Clinton’s “bags” remark sent shock waves through the Charlotte convention, as delegates and Democratic big shots labored to find an excuse for him. “We all say things we may regret in the heat of political battle,” said Barry Hobbins, Maine’s Senate minority leader and a convention delegate. New York state Sen. Ruth Hassell-Thompson, of Westchester, decried Clinton’s alleged remark for being “in very poor taste.” “But that was then. This is now,” she backpedaled. “Bill Clinton’s number-one goal is for Democrats to win the White House.” The Clinton camp bristled at questions about the racially charged comment. “That’s a two-year old (false) story recycled and sourced to someone NOT ALIVE, are you actually asking me that?” blasted Clinton spokesman Matt McKenna in an e-mail to The Post. “And because you work for the Post, I have to say this: I don’t have anything for you on the record.” President Obama publicly ignored the controversy and instead focused his wrath on Mitt Romney. Obama blitzed Romney with a series of gridiron gibes during a campaign stop in football-crazy Ohio, saying, if elected, the Republican nominee would guide the nation to a “losing season.” Obama told union workers in Toledo that Romney’s tax plan “sounds like unnecessary roughness” against the middle class. He later traveled to Louisiana to view recovery efforts after Hurricane Isaac. Republicans weren’t clearing the field for the Democrats in North Carolina, where a new Charlotte Observer/Elon University poll shows Romney with a 47-43 lead in the battleground state. Romney running mate Paul, Ryan arrived in North Carolina yesterday to counter the Dems, and delivered an unflattering comparison between Obama and former President Jimmy Carter. “Simply put, the Jimmy Carter years look like the good old days compared to where we are right now,” Ryan said.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346764457440</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:14:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346764702582-17</Id><Title>NOKIA--MICROSOFT Alliance?</Title><Msg>What will likely come out tomorrow during the joint conference?</Msg><Username>cameron12x</Username><Timestamp>1346764702582</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:18:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346764826784-18</Id><Topic><Title>Only took 41 month to pile up $ 6 Trillion in Obamanure!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346732347072</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 00:19:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama’s Emergency Phone Call to 'Harold and Kumar' Stars by Joy Lin | September 03, 2012 151 Comments It's hardly a conventional way to promote a serious convention speech, but the Obama for America campaign has called up comedic relief to court the youth vote: the stars of the stoner cult classic 'Harold and Kumar.' In an effort to promote their 8 p.m. livestream from the convention on Thursday, to be hosted by actor and former White House Office of Public Engagement Associate Director Kal Penn, the campaign has released a promotional web video opening with a scene of a very-serious President Obama picking up the phone. "Hey, this is Barack," the president says as suspenseful music plays in the background. "Listen I need to know if you're on board. Okay, good. Cause I'm counting on you, everybody is. We have to get this right. So there's a lot at stake here. Just remember that I'm trusting you on this and I'll see you there." Cut to a picture straight out of a comedy set: actors Penn and John Cho sitting on a couch with a cardboard pizza box in front of them. Cho asks, "Who was that? Sounded intense." Penn responds, nonchalantly, "The president." "Sweet," Cho responds, chomping on a cheese doodle. A cartoonish sound erupts from the television and they burst out laughing like college frat boys on a weekday night. On Monday, Penn was spotted getting ready to interview first lady Michelle Obama at the Charlotte convention. The DNC is livestreaming the entire convention, and has teased that they will interview special guests online, including Marc Anthony, Elizabeth Banks, Aisha Tyler, Olivia Wilde, Fran Drescher, Zach Braff and Alexis Bledel.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1346764826784</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:20:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346764869935-19</Id><Title>Democrat Platform: Kill your babies; Steal your parents Medicare Money; Celebrate Perversion</Title><Msg>Obama and other Democrats: Far more dangerous to America's well being and civilization than Al Quaida.</Msg><Username>reasonableme53</Username><Timestamp>1346764869935</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:21:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346765610296-20</Id><Topic><Title>Reverse Racism: Obama: Isaac help is on the way.</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1346751299339</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 05:34:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>banned Havvfeeces is a piece of work isn't he.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1346765610296</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:33:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346765625978-21</Id><Title>Dubya Fly-Over After Katrina vs Obama Coordinated effort</Title><Msg>Obama was accompanied by Republican Louisiana Gov.

Bush, which were widely viewed as a failure. “In the past we sometimes haven’t seen the kind of coordination needed for these kinds of disasters,” Obama said. But he also emphasized that this type of natural disaster transcends political labels. “When disasters like this happen we set aside whatever petty disagreements we might have,” Obama said. “Nobody’s a Democrat or a Republican.”</Msg><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1346765625978</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:33:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346766293526-22</Id><Topic><Title>12 Years Bush Tax Cuts &amp; Unfunded Wars = 12T Debt</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1346763962305</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:06:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mow, the current tax cuts are all Bush, you like it or not, say it or not.

According to a survey by The Hill, 52 percent of voters say that the nation is in worse shape than it was in September of 2008. That's compared with 31 percent of voters who believe the nation is in better shape, while 15 percent say "about the same." The poll also finds that 54 percent of likely voters say that Obama does not deserve reelection based on his job performance, while 50 percent called themselves "very unsatisfied" with Obama's handling of the economy. Obama surrogates have struggled this week to answer the basic question about whether the majority of Americans are better off than they were four years ago. On Sunday, several Obama advisers hesitated to say that conditions have improved in four years time — prompting a Republican pile on and a full scale retreat by Democrats on Monday. But the poll points to the fact that this is an electorate deeply dissatisfied with the status quo. The Hill surveyed 1,000 likely voters giving the poll a 3 percentage point margin of error.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346769394747</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 10:36:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346769719146-38</Id><Title>LETS FACE IT: MITT ROMNEY SUCKS</Title><Msg>Who ever vote for Romney/Ryan must be an idiot who will buy any trash somebody gives him.</Msg><Username>cohenjoe31</Username><Timestamp>1346769719146</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 10:41:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346769905197-39</Id><Title>Let's say, RW jeanyisses, 1% pay 99%</Title><Msg>of the taxes.

The Obama campaign have been working desperately to ensure that the 74,000-seater Bank of America stadium in Charlotte would be filled.

Now, it looks like the weather has come to the President's rescue. As officials prepare to open the Democratic convention this afternoon, there are strong indications that the speech will be moved to Time Warner Cable Arena, which has a capacity of just over 20,000.

Further more, Romney pays people to do his tax work because it saves him more money than it costs to do and find the tax savings. Those people he employs have earned income and they pay taxes. His taxes and theirs are all related to his income. I think we can agree on that -- but Romney only reports HIS taxes paid by himself and not those he employs.</Msg><Username>oldexbanker</Username><Timestamp>1346788121190</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 15:48:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346788492616-70</Id><Topic><Title>Do You Want Another Dubya For President?</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1346767015681</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 09:56:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tomuch, I would like to verify your "who are the ones invested in Bain offshore?

A A | Email Us | Print | Forward Article 0 inShare A record number of Muslim delegates are attending this year’s Democratic National Convention, according to the Council on American-Islamic Relations. An estimated 100 Muslim delegates from 20 different states are in Charlotte, the group said in a press release, which pointed out that only a “handful” of delegates attended the Republican National Convention last week in Tampa, “during which the RNC adopted a platform plank targeting the religious practices of Muslims,” the group’s press release said. There were 43 Muslim and Arab-American delegates at the DNC in 2008 and 25 in 2004, according to CAIR. "The more than doubling of Muslim delegates at this year's Democratic National Convention is a direct result of their hard work and grassroots organizing within the Democratic Party," CAIR Government Affairs Coordinator Robert McCaw said in the press release. "It is also a sign of the American Muslim community's growing civic engagement and acceptance in the Democratic Party." CAIR is America's largest Muslim civil liberties and advocacy organization.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1346811948364</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-04 22:25:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346811959891-107</Id><Topic><Title>Like Barrack, Michelle never worked for private sector.
