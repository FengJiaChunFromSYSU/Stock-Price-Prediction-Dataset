Instead, they want to start a war with China over the Taiwan issue as a way of not repaying the Chinese debt. By stunting manufacturing in USA, Republican Anglosaxons have made the US dollar a WORTHLESS piece of paper, hyped beyond its value.

Yes, the D min E vill Musllim is quite serious and quite insane just as his hero Hit ler was. Now you know why Hussein called Americans "his enemy" in that Latino radio show interview. Don't forget, there were some good German people and they were too afraid to stand up and say something for fear of reprisal from their German "Messiah" of the time. That's the problem, liberals make demigods out of their leaders and delusionally worship them as their Messiahs while conservatives just want someone who can do the job and suffer the consequences if they screw up and in the liberal's eyes their "Messiahs" can DO NO WRONG. Ps. Don't be a sheep, stand up and speak, stand up against the eve ill one that calls Americans his "enemy" and to take "revenge" against them,... vote the Musllim out of the white house or he will have you stepping into the buildings with "Showers" signs above the doors.

The old economy, on the defensive, is centralized and reliant on banks, commodities and fossil fuels. Romney and the Republicans are its rear guard. Party Hypocrisy Also reflected on the map are contradictions in the Tea Party movement, through whose portals Romney had to pass on his way to the Republican nomination. It says it favors a small federal government, but supports federal pre-emption of state food-safety laws and environmental regulations. It backs cushy state-tax breaks for new factories -- until those factories produce wind turbines, solar panels or fuel cells. It favors taxing consumption, not incomes -- until the consumption being taxed is fossil fuels. The Republicans are united. They have mortgaged both their electoral arithmetic and their financial base to the incumbent economy, even as it loses competitiveness. (Established, but retrenching, industries are the most generous campaign donors. They have the most to gain from government protection against their challengers.)</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1352122049872</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 08:27:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352125477964-23</Id><Topic><Title>The Kenyan doesn't just kill jobs</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1352119173010</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 07:39:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tocrazy- that was bush fault that the marines killed OSB.</Msg><Username>tomuch2491</Username><Timestamp>1352125477964</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 09:24:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352126767991-24</Id><Topic><Title>That was terrorist mooooslims</Title><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1352097027649</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 01:30:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Norquist's, who all tea terds bow down to, wife is Muslim.

(CBS Atlanta) – If you’re one of many who are currently unemployed, you may be in luck. According to the Atlanta Business Chronicle, one area real estate company is willing to invest thousands to create new job opportunities. However, there is a catch. Frank Duffy of Duffy Realty says he will only create the jobs if Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney wins this Tuesday’s election. “It’s about a $50,000 investment that we’re willing to make on these new agents,” Duffy told WGCL-TV. “It’ll only happen if there’s a Republican in the White House after Wednesday. If there’s a President-Elect Romney, we’re willing to make that investment.” Some jobs will still open up at Duffy Realty even if current President Barack Obama is re-elected, though it will not amount to the reported 100 openings Duffy would potentially bankroll if Romney wins. “I’m not willing to take that $50,000 out of my cash to make that investment,” Duffy added to the station. “I will hire agents piecemeal, five, six, seven, eight at a time, but I’m not going to make the investment going out on a limb to help the unemployed … start their life over.” He reportedly supports Romney because he feels he’ll be better for small business. Despite his choice in candidate, however, Duffy did tell admit to WGCL-TV that his company has succeeded during President Obama’s time in office.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1352129579062</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 10:32:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352130022614-28</Id><Topic><Title>Romney has used car salesman skills, the president has no skills!!!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1352076237448</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-04 19:43:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This country is in trouble if you think that.

To watch the deficit increase, and then see Republican lawmakers sign a pledge to an unelected official to never raise taxes on the wealthy is an outrage. People are going to see their Social Security, and Mesicare cut back to pay for more tax cuts for billionaires, and millionaires , it's sick..When Eisenhower was president, the tax rate on the obscenely wealthy was 90 %. In his second inaugural address, Franklin Roosevelt said "The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much, it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little." Now we are faced with a complete contradiction of that philosophy that served our country so well. Now our political leaders are falling all over themselves to make the rich richer, and the poor poorer. We see the manifestation of the philosophy of greed every day. Sports stars quibbling about whether they will sign a contract to play a game for 200 million, or 300 million. These same stars in some cases charging youngsters for an autograph, and the rest of us paying a share in advertising fees. We see it in the pay CEOs who make hundreds of millions of dollars per year , while the employees for the same company make only a tiny fraction of the CEO pay. We see it in the political arena when political leaders in some cases, own stock of companies who are doing business in war zones at huge profit.. Roosevelt wanted to save capitalism, but he was having a hard time doing it. Even the capitalists of the time, didn't seem to appreciate the potential threat to the system that served them so well.. Some have speculated that If it were not for the second world war, capitalism may well not have survived.

Consumers are spending more and saving less after reducing household debt to the lowest since 2003. Home prices are rebounding after falling more than 30 percent from their 2006 highs. And banks are increasing lending after boosting equity capital by more than $300 billion since 2009. “The die is cast for a much stronger recovery,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist in West Chester, Pennsylvania, for Moody’s Analytics Inc. He sees growth this year and next at about 2 percent before doubling to around 4 percent in both 2014 and 2015 as consumption, construction and hiring all pick up.

HOUSTON, TX - Friday afternoon at an early polling place located at 6719 W. Montgomery Road in Houston, NAACP members were seen advocating for President Barack Obama according to volunteer poll watchers on location at the time. According to Eve Rockford, a poll watcher trained by voter integrity group True the Vote, three NAACP members showed up to the 139 precinct location with 50 cases of bottled water and began handing bottles out to people standing in line. While wearing NAACP labeled clothing, members were "stirring the crowd" and talking to voters about flying to Ohio to promote President Barack Obama. After watching what was occurring, Rockford approached Polling Supervisor Rose Cochran about what she was seeing. "I went to the polling supervisor and let her know that it was not appropriate that they were in the building handing out water. She ignored me. I repeated my statement. She told me that she would handle it. She did nothing. I then went to the assistant supervisor and he stood up, walked over to another table and then sat down. I then walked into the waiting room and they were reloading another dolly with more cases of water," Rockford said in a True the Vote incident report. After handing out water and advocating for President Obama, the NAACP members started handpicking and moving people to the front of a long voting line inside the polling place according to the incident report. After multiple complaints from voters about the line cutting, Rockford received a phone call from downtown telling her to “stand down.” “All of the sudden one of the clerks, Dayan Cohen, said that someone wanted to speak to me on the phone. It was someone from downtown. I got on the phone and she said she was from downtown and that I needed to stand down and that it was okay for the NAACP to be within 100 ft. and they could hand out water. I told her that the NAACP was inside the building, wearing the NAACP clothing and caps and were handing out water and moving people from the back of the lines to the front of the lines,” Rockford said. At this point, NAACP members were instructed to turn their clothing inside out, which they refused to do and said they weren’t going to stop their actions inside the polling place. Their behavior and actions to move people to the front of the line continued for the rest of the evening. Texas State Representative Sylvester Turner, a former Texas NAACP leader, was also seen outside the building talking with voters. “The NAACP basically ran this poll location and the judges did nothing about it,” Rockford said.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1352142589542</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 14:09:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352142657404-54</Id><Topic><Title>Why Romney Will Win</Title><Username>plmartin_2012</Username><Timestamp>1352128655677</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-05 10:17:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks.
