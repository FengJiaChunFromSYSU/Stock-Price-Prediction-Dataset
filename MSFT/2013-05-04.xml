Quoting from the researchers' paper: "Polymorphic attacks have long been a plague for traditional desktop and server systems. While there exist earlier studies on the effectiveness of anti-malware tools on PCs [4], our domain of study is different in that we exclusively focus on mobile devices like smartphones that require different ways for anti-malware design." In other words, everything they say about Android is equally true of Windows. The only difference is that for this study, they chose to concentrate on a mobile system, precisely because it has become so commercially important recently.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367649050643</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 02:30:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367649571307-14</Id><Topic><Title>Android fatal security flaws....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367633671515</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 22:14:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In summary, ossobucco has been shown, over and over, to be a liar, using specious arguments to attack Android and other non-Microsoft software falsely.

I agree. With 8 billion shares out, and a bunch of new holders where is the risk? Low volume gains are like a stacking block game, can you put another piece on the stack and not have it fall, yeah maybe, but it takes little to create the cascade. Think of volume and backing and filling as the foundation of the structure. While MSFT may be better founded than many today, and a better value, the overall market is indeed a house of cards and MSFT will have a rough time if that house crashes.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367669583195</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 08:13:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367671483597-19</Id><Topic><Title>Android fatal security flaws....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367633671515</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 22:14:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think if they looked deeper into Trend Micro and ex engineers they would have some leads. I also think that stories like the one that 36 entire countries were subjected to fake Mozilla Firefox software that was spyware according to Mozilla shows the problem. I heard about this because Mozilla sued to the company. What about reporting it to law enforcement? What about helping the people who's systems were compromised? It appears that the majority of the problems are swept under the rug because it is easier and cheaper than dealing with the FBI etc. If the real amount of problems were know it would be scary. Android devices were approved to be allowed into DOD bld. like the Pentagon this week. They have to have Knox on them. It is hard to get a clear answer from Google on if these devices, which devices and when they will all be safe for DOD blds. Google last said there will be a delay. It looks really bad., DOD It staff has the authority to enter those device remotely at any time. I wonder what this is going to do bringing the malware problem out in the open of Android devices. If Google cannot stop it or security software cannot the OS should be scrapped. It is a cluster F with Android and no one knows which are infected with malware. They just know that a lot are like 65% of all Android. Is Windows Phone Safe, so far yes. When Microsoft finally releases it's own phone it will be much safer and clearer. I was using a Surface last night and was noticing how much smoother, faster and better everything worked compared to an Acer etc. You could feel it even in the fliks of the screen. The display looked deeper and clearer also. There are just little problems say with a touch pad on the devices that were not made by Microsoft that make all the difference. I for one cannot wait until Microsoft becomes a pure hardware play and makes their own phone, tablets and PC's.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1367671483597</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 08:44:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367672601746-20</Id><Topic><Title>Volume is low again today....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367608155990</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:09:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MSFT is moving up now like it hasn't in ages.

Gunshops must keep records for life, you gonna require an individual keep records for life? It's a good sounding slippery slope step on the path to, or at least needed for potential confiscation.

The total number of subscribers is now over 46 million worldwide. Additionally, the entertainment and devices division posted revenue of $2.53 billion, which is up "56%" over last year. SO the $15.00 subscription for XBOX 720 will further balloon our earnings and if we decide to compete with Netflix, you can do the math.... IT is also worth noting that Electronic Arts will be producing the next few games (such as Respawn) as XBOX "exclusive" and that would be the real driving force for increasing our subscription base.

In the first installment, Microsoft introduces us to Philip De Rop, a Quality Assurance Manager at a supply chain software company. In the blog post, De Rop talks about his travels with his Apple iPad and how it gets in the way almost all the time. However, with Microsoft's Surface Pro, De Rop no longer needs his iPad and considers the Surface Pro a replacement to his laptop. "I no longer need my iPad, which saves up a tray at the customs at airports. My laptop bag became a lot lighter. Now people stare at me when I unpack the Surface. I see them think, how can he work using only that small tablet?" De Rop states. He emphasizes how the Surface Pro takes up little space, compared to the iPad which took up a lot of space, especially when traveling. De Rop also mentions how he can plug his Windows Phone into his Surface Pro charger, and charge both his smartphone and the device at the same time. Again, taking up little space. "I have hooked up two 24 inch screens through a Targus USB 3.0 Dual Video Docking Station. With my laptop, I had to close my lid and could not use the laptop screen. Now I even have access to the Surface Touch screen. A full size keyboard and mouse are linked to the docking station. Why would I ever need an iPad again?" De Rop adds.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367696580596</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 15:43:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367697122044-57</Id><Topic><Title>hawcreek why did you lose your hawcreek id and take out an_obama_nation</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1367692328941</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 14:32:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does it look like I lost my id moe?</Msg><Username>hawcreek2013</Username><Timestamp>1367697122044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 15:52:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367697596908-58</Id><Topic><Title>Congratulations all long term investors</Title><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1367612324567</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 16:18:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank You for the cordial reply, I get sick of putting OT political posters on Ignore only to have the same ones clone a new attention seeking alias.

The 521 is a T-Mobile-specific variant of the Lumia 520 that debuted at Mobile World Congress in February. It offers good-but-average hardware for the price (1 GHz dual-core processor, 4-inch touch screen, a 5-megapixel camera, 8G storage expandable to 64G).

Nope, I wish everyone could have everything they want. or need. I wish everyone could have the very best surgeon. Right now "the rich" pay twice the share they were paying when marginal rates were twice as high. Where I sit at the government table is inconsequential, we will run out of money and credit. It is no surprise the bleeding hearts wanting others to pay for everything are all fiscal morons like you.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367720679223</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 22:24:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367720935229-102</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft promotes Surface Pro with personal stories from owners: 'I no longer need my iPad'....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367696580596</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 15:43:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bought a new iPad Mini instead of a Surface Pro and saved $700!</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1367720935229</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 22:28:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367721026767-103</Id><Topic><Title>Gun owners will need to "Stand their Ground" because the radical left is focused</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367634656860</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 22:30:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PC owners stand their ground by NOT buying Windows 8 Metro!</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1367721026767</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 22:30:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367721141207-104</Id><Topic><Title>Brilliant idea:: Background checks to buy alcohol</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367691462358</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 14:17:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How about a psychiatric check for people who bought Windows 8?

Obama is proof of that and yet we are denied a meaningful background check on him. How did he pay for his college tuition and his living expenses? Where are his college records? What was his relationship to Bill Ayers? What went on in Rev. Wright's "church"? Where was he really born? Did his boyhood education in the madrassa make him a muslim for life? Why does he lie about having voted for infanticide when he was in the Illinois Senate? Just a start at a very long list background checks we should have.</Msg><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1367723813442</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 23:16:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367724137666-107</Id><Topic><Title>Acer Says Microsoft Could Catch Up to Google, Apple in Mobile (Source Bloomberg)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367604869239</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 14:14:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i just wondering. you say that start of selling even cheaper winpho than the others they sell is next signal. what was first one? how you know? you have special decoder to interpret meaning of walmart sale? it work for thing other than phone? :haha:</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367724137666</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 23:22:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367724781491-108</Id><Topic><Title>Walmart Will Start Selling Nokia's Dirt-Cheap Windows Phone Next Week (Source Business Insider)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367704581815</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 17:56:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you see video of sale of 520 phone by hsn on youtube? it here: youtubeFULLSTOPcom/watch?v=-dUOS8K8r0s they sell out in only 4 day? wow! at 0:30 into video he say they only have 400 unit! and they able to sell all in only 4 day!?!?!?!?!? :haha: so, where i find dirt cheap 520 at walmart? over by potting soil? near fertilizer? maybe some of it fertilizer you make before you become stewed veal? must be better than fertilizer you spreading here!</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367724781491</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-04 23:33:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
