Don't do anything to protect yourself or your family. Run or hide and call the police and wait 5-10 mins for them to come. Reality is some people cannot run, or cannot gather the family especially with small kids to run. The assertion that criminals are better shots is baseless - they are lazy by nature or messed up. One has the advantage when defending an area one knows vs. a criminal coming through a portal. The real advantage a criminal has is that law abiding citizens are disarmed and helpless because of non-effective gun control bills which are nothing more than political theater.</Msg><Username>xtromania</Username><Timestamp>1366443320269</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 03:35:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366443614612-6</Id><Title>Balmer Best CEO Ever</Title><Msg>Under leadership of Balmer revenue has doubled, MSFT have done buy back of billions of shares, and Earnings has doubled.

While the deal will be very lucrative for the software giant, it is bad news for Microsoft’s arch-rival and technology powerhouse Google. Under the deal, the details of which were not released, Microsoft will collect a royalty for each and every Smartphone, tablet and television Foxconn builds that runs Google’s Android or Chrome OS. The deal is a move by Hon Hai, which manufactures more than 40 percent of the world’s consumer electronics, to avoid breach of patent issues created by the two operating systems. While Microsoft is rolling in the dough from its intellectual property, Google, the creator of both platforms, will get nothing.

Benedict Evans’ look at the Nexus 10 sales number makes for interesting reading but his kicker at the end, that the Microsoft Surface devices were outselling the Nexus 10′s, caught my eye. When you look at the numbers, it tells an interesting story on Microsoft’s future in the tablet/laptop space. As with most consumer technology, actual sales figures are hard to come by, but with some lateral thinking and reading of analyst reports, it’s possible to come to an approximate number. And when you do that, you get the interesting result that Microsoft’s Surface tablets have outsold Google’s Nexus 10. The numbers: Nexus 10 numbers are from Evans, who takes the relatively unique screen size of the Nexus 10 tablet, identified as ‘x-large XHDPI’ in the development data that Google provides. Take these numbers, exclude China, and apply it equally to the Google Play user base (which Google now use for all their Android usage numbers) and Evans comes out with an initial figure, albeit with caveats, of 680,000 Nexus 10 tablets in use. Bloomberg’s call of 1.5 million Surface RT and Surface Pro devices is in line with many analysts, so let’s run with that number. Even allowing for some give and take in the calculations, Microsoft’s Surface is doing better than the Nexus 10. Now have Surface Pro on sale for a full quarter, and assume there will be some economies of scale and more efficiencies in the retail process over the year. If you wanted an early sign on how Microsoft was going to operate in the ‘post-PC’ era, you’ve got one here. Yes the volumes are low, and the Surface range is not as attractive as the iOS choices available. But if Microsoft can build up the sales of the Surface Pro in 2013 and reach four to five million unit sales a year, they will have a healthy income stream from their Surface range.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366492787397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 17:19:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366501860963-34</Id><Topic><Title>Win XP is outdated and all the IT industry has to upgrade to either Win7 or Win8.

There was a reason for using WIN-XP, otherwise these companies need not had to go for WIN XP. In other words, these companies will most likely or will only use WIN 7/8. Lot of applications that run on Windows eco system will not run on Linux, so they don't have choice to use Linux even if they wanted to use.</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1366501860963</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 19:51:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366501919039-35</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Surface Outsells The Nexus 10 And Points To Redmond's Post-PC Future (Source Forbes April 20/2013)</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366492787397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 17:19:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Excellent post.</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1366501919039</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 19:51:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366504194830-36</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Surface Outsells The Nexus 10 And Points To Redmond's Post-PC Future (Source Forbes April 20/2013)</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366492787397</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 17:19:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Encouraging, if you find it encouraging to put on the blinders.

Inertia is powerful. ANY upgrade is expensive and disruptive. Since there is no upgrade path to Win 7/8, some of them may very well go instead to Linux, or to MaxOS and Google Apps.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1366504494963</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-20 20:34:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366513500863-38</Id><Topic><Title>Win XP is outdated and all the IT industry has to upgrade to either Win7 or Win8.
