A couple of screenshots posted on PCBeta seems to confirm that Windows 8.1 build 9385 has been sent to developers around the world for testing purposes, as Microsoft is most likely working on the final preview version due this summer. No details are available for the time being, so we can’t tell for sure if this new build brings any significant changes or not, but it’s pretty clear that the public release of the operating system is nearing. Word is that Microsoft plans to unveil the first and the only beta in June at the BUILD developer conference, while the stable release might see daylight approximately two months after that.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366978523327</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 08:15:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366979067048-14</Id><Title>When they realize...</Title><Msg>that they can kick out Ballmer for many reasons this stock will dump where it was before: around $27 you can count on it..the writing is on the wall!</Msg><Username>misterx.herrx</Username><Timestamp>1366979067048</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 08:24:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366979401691-15</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT will own the Cloud business and here is why....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366931968933</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 19:19:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YOU are a fool that lives in the past....

With its refresh of nearly all of its flagship products, we expect Microsoft's core businesses to continue to show solid growth through 2013 and provide a catalyst for the shares. In addition, Microsoft's innovative new offerings and solid positioning in cloud computing show promise of new growth. With Microsoft's dominant market position, solid dividend yield, and attractively priced shares, we believe a Buy rating with a Growth &amp; Income suitability is appropriate. Core Businesses Gain Renewed Momentum Approximately nine out of every 10 PCs still run a Windows-based operating system. The Windows franchise is deeply entrenched within global enterprises, and, we believe Windows 8, which supports tablets and smartphones, will extend the viability of the franchise for years to come. In addition, a new version of Office that is optimized for both touch-based and cloud computing has recently been released. We believe these updates will drive healthy growth of Microsoft's core businesses. Windows 8 Provides Flexibility in Challenged PC Market For decades, Microsoft's Windows operating system has been engineered to support a single computer architecture, the x86 chipset found in most PCs and laptops. Microsoft's next version of Windows, Windows 8, will support both the traditional x86 chipset, as well as the low-power-consumption ARM chipset that powers most smartphones and tablets. Thus, Windows 8 represents a pivotal transition for Microsoft, one which should provide flexibility and allow it to extend the Windows franchise to the fast-growing mobile platform. Diverse Business Mix Yields Earnings Stability Outside of its renowned Windows and Office businesses, Microsoft's Server business has quietly become a major revenue driver for the firm and a source of consistent growth. The release of Windows Server 2012 should help maintain this trend. In addition, Microsoft's Xbox entertainment system is now the leading gaming console in the United States, while Microsoft's Bing search engine is second in terms of U.S. market share behind Google. Valuation We find Microsoft shares attractively priced at about 10 times our fiscal 2013 earnings estimate. This P/E ratio is below the overall market, despite our expectations for above-market long-term earnings growth.</Msg><Username>stagetec100</Username><Timestamp>1366997962916</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:39:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366998230063-43</Id><Topic><Title>iPad Slows As Surface Grows: Microsoft Proves Its Worth to Apple</Title><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1366997717258</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:35:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Apple grew from 11.8 to 19.5 million units shipped.

Today, a game developer claims that Microsoft and Sony have already lots a ton of money on the current generation of game consoles. Ben Cousins, a game developer who has worked at EA, Sony and other studios, currently works at Scattered Entertainment, which is making a first person shooter for the iOS platform. In a Kotaku article, he states that game consoles are sold at a loss so companies such as Microsoft can get the money back via license fees from each game that are sold on their systems. He shows, via Microsoft's own financial numbers. that the Xbox division has lost close to $3 billion in the last 10 fiscal years. Sony's gaming division lost even more money in the same time period, with a lost of almost $5 billion. Those number do include costs such as research and development, hardware production, marketing and PR and more which makes his personal view skewed. Cousins also says that of the 70 million Xbox 360 consoles sold since 2006, about 40 percent were bought since its last major price cut in 2009. He believes that indicates the people who bought the consoles at that time were looking for something that offered the best combination of price and performance and calls that group "mainstream gamers". -----------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1367004154350</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 15:22:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367005443901-63</Id><Topic><Title>iPad slows as Surface grows</Title><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1367000692887</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 14:24:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Surface line is going to a HUGE success as it evolves &amp; steadily takes out AAPL/GOOG</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1367005443901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 15:44:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367006266065-64</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT got 7% marketshare on tablets in 6 months, from nothing</Title><Username>seriouslynot</Username><Timestamp>1366990687438</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 11:38:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it actually 7.5% of quarterly sale. it nowhere near 7.5% market share. that would mean only 40 mio tablet ever sold, not 40 mio in qtr.,,,,,,,,,,,,,</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367006266065</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 15:57:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367007976445-65</Id><Topic><Title>Ghoul Obama Broadens His Support Of Infanticide</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1366997034418</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-26 13:23:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“We believe that any decision that’s made should be left up to the woman, her family, and the physician."

IF they elect to buy Surface Pro or RT and coming soon Surface 7, that would be great, if not as a minimum they would be buying Windows 8 OS which is a good thing.... SO I expect AAPL and Google based Tablets take a hit as Windows based Tablets will be the king of the road/mobility.... And that accounts for over staggering "80%" of the companies worldwide.... The numbers will be astronomical for Windows Tablets and Phones thus killing our competitors.... NOW you see why they are so afraid of Windows 8 and want MSFT to abandon it! What a joke.

Here is what I wrote before: "This was expected as CIOs want compatible OS in their organizations and if they are running Windows, Office and other MSFT products, they would want a Windows based Tablet and Phone for their employees as well and that they would do away with AAPL and Google OS and hardware/software as a result.... IF they elect to buy Surface Pro or RT and coming soon Surface 7, that would be great, if not as a minimum they would be buying Windows 8 OS which is a good thing.... SO I expect AAPL and Google based Tablets take a hit as Windows based Tablets will be the king of the road/mobility.... And that accounts for over staggering "80%" of the companies worldwide.... The numbers will be astronomical for Windows Tablets and Phones thus killing our competitors.... NOW you see why they are so afraid of Windows 8 and want MSFT to abandon it! What a joke".
