Ghosananon asks: "Well, they were black males. In fact, 8 recent robberies in that very neighborhood were all perped by black males per police reports. Can we not dare voice facts anymore? Orwell must be rejoicing at his prescience." I have been on private planes that went through customs, arriving from drug producing centers, where nothing was unloaded, the agents simply profiled us. We profile inanimate objects every day. Shoes and liquids at airports are suspect, while 85 year old grandmas are frisked to be fair. PSA's at airports tell us to watch for "suspicious" activity, which is profiling itself. As long as one is acting within the law, it's legal for one to pace, sweat, repeatedly check the time, etc. We are kidding ourselves that police don't profile daily. Someone should try a test with a red Porsche and a white 10 year old crown Vic running the same roadway speeding the same amount and see which gets the most tickets over time. Same experiment in the far left lane in a multi lane highway and inner lanes, you'll get far more tickets in the left lane going the same speed because police TARGET that lane because that's where speeders usually are. Until we stop kidding ourselves we are going to make little progress.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1374062016119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 07:53:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374062280334-6</Id><Topic><Title>The science of profiling</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1374062016119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 07:53:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope our next president is white, so we can end all this racist nonsense.</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1374062280334</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 07:58:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374062376467-7</Id><Topic><Title>Love my Samsung Google Chromebook</Title><Username>papa.weelee</Username><Timestamp>1374016746941</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 19:19:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Windows 8 is certainly no XP killer.

Quoting: "Google Inc’s. (NASDAQ:GOOG) paid enterprise business is starting to seriously pick up across Asia, as companies such as India’s Madras Cements, South Korea’s Posco, and Japan’s ANA Holdings Inc. incorporate Google software into their businesses. "In a market where Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) still dominates, Google is experiencing a boom, as Asian businesses adopt business-tailored versions of software such as Gmail, Google Maps, and other applications. Head of Enterprise at Google, Amit Singh, declined to detail specific figures, but told the Wall Street Journal that the business software adoption is happening much faster in Asia than in their American counterparts. " “Asian companies don’t have as much legacy to worry about,” Singh said. “There’s less to overcome and less to migrate over” when switching to Google tools from traditional business software. "Google enterprise tools also allow business software to be used on a variety of devices, and that is particularly important in Asia, where many access the Internet primarily through mobile devices, hampered by poor landline infrastructure, according to Singh." _________________________________ But it is happening in American businesses also, even though not as fast.

During the last wave of cable TV industry consolidation in 2006 the operators were the initial stocks to run, but afterwards the focus shifted to cable TV tech vendors. Seachange (SEAC) was the subject of a Brean Capital analyst research note this past December that said "Because of SEAC's leading position in key areas of MSO investment, it is not likely to remain an independent company in an industry consolidation scenario." SEAC has been rallying big in recent days, now that a wave of industry consolidation is here, soaring past its 52-week high of $12.10 on Monday and setting a new 52-week high yesterday of $12.50 where it trades with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.89. Back in 2006, SEAC was also the subject of takeover rumors - but in every article written about SEAC in 2006, its rival CCUR was mentioned as a potential takeover target as well. Since then, CCUR has actually surpassed SEAC to capture the #1 largest video on demand (VOD) technology market share, and CCUR also leads in other key areas like start-over/look-back, and Big Data Analytics. CCUR hasn't received any analyst research notes in recent months like SEAC, but if you look at the reasons Brean calls SEAC a takeover target - CCUR fits all of the same criteria, and CCUR is extremely undervalued vs. SEAC, with CCUR currently trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of only 0.71. For CCUR just to match SEAC's current enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.89, CCUR needs to rise to $16.21. Look for CCUR to explode in the weeks ahead, and for CCUR to surpass SEAC's share price next month. CCUR's 10-K filing is due out next month and CCUR's annual non-GAAP EPS could potentially reach $0.50, exceeding SEAC's current non-GAAP EPS of $0.44. CCUR recently raised its dividend by 100%, and now pays a huge dividend yield of 6.2%, the highest in the industry!</Msg><Username>tmdjv442</Username><Timestamp>1374072906348</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 10:55:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374072959649-32</Id><Topic><Title>The recovery illusion, played every day until "boom"</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1374071112898</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 10:25:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Housing starts fall "unexpectedly" to lowest level in a year.

None, nada, zero, zip, which is why they all agreed, despite their initial emotional response, to acquit. You can stand outside all day and argue a man who feels his life threatened has no rights, but the current law says he does. You can distract as Holder did with the "stand your ground" argument, but "stand your ground" defense was not even used in this case. He was returning to his car when jumped is what was presented, what the detective found credible and consistent and the jury weighed as true.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1374077751022</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-07-17 12:15:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374077752587-51</Id><Topic><Title>One other thing the Zimmerman case should make abundantly clear to all, is that liberals don't care about</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1374024125931</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-07-16 21:22:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The law governs, no law was violated and that was not an opinion it was confirmed by the jury."
