W. Mitt Romney has many crimes to answer for. And he's too lacking in stones to even attempt to disprove that he evaded the payment of any tax at all for ten years running. He certainly evaded taxes on his Utah and Belmont "primary residences" during the time that he was retroactively not involved in any of the Bain operations that show his signature claiming to be "sole controlling person" of Bain Capital. I happen not to be running for anything, you pathetic desperate diaper-soiling dunderhead. It's W. Mitt Romney who's shown to be the liar, fraud and perjurer here; something he should have "gotten out ahead of" quite a bit earlier than this point in time, don't you recall that sage advice being given?

Microsoft drops 'Metro' name for Windows 8 A potential trademark dispute has forced Microsoft to drop the Metro name for Windows 8's blocky, tile-based interface. Talks with an "important European partner" have brought about the change according to internal memos seen by tech news site The Verge. The partner is believed to be German retail giant Metro AG. Microsoft is currently working out what to call the interface and said the new name would be announced soon. Modern motion The tiled interface is used on both Windows 8 and Windows Phone and has been called "Metro" ever since Microsoft started showing off its designs for the software. Elements of it have also been used on older products such as the Zune media player. In documents sent out to developers and media months ago, Microsoft said Metro was the "code name for our design language". It added that Metro was picked because the name was "modern and clean. It's fast and in motion". Now documents sent out to developers are warning coders to avoid using the word when referring to the distinctive interface. The warning is believed to follow on from an internal memo sent by Microsoft's Legal and Corporate Affairs department which said the company had been threatened with legal action over its use of the name. The threat is believed to have been made by German retailer Metro AG, which owns trademarks on the word. Metro AG declined to comment on the claim. Instead of Metro, Microsoft has told developers to simply refer to the blocky display as a "Windows 8 style UI" for the time being. === Great name!

Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I’m now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause. My total turnaround, in such a short time, is the result of careful and objective analysis by the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project, which I founded with my daughter Elizabeth. Our results show that the average temperature of the earth’s land has risen by two and a half degrees Fahrenheit over the past 250 years, including an increase of one and a half degrees over the most recent 50 years. Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/30/opinion/the-conversion-of-a-climate-change-skeptic.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all</Msg><Username>captain_snotty</Username><Timestamp>1344028503000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 17:15:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344029023000-49</Id><Topic><Title>Conversion of a Climate-Change Skeptic</Title><Username>captain_snotty</Username><Timestamp>1344028503000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 17:15:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Science is that narrow realm of knowledge that, in principle, is universally accepted.
