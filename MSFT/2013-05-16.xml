It could potentially double very quickly in the weeks ahead. Almost nobody is aware of CCUR yet, but their EPS has been rapidly ramping up from $0.02, to $0.04, to $0.08, and $0.11, over the most recent four quarters! CCUR is currently only $7.09 with 8.75mm outstanding shares, a market cap of $62.07mm, cash of $22.37mm, an enterprise value of $39.7mm, and revenues of $63.23mm! CCUR is the pay-TV industry's market share leading VOD and multi-screen software company with many extremely large clients like Time Warner Cable, Virgin Media, Cox, Charter, Bright House, and Rogers. CCUR's new IP CDN technology allows pay-TV operators to combine their classic RF-based VOD infrastructure with their newly deployed IP-based networks to deliver VOD to tablets, smartphones, and other IP connected mobile devices, while rapidly and cost effectively expanding the amount of on demand content that they provide to their customers. CCUR's IP CDN software solutions now deliver VOD programming to the iOS and Android mobile devices of Time Warner Cable's 12 million TV customers! CCUR's main competitors are SEAC, which has gross margins of 52% and an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.65, and HLIT, which has gross margins of 46% and an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.90. CCUR has much larger gross margins of 59% and is very undervalued with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of just 0.63. CCUR has record trailing GAAP EPS of $0.25 while SEAC and HLIT currently have GAAP EPS losses. CCUR needs to soar to a new 52-week high of over $9 to reach HLIT's ratio and $14.47 to reach SEAC's ratio! Soon CCUR will soon revolutionize the pay-TV industry with their new cloud based network DVR technology that will make today's physical DVR boxes obsolete!</Msg><Username>rblatuis</Username><Timestamp>1368684531645</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 02:08:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368685321488-18</Id><Topic><Title>Google Chromebook</Title><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1368679001948</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 00:36:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no! that how he save money on toilet paper. ;-D</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368685321488</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 02:22:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368691523781-19</Id><Topic><Title>Google says it has 900 million Android activations, launches new Android API to improve apps</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368646911121</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:41:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's 800 million more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses 'sold'.

But there are no racists that support the Tea Party because the only racists left in America are solidly on the left. They have a whole industry of promoting race, introducing a racial aspect to every story, stirring racial tensions where there are none, etc. There is no such thing as a conservative racist. The Tea Party is comprised of millions of Americans from every walk and phase of life who had never in their lives been active in politics beyond voting until "fundamental transformation" came to us in 2008. They formed by neighbor talking to neighbor, and they gathered by the thousands in Washington, and on the steps of state capitols across the nation because they saw the looming destruction with federal activism, spending and expansion. They were once again dumping the tea in the harbor in protest. They weren't funded by anyone other than covering their own expenses. There was no singular leader.

I am unemployed in the sense that I don't work for someone else anymore. But I pay more in taxes every year than you earn all together. I pay over $50K in property taxes alone. I wasn't alive when segregation was practiced. About 30% of the kids at my high school were black. Being in athletics, I would say that my closest group of friends was about half white and half black. All of my friends made decent grades, were respectful (except for the standard allowance for teenagers), and have now gone on to prosperous lives and families, college or not. The kids, black and white, who chose to be the thugs, or druggies, or do-the-bare-minimum-to-get-by sloths, were not my friends, and now have their own lives of low-paying jobs, welfare and a few in prison that I know of. You are right about one thing, although I am not hawcreek. My opinions do not change anymore, not since my foundationless mush-minded days of being a liberal.

The fact is, our self-engrandized king could care less about the representation of interests of these most productive and honorable Americans.

Here is the definition of a Desktop computer from Wiki: "A desktop computer is a personal computer in a form intended for regular use at a single location, as opposed to a mobile laptop or portable computer. Early desktop computers are designed to lie flat on the desk, while modern towers stand upright. Most modern desktop computers have separate screens and keyboards".

A must-read article, called to my attention almost by accident by corneliusflake. Looks like Google is doing again what it has done before. Google isn't painting itself into a corner, it's painting Microsoft into a corner. Google doesn't set out with great fanfare to make an alternative to Microsoft's core products. It does a number of separate things, then closes the circle quietly, and little by little it dawns on us that Microsoft is surrounded, with nowhere to go.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368722013733</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:33:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368722244620-155</Id><Topic><Title>ossobucco Get me Jacked for Xbox</Title><Username>douglas7white</Username><Timestamp>1368721487508</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 12:24:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually, something like 85% of the people in the country subscribe to cable. Their will be lower prices and better choices on cable from Microsoft partners and you won't need a cable box. It comes right from the XBOX. You can use you NOKIA LUMIA phones as remote controls. It is the living room changer. Xbox music is the only one that allows you to listen to music for free. Just choose the smart DJ. The blu ray, streaming and internet experience will be irresistible. If you are talking about shorting this stock you do not know what you are doing. I am trying to help you not bash you. It sounds like you are brand new to the stock market if you are shorting a stock that has significant declining short interest (has to go up) and they are releasing a game changing product.

The total income of the US population, and the % tax on it received is what the govt sees. We all own it equally after it is paid. If there is one trillion $ income from one person(doesn't exist of course) and 200 million people making $5,000 income, the one person pays half, the 200 milion pay the other half given the same rate. It doesn't matter the one person paid more in amount, that person still gets one citizenship and one say, just like each of the 200 million. That the one person paid half doesn't mean they paid more than their fair share, "paid too much", because it is called income-tax, not use-tax.or per capita-tax.

Researchers discovered political motivations may have evolutionary links to physical strength. Men's upper-body strength predicts their political opinions on economic redistribution, according to the research.

And why he isn't to blame for every happening in the country. You want him to be a king and control all on one hand, but when he wants to do something, you prevent him doing it, on the other. You criticize him on both ends. No one I have seen in office is less self engrandizing than Barack Obama. That's all in your mind. Our President rightly cares about equal representation, which is what America is about. You want him to do selective representation based on tax paid. Those who pay more tax get more say. That's not how we do things in America.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1368726768725</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 13:52:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368728288770-185</Id><Title>bellini admit you were stupid</Title><Msg>face it you need to go straight sell rating my #$%$</Msg><Username>mct18pipes</Username><Timestamp>1368728288770</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 14:18:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368728615522-186</Id><Topic><Title>The new "Tea Party" slanders the name of the original group</Title><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1368719225321</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 11:47:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You wouldn't know a tea Party follower if you saw one.

Worth mentioning that the article is in Visual Studio Magazine, hardly an anti-Microsoft platform. Quoting in part: "Microsoft has been fighting a platform war for several years, to protect the Windows franchise. The opponents in this war have been Apple iOS devices as well as the Mac and, to a lesser extent, Google Android. Meanwhile, HTML5 and JavaScript (H5JS) have been less of an overt threat. While their cross-platform capabilities loosen the grip of the Windows native platform, H5JS applications nonetheless run nicely on Windows, Office and SharePoint (see my September 2012 column, "JavaScript's Ascendance Within Microsoft")." "But now the H5JS threat is becoming more significant. Two key initiatives out of Google are driving this, and creating challenges to Microsoft, both in terms of platform dominance and business model. What does this mean for developers on the Microsoft platform? Will your skill sets lose marketability? Will you need new tools? Or is H5JS just a paper tiger, destined to be trumped once again by the various native platforms?

M$ is toast</Title><Msg>On The register now. A snippet:- So it's official - the lifelong battle of legendary Apple CEO Steve Jobs is finally won, now that he has toppled the PC platform from beyond the grave: well, in the UK, at least. During Q1 this year more slablets were shipped into consumer and business channels than PCs - that's notebooks AND desktops COMBINED. Beancounting scriveners at IDC confirmed the shock figures to the The Channel, with 2.8 million tabs reaching the warehouses of retailers and distributors, up a scorching 188 per cent on last year. In the same three-month period, 2.3 million PCs were sent into channels, possibly to moulder in unsold piles, representing a decline of 15 per cent. This included a 20 per cent fall in portables and a six per cent decline in desktops. "The reason notebooks are declining at a faster rate than desktops is that they are more exposed to substitution from the tablet," Catherine Lowry, EMEA PC analyst told The Channel. She added that when someone buys a tab as a secondary device, "it extends the life of the notebook, resulting in a less frequent replacement cycle". There was no hiding place for PC vendors - both the consumer and business PC segments declined, down 19 and 11 per cent respectively. Lowry said premium pricing for touch-enabled PCs deterred all but the best-paid early adopters, and ultrabooks were still above mainstream pricing. "As a result, consumers continued to opt for competitively priced tablets, particularly the new 7-inch devices.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368742570980</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 18:16:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368742857356-253</Id><Title>A Clean Slate Here Now</Title><Msg>Nice and clean.</Msg><Username>punch_the_hippie</Username><Timestamp>1368742857356</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 18:20:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368746758309-254</Id><Topic><Title>Men who are physically strong are more likely to have right wing political views</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368733981829</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:53:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>""I bet you know a lot too."

Quote:- Maybe the PC isn't dead, but it's definitely showing signs of old age. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices were off more than 12 percent Thursday on a downgrade from Goldman Sachs. And the PC market in Europe saw a sharp decline in the first quarter, according to Gartner. Goldman downgraded AMD's stock from "neutral" to "sell," saying that AMD's upside in gaming devices, like Sony's upcoming PlaySation 4, "only partially offsets the continued...challenges in the company's core PC business." AMD is the second-largest maker of processors for PCs. Dell was hit hard on Thursday, too, reporting a 79 percent drop in profit due to slumping PC sales. The PC maker posted its earnings five days earlier than planned, due to The Wall Street Journal reporting leaked numbers. Maybe more damning is the collapse of the PC market in Europe in the first quarter. "The first quarter of 2013 brought the worst quarterly decline in Western Europe since Gartner started tracking PC shipments in this region," said Meike Escherich, principal research analyst at Gartner.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368748714605</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 19:58:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368749667611-258</Id><Topic><Title>Men who are physically strong are more likely to have right wing political views</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368733981829</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 15:53:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When even Chris Matthews realizes this President is incompetent as an executive, it's finally game over.

Here are some points relevant to MSFT: Branded as "Knox" by Samsung, the new software adds support for a series of enterprise features Android has lagged iOS in supporting. The first of these, support for "Advanced Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync features," was first addressed by Apple five years ago in 2008's iOS 2.0. The second feature, "on-device AES 256-bit encryption," is a prerequisite of Microsoft's Exchange default policy settings. Apple began supporting hardware device encryption with the iPhone 3GS in 2009. A third feature touted by Samsung is VPN support, a notable problem for Android users that want to connect to various remote networking systems. It's also a feature Apple began addressing along with Exchange support back in 2008's iOS 2.0. Apple has regularly enhanced its VPN support on iOS devices in subsequent releases over the last half decade.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368752993636</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:09:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368753420226-274</Id><Topic><Title>DELL earnings are down 79%, but osso-di ldo thinks that's good.</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368752080472</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 20:54:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did you see the revenue number?</Msg><Username>douglas7white</Username><Timestamp>1368753420226</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:17:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368753535223-275</Id><Title>Newvem launches new Windows Azure cloud -anagement tools to help enterprises act like startups....</Title><Msg>Folks this a great article, Just Bing it!

The first devices were planned to hit the market in second half of 2012. It was then clarified that first quarter of 2013 is not a date of actual product launch but demonstration at Mobile World Congress.Tizen Devices made by Samsung would ship in 2013, perhaps in August or September, then replaced to "Later in 2013" but the exact date has not been disclosed. Relation to bada OS: A possible cause of delay is Samsung's transition to bada on top of Linux as a base for the operating system, that publicly materialized in the final 2.0 release. As a consequence the frameworks coming from the bada OS cover EFL frameworks and make them private and thus not available for general use by application developers. Licensing model: Presented originally as an open source operating system, Tizen 2 has a complicated licensing model. Its SDK is built on top of open source components but the entire SDK has been published under a non-open-source Samsung license. The operating system itself consists of many open source components. A number of components internally developed by Samsung are however released under the Flora License which is most likely "incompatible with requirements of the Open Source Initiative". Therefore it is not known whether the native application framework and its graphical components can be legally utilized for Free and Open Source Software such as GPL appl</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368755254764</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:47:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368755439899-284</Id><Title>Obama Either Lies Outright or Dodges Reporters Questions</Title><Msg>It depends on what he thinks he can get away with.</Msg><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1368755439899</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:50:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368755674276-285</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Either Lies Outright or Dodges Reporters Questions</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1368755439899</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:50:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is a smooth and very experienced liar but he is smart enough to ignore or dodge questions where a lie might soon be discovered.</Msg><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1368755674276</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:54:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368756060176-286</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung Knox gets official DoD approval for government use</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368753970112</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 21:26:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that was back on may 3rd! couldn't the d.o.d. have decided since then that knox will never work and had someone at apple insider publish an article to dispel the truth? wait, dispel the truth ... that's not how that saying goes, is it?

It's not flying off the shelves at the moment because people aren't used to the new software. But here/'s the trick that got me thinking; msft is no longer supporting the windows 7 or below. All those computers with W7 and below will need to be rpelaced by W8. Hence users (both business and retailers) have to replace all their old computers with W8 machines, after which they will get used to the new software-- WILL NOT HAVE A NEED FOR THE PURE TABLETS ANYMORE. In two years, no one will be buying pure tablets like ipads or kindles-- these are just toys. The new xbox is claimed to have lots of features. It is no longer just a game consule; it is a portal to Cable TV, internet, Skype, music, movies, neflix. It will be the consule to every living room in the world.</Msg><Username>kevinvests</Username><Timestamp>1368762822379</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 23:53:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368762971561-310</Id><Topic><Title>Why Surface RT Tablets Will Not Work</Title><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1368757273024</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 22:21:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we? you realize you must identify yourself as an officer or employee of the company. if you are one ... if you aren't one then you are identifying yourself as someone who just spews beef stew. :-D</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368762971561</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 23:56:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
