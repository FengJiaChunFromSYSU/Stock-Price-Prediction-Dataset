Another piece falls into place. In a press conference last week Obama was not wearing his wedding ring nor was he wearing his watch. When noticed, his staff said his ring was out for repairs. No reason was given for the missing watch. So it's just a coincidence that Muslims are forbidden from wearing jewelry during the month of Ramadan? Can't possibly be that, because although he hasn't gone to a Christian church service since entering the White House, we know he's a committed Christian "cause he said so during his campaign!" ...........And I've got a bridge to nowhere to sell you also. This is the same president that spent the Christmas holidays in Hawaii to avoid religious obligations as PRESIDENT at the White House. His children do not receive Christmas presents. Let's just face the facts and quit trying to distort the truth, we have a Muslim for president in the White House, and he has no knowledge of American history.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350049882317</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:51:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350050721452-55</Id><Topic><Title>A Heavenly Tweet</Title><Username>plmartin_2012</Username><Timestamp>1350049623188</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 09:47:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Biden showed Ryan the Buckwheat LOL</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1350050721452</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 10:05:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350050927730-56</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Drops SEAL Story After Mother Complains</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1349970994698</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 11:56:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I doubt if the prez sets the security at embassies directly.

(You can easily check this with a web search.) If the wedding ring has suddenly disappeared maybe its because someone wants to keep the inscription secret.

If former General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch’s charges of a political fix to manipulate economic data ahead of the presidential election are true, there must be a vast econometric conspiracy embracing auto dealers, real estate agents, the Federal Reserve and corporate America’s 96-year-old Conference Board. The economy is improving more than professional forecasters anticipated, particularly in data on employment and housing, according to the Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index, which compares 38 indicators with analysts’ predictions. The index, based on gauges compiled by private businesses and trade groups in addition to government, confirms U.S. growth is generating jobs in the face of a global slowdown and looming federal spending cuts and tax increases known as the fiscal cliff.</Msg><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1350059559087</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 12:32:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350059682289-74</Id><Topic><Title>There is an inscription on Obama's wedding ring!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>natasha.fatale011</Username><Timestamp>1349962367971</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 09:32:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Google your subject line to see how stupid you are.

Some conservatives said that Biden made the '19 million' figure up. | AP Photo By JOANNE KENEN | 10/12/12 3:22 PM EDT Made up or mixed up? A lot of big numbers get thrown around in the Medicare debate, but that one doesn’t crop up a lot. Some conservatives said flat out that Biden made it up in the debate with Ryan. But the Obama campaign says Biden just misspoke. He meant Medicaid, according to campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith. Biden has said in several other campaign appearances that 19 million would be tossed off Medicaid, which the GOP wants to turn into a block grant to the states. In fact, he’s taken the lead in critiquing the Ryan Medicaid proposal, which he says would slash spending on the poor and hurt people in nursing homes — “your moms and your dads.” But Medicaid didn’t come up at the debate other than one passing reference to how it purchases drugs. Conservatives said Biden’s 19 million Medicare comment was … malarkey. “This is an entirely made-up figure,” Manhattan Institute fellow and health care blogger Avik Roy wrote on National Review’s The Corner. “Not a single person would lose their Medicare coverage under Ryan’s budgets, and not a single person would under Romney’s plan either.” Even if Biden meant to say Medicaid, it’s not entirely clear where he got the 19 million number and whether it applied to Romney’s campaign proposals or Ryan’s 2011 budget plan. A May 2011 Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured study said block grants could lead to 19 million more uninsured — although under other scenarios in that same study, the number could rise by as much as 27 million. That was drawing from the 2011 version of Ryan’s budget, which has been modified and which Romney has said won’t be identical to his own spending blueprint. A Center for Budget and Policy Priorities paper analyzing the Romney-Ryan budget proposals — to the extent the campaign has fleshed them out — estimated that cuts to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program might mean 14 million to 19 million more uninsured people. Whatever Biden spoke or misspoke, it didn’t make the Romney campaign’s list of Biden’s “top five lies and exaggerations.” But plenty of other health care claims did.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350071531271</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 15:52:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350071534965-96</Id><Topic><Title>So, It was the House Republicans that cut embassy security.....and they were Warned.</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1350063125741</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:32:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey IDIOT.

Republicans have questioned whether the State Department had adequate security to protect the ambassador, and Democrats have countered that Republicans tried to cut funding for embassy security. What does the budget record show? According to the fiscal year (FY) 2013 Congressional Budget Justification Department of State Operations (p. 11), overall funding for those programs has increased sharply over the past decade. Indeed, Worldwide Security Protection is more than double what it was a decade ago. Despite reductions from budget peaks in FY 2009 and FY 2010, both budget lines are higher than in FY 2008.

We don’t need more M1 tanks, what we need is more UAVs," Biden said, referring to unmanned aerial vehicles, many of which are tested and developed at Wright Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton. Since the M1 is made at the Lima tank plant, Romney backers are spreading the word about the potential impact of such cuts. “While the world grows more hostile and unstable every day, the White House wants to take away one of the most vital weapons in our arsenal -- made right here in Ohio. Giving our troops the tools they need just isn’t a priority for Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Their own budget would shut down America’s only M-1 tank plant,” says the radio spot, airing in central and northwest Ohio. “As an Ohioan, you know that’s not just an attack against our ability to defend our freedom. It’s also an attack against our jobs and our way of life. Two attacks. Which one is worse?” Senator Rob Portman, who preps Mitt Romney for his debates and is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released a statement saying: “Since World War II, there have been reoccurring predictions that the days of tanks and ground combat vehicles were behind us, but it never takes long for those predictions to be shattered. In last night's debate, Vice President Biden added himself to this list of naysayers. The past decade has once again demonstrated the critical role of tanks in fulfilling our national security. The Army knows it needs to upgrade its tanks in a few years, but if the White House has their short-sighted way, there may not be a ready U.S. industrial base to do it." The Republican senator's release said M1 Abrams tanks and other tracked vehicle production require unique parts suppliers and workforce skills, and that Ohio is home to 65 suppliers, including the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima. Continued production will sustain a unique set of industrial facilities and, more importantly, protect a highly skilled workforce that oftentimes has decades of experience and is not easily replaced, Portman added. Abrams production accounts for 800 jobs in Lima alone. Loss of these jobs would be a blow to Ohio’s economy during a time of $16 trillion deficits and anemic economic growth, the senator said.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350072260569</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 16:04:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350072792416-102</Id><Title>Biden LIED about not Voting for the Wars....</Title><Msg>He voted both for the Iraq and Afgan. wars.

Durham School Services confirmed in a statement to Fox News that the 78-year-old driver “engaged in a political debate with students” and “made an inappropriate remark to a child.” After a brief investigation, the driver was subsequently fired, the statement read. “The driver’s remark was insensitive and inappropriate,” the statement read. “Durham has apologized to the family.” The incident occurred in New Bern, Wis. and was first reported by the Freedom Eden website. The child’s mother was a guest on Fox News Radio affiliate WISN where she told her side of the story. She said the trouble started two weeks ago when they put a Romney sign in their front yard. “The only reason your parents are Romney fans is because they’re rich,” she allegedly told the child. The boy’s mother – who was only identified as Debbie – told the radio station that several days ago some students in the back of the bus were chanting “Romney, Romney.” “She made my son come up to the front (of the bus) and told him all Republicans are liars,” she said. “He didn’t want to take it. He said Obama is pro-abortion. She said, ‘Well, maybe your mom should have chosen abortion for you.’” The mother said her son was crying and said he never wanted to get on the bus again. “He goes to a Catholic school,” she said. “He was told that he should have been aborted.” After she notified the bus company the driver was immediately removed from service until they completed the investigation. The company stated the driver had an incident-free record for more than 20 years.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350088714005</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 20:38:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350088729999-122</Id><Title>MSFT pricing for Windows 8</Title><Msg>Microsoft prices Windows 8, taking pre-orders 10/12 03:05 PM SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Microsoft Corp.
