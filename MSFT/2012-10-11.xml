Samantha Pawlucy briefly returned to Charles Carroll High School in the city's Port Richmond section Tuesday. That's after she says she was mocked last week by her teacher for wearing the shirt supporting the Republican presidential candidate. But her father, Richard Pawlucy, tells The Philadelphia Inquirer that his daughter never actually made it to class. Instead, she went into the school offices following a rally held by her supporters because she felt uncomfortable. He says Samantha and two other high-school age children in his home will be transferring to another school, possibly a charter school. Geometry teacher Lynette Gaymon has apologized in a letter read to students by the school principal on Tuesday, saying she meant her remarks to be "light and humorous" and they "never meant to belittle" the student or cause any harm. Superintendent William Hite Jr. has called the ordeal a "teachable moment" and said he will work with the mayor and the teachers union to move "towards a conversation that brings together diverse beliefs, inspires understanding, and heals."</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1349955422208</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 07:37:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349956222135-11</Id><Topic><Title>Executive Orders Issued.</Title><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1349950559586</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 06:15:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Factcheck your 923 numbers, I think it is more like 139 not good.

The firm has about $20 billion in assets under management. “It just adds to the picture of a U.S. economy that’s recovering. Not as fast as anyone would like, but still improving.” Stocks extended gains after Labor Department figures showed fewer Americans than forecast filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week, which may reflect difficulty adjusting the data for seasonal swings at the start of a new quarter. Jobless Benefits Applications for jobless benefits dropped 30,000 to 339,000 in the week ended Oct. 6, the fewest since February 2008. Economists forecast 370,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. One state accounted for most of the plunge in claims, a Labor Department spokesman said. The year’s increase was smaller than projected, because one large state showed a drop rather than an increase, said the spokesman, who declined to name the state. The breakdown by state will show up in next week’s report. “The economy is improving, we’re doing a better job,” Philip Orlando, the New York-based chief equity strategist at Federated Investors Inc., which oversees about $370 billion, said by phone. “I think we should be going faster but this is a phenomenal claims number. So now the question is, ‘Is this number real or is it going to get revised away next week?’” He said, “Give me some meat so I understand why it’s a good number and whether it’s sustainable.”</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1349968715894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 11:18:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349968806797-36</Id><Title>MSFT: Biggest Products Launch since Windows 95, stock $35+ soon, dobule next 2 years</Title><Msg>Big moves into search, soical, Mobile and Tablets ( that you can actually do work on) Get ready the stock is a double in a year!

After expectations of a rebound in initial claims from 367K last week (naturally revised higher to 369K), to 370K (with the lowest of all sellside expectations at 355K), the past week mysteriously, yet so very unsurprisingly in the aftermath of the fudged BLS unemployment number, saw claims tumble to a number that is so ridiculous not even CNBC's Steve Liesman bothered defending it, or 339K. Ironically, not even the Labor Department is defending it: it said that "one large state didn't report some quarterly figures." Great, but what was reported was a headline grabbing number that is just stunning for reelection purposes. This was the lowest number since 2008. The only point to have this print? For 2-3 bulletin talking points at the Vice Presidential debate tonight. Everything else is now noise. It is also sad that the US "economy" has devolved to such trivial data fudging on a week by week basis, which makes even the Chinese Department of Truth appear amateurish by comparison. Needless to say, Not Seasonally Adjusted initial claims jumped by 26K to 327K in the past week but who's counting. Finally, what is the reason for ongoing QEternity if the employment situation is now back to normal. Finally, in completely ignored news, because who needs global trade when you have toner cartridge, and generally ink, the US trade deficit in August rose by 4.1% to $44.2 billion, on expectations of a deterioration to $44.0 billion. Then again nobody talks about the US trade deficit during presidential debates so all good here.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349972719270</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 12:25:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349972759924-71</Id><Topic><Title>I am wondering just how many Black so called Christians will vote for a Gay marriage supporter.</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1349928862127</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 00:14:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Morning Jay: Politics and the Gallup Poll 6:00 AM, Oct 11, 2012 • By JAY COST Single Page Print Larger Text Smaller Text Alerts Since about the beginning of President Obama’s tenure, the Gallup poll has generally been one of the least positive polls for the Democratic party. This has prompted outrage and pressure from the left--even from presidential advisor David Axelrod. Axelrod David Over the summer Mark Blumenthal of Huffington Post wrote a critique of Gallup’s daily presidential job approval poll. The point of which was that Gallup was over-sampling whites and thus understating President Obama’s position in the adult population. I responded by arguing that Blumenthal’s case was underdeveloped and less-than-met-the-eye, and that was basically where things stood. Until, that is, this week. President Obama enjoyed a bounce in his Gallup job approval number after the Democratic National Convention, as was to be expected, but there was a twist: it did not disappear. And while Gallup on average had found Obama’s job approval around 47 percent with adults through most of 2012, for the last five weeks it has been regularly above 50 percent. Yesterday, it stood at 53 percent, a number we have not really seen since 2009.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349972759924</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 12:25:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349973333273-72</Id><Topic><Title>Check this out</Title><Username>gertrudishqq990897</Username><Timestamp>1349966604786</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 10:43:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job.

With cable, like Paul Allen's then Charter, cable could be viewed in HD wireless, so to speak. You see, green energy coul now be a bright light like blade servers in a universal power supply..bits and bytes are bytes and bits in the 900MGHz spectrum which could bleed into a bright solar power supply creating a un-interupted power supply. Along with,television screens and other objects at minimul cost. You see, we don't need debate, an unlimited power supply is already here! Just invest in Microsoft for the future and you will, over time, make a mint. The supply is endless, if only the candidates could invest in a winner, or maybe a few now private companies. IE Pixels sililiar to a hard line with solar recievers behind them. Think of 3D standing out like a sore thumb without glasses. The big secret no-one wants to be able to know about!..... is here! I guess, I'm a nobody have invented the idea! Bil Gates and Paul Allen are laghing all the way to the bank on me,I suppose, yet I started it all. I guess I should go down in history for being the one who got it al started. Accumulate for the long term, that should be quite a debate...WE HAVE IT HERE FOLKS NOW. Right....Just like a UFO with air blowing in two directions in an opposite spiral equaling out like a helicopter....just kidding..not!</Msg><Username>urbanforestcare</Username><Timestamp>1350007523562</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 22:05:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350008804553-110</Id><Title>Solar like it should be!</Title><Msg>We talk about solar like it should be. Yet, back when Metricom and Transmeta were alive I emailed Transmata to get a screen working wirelessly..just like the screen you see. Uninterupted power supplies could be used like blade servers wirelessly, yet now private companies. The debate should be to pick some winners like MSFT, the olnly Company left on the stock market, with hubs as bright as could be using solar with bits int the 900MGHZ spectrum bleeding wirelessly. Just like UFO's with jets spiraling down in opposite directions Cable companies could use 3D wireless without glassess wirelessly to screens. This is how the debate should go.

"We weren't told they wanted more security. We did not know they wanted more security there," Biden said. In fact, two security officials who worked for the State Department in Libya at the time testified Thursday that they repeatedly requested more security and two State Department officials admitted they had denied those requests. "All of us at post were in sync that we wanted these resources," the top regional security officer in Libya over the summer, Eric Nordstrom, testified. "In those conversations, I was specifically told [by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charlene Lamb] ‘You cannot request an SST extension.' I determined I was told that because there would be too much political cost. We went ahead and requested it anyway. Nordstrom was so critical of the State Department's reluctance to respond to his calls for more security that he said, "For me, the Taliban is on the inside of the building." "We felt great frustration that those requests were ignored or just never met," testified Lt. Col. Andrew Wood, a Utah National Guardsman who was leading a security team in Libya until August. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-CA) released the unclassified cables containing those requests. Paul Ryan pointed out the testimony to Biden during the debate. Ryan also erred when he criticized the State Department for assigning Marines to protect the ambassador in France but not Amb. Chris Stevens, who died in Benghazi on Sept. 11. "Our ambassador in Paris has a marine detachment guarding him, shouldn't we have a Marine detachment guarding our ambassador in Benghazi?," Ryan said. According to the U.S. Embassy Paris website, there is a Marine Security Guard Detachment in the embassy, but they are there primarily to protect classified information and are not part of the ambassador's personal security detail. "The mission of the Marine Security Guards is to provide internal security at designated United States Diplomatic and Consular facilities to prevent the compromise of classified material and equipment which, if compromised, would cause serious damage to the national security interests of the United States; and to provide protection for U.S. citizens and property within the principal buildings of the Mission," the website reads, noting that in certain situations the Marines might be in a position to protect the chief of mission. Ryan also criticized President Barack Obama for attributing the Benghazi attack to an anti-Islam video and he referred to comments today by Obama campaign spokesman Stephanie Cutter, who said the Benghazi issue was only politically relevant because the Romney-Ryan campaign was pushing it.</Msg><Username>onedinosaur</Username><Timestamp>1350010072906</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 22:47:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350011675617-114</Id><Title>The monkey is gone!</Title><Msg>!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1350011675617</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 23:14:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350013017707-115</Id><Topic><Title>Jobless numbers missing California data?</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1349995512722</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 18:45:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DEMOCRIMINALS ARE LYING CROOKS, GOD HATERS</Msg><Username>mishaelena</Username><Timestamp>1350013017707</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-11 23:36:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350013841853-116</Id><Title>Another right wing conspiracy theory debunked, a self serving conspiracy at that.
