Fortunately most of us know his job gets vacations, and like most jobs, he gets what others got. He isn't giving himself these things, they are normal things every President gets. Have you gone through congress and made a list of their vacations and how much they cosr? Of course you haven't, because you have the mind of a 1960 segregationist when it comes to the President. Now that you have posted your ongoing ridiculous obsession with Obama riding in the front of the bus, what do you think you change? Not a thing. Why don't you go and feed the poor or something. Oh I forgot you are out of a job and pay no fed tax.

They argued that it was their right to be called integers and excluding them from the integers was discriminatory. It was pointed out to the irrationals that including them with the integers was logically impossible, that the very essence of the integers precluded their being irrationals and the very essence of the irrationals precluded them from being integers. The irrationals said that none of that mattered, that they wanted to be integers, it was their right, and any opposition was obviously motivated by numerophobia. They vowed to take their case to the courts where they had arranged to have many dishonest friends. Well, no one can say how the court cases will come out or how much success the irrationals may have persuading people to support their point of view (government education being what it is), but one thing is tautologically certain: the irrationals will never actually be integers.</Msg><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1364500212104</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 15:50:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364501032386-50</Id><Topic><Title>S&amp;P At All Time Record - Thanks Obama!!</Title><Username>captain_zee</Username><Timestamp>1364495630607</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 14:33:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>:::::We are not going back to the supply side economic scam of the Koch Bros/Dubya Bush empire.::: No we are not.
