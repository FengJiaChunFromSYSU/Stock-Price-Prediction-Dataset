MILLER in Louisville, Ky. Last Updated: 5:58 AM, October 13, 2012 Posted: 2:06 AM, October 13, 2012 Mitt Romney seized the lead in yet another batch of polls in critical swing states yesterday, continuing his astonishing turnaround since he debated President Obama in Denver. In battleground Virginia — where Romney continued to reference his own performance while lauding his running mate Paul Ryan’s Thursday debate in Kentucky — Romney leads Obama 49-47 percent in the latest Rasmussen poll. Romney also seized a narrow 48-47 percent lead in Colorado in a new Denver Post/Survey USA poll, following a Quinnipiac University poll that also gave him a 1-point edge. Romney also moved up in New Hampshire, leading 50-46 percent in the latest ARG poll in a state where Obama appeared to have opened a significant lead by the end of September. That puts even more pressure on Obama to win Ohio, where he continues to hold a slight lead. The president plans to return there on Wednesday, while Romney and Ryan stump there this weekend. Romney’s poll surge directly coincides with his drubbing of Obama in their first debate — and Romney made sure to talk up Ryan’s performance yesterday while addressing an outdoor crowd at a Mobility Supercenter, a company providing wheelchairs and accessible vans. Romney and Obama face off again Tuesday at Hofstra University on Long Island. “I think you might agree with me that there was one person on stage last night who was thoughtful, respectful, steady and poised — the kind of person you want to turn to in a crisis,” Romney said, referring to Ryan. Without naming Vice President Joe Biden, Romney added, “The other candidate, of course, just attacked.” The Republican National Committee was more direct, releasing a one-minute video featuring Biden’s array of broad smiles, smirks and laughs during the debate. The ad contrasts some of Biden’s goofier grins with a deadly serious Ryan on a split screen. The tag line: “Vice President Biden is laughing . . . are you?” Supporters at Romney’s event had already reached the same conclusion. “Biden was very disrespectful, sneering like they’ve done something,” said Shelly Hall, a self-employed Romney backer. “Probably this way, south of the Mason-Dixon line, it probably really turned off a lot of independents, because of the rudeness,” said Joy Cobb, a real estate agent from south of Richmond. Obama sent out a fund-raising e-mail to supporters, saying he was “proud” of Biden.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350128455794</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 07:40:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350130086228-18</Id><Topic><Title>Hillary didn't tell Rice to go out and lie to the American people about Bengazi</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350092109265</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 21:35:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hillary is in it with nobumba, all lies.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1350130086228</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 08:08:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350130174272-19</Id><Topic><Title>If you voted for the commie Kenyan</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350127746439</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 07:29:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think we should hold all these dumbocrap voters responsible.

The rich have sucked out over a trillion dollars in money they owe us in taxws in the past ten years. They say Jack Kennedy lowered taxes. Yes he did, but from 91% on the wealthiest, 91%, down to 72% I think it was. It was high so as to build America with, and people who went through WWII and saw how close we were to speaking German and enduring our own holocaust on these shores, so so close, UNDERSTOOD it takes money to BUILD a successful comfortable society. You didn't build that, you built your part of that, like Obama so correctly stated. Taxes on the wealthy were lowered and lowered, and loopholes installed year by year so now we have people like Mitt Romney hiring teams of tax attorneys to take advantage of every hole, and pay less than 14% tax rate. That's lower than 91% for you rwnj's. That's what's wrong and what we need to correct. A company hires people why? When the have more need for more people, why? when they sell more goods. how? when us, the great middle class, BUY THE GOODS. Not one job is created by giving rich people a discount on their taxes from an already historically low rate. It goes into their bank account so they cn buy more collector cars, caviar, and 12 million houses with auto elevators. No one hires people unless they need more people. Isn't that a little obvious? The tea party is nuts.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1350138297339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 10:24:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350138379351-28</Id><Topic><Title>If a U.S. warship runs aground, the captain is pretty routinely relieved of command</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1350087682308</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 20:21:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>++Just as I've said a number of times.

Those are real lives being effected. Is that the JOB Creators way of using his tax cut? Get real romney supporters get real. Tax rates for the rich are TOO LOW, it's gone too far the other way. It was 91% when Kennedy took office, yes too high, but now it's too low. It isn't that complicated to understand the scam you are being fed about taxes.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1350141041652</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 11:10:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350141382593-36</Id><Topic><Title>Ask yourself why won't someone living on a finance message board posting political messages 16 hrs/day ask themselves, why??</Title><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1350099669462</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 23:41:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a hypocrite LOL!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1350141382593</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-13 11:16:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350141564800-37</Id><Topic><Title>If a U.S. warship runs aground, the captain is pretty routinely relieved of command</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1350087682308</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 20:21:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's right he is in command, and oh yes he did get Bin Laden, being Commander, you sad about it or not, you like it that way or not, it IS that way.

Let’s just stick with the freshest intelligence. In recent months, Benghazi has been the site of several jihadist attacks. The International Red Cross offices there were bombed in May by an al-Qaeda affiliate called the “Imprisoned Omar Abdul Rahman Brigades” — named in honor of the “Blind Sheikh,” whose detention in the U.S., on a life sentence for terrorism convictions, al-Qaeda has repeatedly vowed to avenge.

This was the policy under Bush that took our country from a budget surplus to a budget deficit and failed to sustain a vital growing economy. 2. Only those individuals currently covered by medical insurance should be covered for pre-existing conditions. 3. Competition between the insurance companies will reduce medical costs. Isn’t this what we have today for everyone under the age of 65? Have you premiums gone up and health care improved? 4. The current Social Security system should be changed to allow individuals to invest their retirement funds in the stock market in hopes of getting a higher return. How much money would you have lost if you had sold the stocks in your retirement fund at the bottom of the recession? 5.You believe that higher income earners (those in the top 10%) should pay taxes at lower rate than Warren Buffet’s secretary or the average wage earner. 6. Taxes and regulations, not the lack of demand, were the major cause of the recession. 7. That the banking and financial industry does not need to be regulated. What do you think caused the housing industry to collapse and the banks to need financial aid from the government to survive? 8. Women should be paid less than men for the same job. 9. That the United States should increase its military spending even though the U.S. already spends more on defense than the next 13 countries with the highest defense budgets. 10 That companies are people and should be allowed to make unlimited political contributions without disclosure.
