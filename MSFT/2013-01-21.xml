Anyone who has used it and tested felt its awesomeness. In fact, w8 was awarded 2012 best invention. msft sold 60 million copies in first 10 weeks, price ranging anywhere from $18 to $99/copy. But this is just the promotional period. From Feb 2013 onward, W8 will cost $200/copy. Why such a huge price increase? Well, it must be in huge demand. In order for PC makers to compete in mobile market, they have to be able to include touchpad into their laptops or pc. Lenovo does a great job with W8 and came up with Yoga, priced at $1000. The secret in this huge price increase W8 also has alot to do with competitions. Msft is also turning hardware coming out with Surface Pro which will have W8. Thus, in order to sell Surface Pro well, without facing too many competitions, msft must increase W8 price. Thus, if other PC makers want to build a hybrid laptop/touchpad, they must pay msft $200/copy. Msft got the pc makers hooked on W8 like crack and now increased the price on them, if they want to compete in the hybrid business; otherwise, msft will monopolize the touchpad/laptop hybrid. Thus, all these analysts who claim that msft success depends on the # of W8 sold is completely false to say the least. It depends on whether or not msft wants to monopolize the hybrid business. To price W8 at $200, to me, is to maximize what they can get from competitor PC makers, at the same time keeping the hybrid business to tolerable competition. Bing, which I agree is a copy cat of Google, has been losing money. Thus, this new partnership with FB will bring more visits and popularity that Bing needs. Hence, I expect revenue of Bing will increase. My price target is $50 by summer of 2013.</Msg><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358749535680</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 01:25:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358749997031-2</Id><Title>Very Very Strong SELL</Title><Msg>Dear friends These are few of the problems we have been facing with Microsoft since years, and they have never come up with a solution, instead have always complicated the issue. Even after repeatedly asking for a solution, they have never turned back to fix the issue. Instead they introduce new features as if everything else is fine with their product. which is in other words fooling the small investors, like they fool them while fabricating their balance sheets. So i have finally decided to bring these issues into the notice of small investors in Microsoft through various forums available. here are few of the issues: Contacts not showing online , although they are online ( its almost 3+ years since we have been reporting these issues to microsoft, out of 1000 contacts there are more than 700+ online at a time and 900 + active contacts, but i have never seen more than 120 contacts online till today, earlier in 2005 or so , this feature used to work perfectly, now Microsoft doesn't wish to resolve the issue, instead playing tricks and fooling their investors) Unable to view Friends Profile &amp; Contacts Since August 2012, i'm unable to view my friends Profile &amp; Contacts, like many others. Huge Crowd have reported the same issue to Microsoft but with their same attitude towards their customer base they are once again negligent towards the issue and doesnt wish to resolve it. with skype, i can't sign in with appear offline mode or any other status We can't sign in with proper status on skype, also there are many more issues . It looks like Microsoft is closing down their operations and selling out their customer base to Skype ? Messenger to Yahoo! chat interoperability is no longer supported Earlier they introduced Yahoo Chat Interoperability, now they have closed it fortnightly, thats very strange, do they only work for their Investor? Do we, as a customer have no right to be asked if it would be appropriate to close such a feature without any informatio</Msg><Username>sourabhx25</Username><Timestamp>1358749997031</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 01:33:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358764486186-3</Id><Topic><Title>Very Very Strong SELL</Title><Username>sourabhx25</Username><Timestamp>1358749997031</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 01:33:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"selling out their customer base to Skype ?"

By Mike Gaddy. Published Feb. 28, 2003 The court did not dispute the heart of Akre’s claim, that Fox pressured her to broadcast a false story to protect the broadcaster from having to defend the truth in court, as well as suffer the ire of irate advertisers. Fox argued from the first, and failed on three separate occasions, in front of three different judges, to have the case tossed out on the grounds there is no hard, fast, and written rule against deliberate distortion of the news. The attorneys for Fox, owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch, argued the First Amendment gives broadcasters the right to lie or deliberately distort news reports on the public airwaves. In its six-page written decision, the Court of Appeals held that the Federal Communications Commission position against news distortion is only a “policy,” not a promulgated law, rule, or regulation. Fox aired a report after the ruling saying it was “totally vindicated” by the verdict.</Msg><Username>national_soup_month</Username><Timestamp>1358777459276</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:10:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358777587430-8</Id><Topic><Title>HELP is here...

There are no rightwingers. I've asked many a lyiin liberal what they thought was rightwing about anything a supposed rightwinger says. They can't answer in substance, only attack the messenger. We do know what leftwing is...and it is extreme-ism, and can be identified in substance. Please tell me what you consider as rightwing extremism even in the opinion portion of Fox news, and even on that segment they offer up liberal commentartors to make it fair and balanced. A 2nd Ammendment supporter is a rightwinger? Someone who wants fed govt spending reduced, and the debt reduced? Someone who wants taxes reduced, and hard working folks allowed to keep more of their own money? Get real , that is not extremism.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1358779106653</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:38:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358780118020-12</Id><Topic><Title>stock chart patterns</Title><Username>noemieheilig921</Username><Timestamp>1308490175000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-06-19 09:29:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good job.</Msg><Username>emiwilliam</Username><Timestamp>1358780118020</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 09:55:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358781117343-13</Id><Title>SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND</Title><Msg>Presidential inauguration: 700,000 expected in D.C. to watch Obama take oath of office</Msg><Username>national_soup_month</Username><Timestamp>1358781117343</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 10:11:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358781982149-14</Id><Title>We need to stop wasting all this fresh water...</Title><Msg>Since early december rivers have been swollen in the south due to excessive rainfall.

And a recent report from Bernstein Research analyst Toni Sacconaghi showed that 95% of iOS users intended to stay with it on their next device, 75% of Android users would get Android devices next time, 58% of RIM users would get new Blackberry phones. 37% of wPhone faithful would continue with their current choice.

In other words, MSFT has more growth from now on as compared to GOOG. Now coming back to the basics: GOOG PE ratio is (704.51/45.87) = 15.35 MSFT PE ration is (27.25/3.19) = 8.54 If MSFT starts trading with the same PE ratio then MSFT should be trading 3.19* 15.35 = $48.99. So we could easily see MSFT trading around $50 by end of this year, its almost a double from the current levels.

We've made historic strides since Rosa Parks refused to go to the back of the bus. As a democratic people, we can take pride in the knowledge that we Americans recognized a grave injustice and took action to correct it. And we should remember that in far too many countries, people like Dr. King never have the opportunity to speak out at all. But traces of bigotry still mar America. So, each year on Martin Luther King Day, let us not only recall Dr. King, but rededicate ourselves to the Commandments he believed in and sought to live every day: Thou shall love thy God with all thy heart, and thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. And I just have to believe that all of us—if all of us, young and old, Republicans and Democrats, do all we can to live up to those Commandments, then we will see the day when Dr. King's dream comes true, and in his words, "All of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, '... land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring.'" -Ronald W.

Thanks Ballmer, but time to give it up.</Msg><Username>ezloan2go</Username><Timestamp>1358829126230</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:32:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358829202986-104</Id><Title>David Einhorn</Title><Msg>David - please have Ballmer understand that with a new guy running CEO, his vested shares will do much better. Tell him thank you but it's time to focus on his NBA team and time for someone else to lead MSFT.</Msg><Username>ezloan2go</Username><Timestamp>1358829202986</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:33:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358830175354-105</Id><Topic><Title>How to get ths Start Menu back</Title><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1358825513300</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 22:31:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LINUX RUINED MY MAC..!!</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1358830175354</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 23:49:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
