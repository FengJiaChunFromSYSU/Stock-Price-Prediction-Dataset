Over a year earlier a black man shot a white man in front of the white ma's daughter, cited "stand your ground" and was not charged until the backlash from Zimmerman being charged. In that case the evidence did indicate second degree murder. The white man's offnse? Defending skateboarders and approaching the black man in what the black man considered a threatening manner. The black man likely would have never been charged but for the Zimmerman case, he got manslaughter. Either party has the right to stand. Zimmerman and Martin were within teir rights until the first punch was thrown, that escalated the incident to assault. Legally it doesn't even matter who threw the first punch in the "stand your ground case". When it further escalated to one party having the upper hand in the fight and continuing to the point of the other fearing for his life it was an unfortunate hard lesson for a juvenile mistake. And BTW, idiot, like the 10th time, this was not a "stand your ground" case.

No reason no way no how to kill someone, especially a minor. This jury was a POS, and too bad the holdout didn't hold out. T was on his home turf just like Z. SYG was really meant for that, when someone invades your home. It shouldn't apply anywhere else. What killer tells the truth when no one knows but him, this one obviously didn't.

The only person who knows for certain is Zimmerman and no, it does not cotradict anything known, per the experts the story was consistent and credible, ditto per the jury. They tried to find some reason to convict and there was none. Perps go free every day with tons of real evidence. There is a reason Zimmerman was not initially charged and it has nothig to do with race, it has to do with a lack of evidence to contradict what he claims. Here's another shocker for you, according to the law it makes no difference if Zimmerman struck first (which I strongly doubt). Once Trayvon got the upper hand and didn't let up, as the evidence confirms, then Zimmermen had a right to self defense. Everyone in the know bought Zimmerman's account, and more importantly what independent evidence there was supports his account. Did you utter a single word of complaint when O.J. was set free? Did You rally? Did you attend vigils demanding justice for Nicole? Or are you just the run of the mill racist hypocrit?</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1374429517445</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 13:58:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374430523408-74</Id><Topic><Title>McSOFTY PARTNERSHIP WITH NSA - post removed</Title><Username>hayzeuschrist</Username><Timestamp>1374429209355</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 13:53:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another conspirators theory ? give me a break, if you don't like then don't buy it but don't spread crackpot rumors.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1374430523408</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 14:15:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1374430771435-75</Id><Title>This Stock Looks Oversold</Title><Msg>I think this is a good 1-2 year play for sure.</Msg><Username>vikkitrader</Username><Timestamp>1374430771435</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 14:19:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1374430850970-76</Id><Topic><Title>The combination of smart phone and desktop/laptop is better choice than the tablet IMO</Title><Username>buylosellhi2012</Username><Timestamp>1374420448999</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-21 11:27:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think they can do both, just go back to the OEM model and sell OS, utility and other software updated via the cloud.
