Here is an example of how inflation works: and can be searched on bing. Imagine for a moment that the total money supply in the United States was only $1 Million Dollars. And imagine you owned 10% of it, which is $100,000.00 - that would mean you would be extremely wealthy correct? Now imagine if tomorrow the money supply increased by 10 trillion... how much would your $100,000 be worth in that instance? You would no longer be wealthy. And unfortunately, this has already happened in over 30 other countries in the past 90 years. That in a nut shell is the effect of inflation, and how devastating it can be if the money supply expands rapidly. The dollar has expanded publicly by over $2.68 trillion dollars since 2009 alone. If this aggressive trend continues, imagine how worthless your dollars will become.</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1357309351004</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:22:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357309911913-6</Id><Title>LAST CHNACE TO BUY VUZI at this Level - 100 Bagger</Title><Msg>Check it out</Msg><Username>whattime0000</Username><Timestamp>1357309911913</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:31:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357310112947-7</Id><Topic><Title>CFury has dodged this question for days, he cannot confront it and answer</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1357271399320</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:49:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>anything will post ??</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1357310112947</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 09:35:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357310159469-8</Id><Title>Large Federal spending win for Microsoft</Title><Msg>Microsoft Corporation : U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and DISA Expand Access to Microsoft Technologies Through Cost-Saving Modernization Agreement 01/04/2013| 09:05am US/Eastern WASHINGTON, Jan. 4, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- In an effort to modernize technology infrastructure, reduce costs and foster new levels of cross-agency collaboration, the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) are expanding access to Microsoft solutions by entering into a transformative three-year Joint Enterprise Licensing Agreement for enterprise licenses and software assurance.

There are millions of Obama supporters in better league than you This is just another years old election talking point you drug up to enable yourself another flury of Obama bashing. For me I have work at hand to do and could care less about this. Demand causes inflation. Why do you think we intrude on cfury's right to post or not post, and care. That's the title of your revelation here, who cares, it's his business. Quote from Forbes article by Harvey: "It is conventional wisdom that printing more money causes inflation. This is why we are seeing so many warnings today of how Quantitative Easing I and II and the federal government’s deficit are about to lead to skyrocketing prices. The only problem is, it’s not true. That’s not how inflation works. Hence, this is yet another of the false alarms being raised (along with the need to balance the budget) that is preventing us from doing what we need to do to recover from the worse recession since the Great Depression. Explaining inflation would be much simpler if not for the need to first spend so much time debunking the popular view. But, that’s the way it is. And so, let me start with the “money growth == inflation” view. This is based on the equation of exchange: MV = Py where M is equal to the supply of money, V the velocity of money (or the average number of times each dollar bill is spent), P the average price of goods and services, and y the total quantity of all goods and services sold during the time period in question. Thus, if there were 100 goods and services that sold for $10 each (on average), then that means a total of $1000-worth of transactions took place. Were there 200 one-dollar bills in this economy, then it must be that each was used 5 times (hence the “velocity” of money, or how fast they were spent again). MV = Py 200 x 5 = 10 x 100 It is important to note here that the above is not the least bit controversial. No economist disagrees with the basic equation MV=Py. The arguments arise when additional assumptions are made regarding the nature of the individual variables. For example, this is what is assumed in the “money growth== inflation” view: “ M: That which is money is easily defined and identified and only the central bank can affect it’s supply, which it can do with autonomy and precision. V: The velocity of money is related to people’s habits and the structure of the financial system. It is, therefore, relatively constant. P: The economy is so competitive that neither firms nor workers are free to change what they charge for their goods and services without there having been a change in the underlying forces driving supply and demand in their market. y: The economy automatically tends towards full employment and thus y (the existing volume of goods and services) is as large as it can be at any given moment (although it grows over time). Now let’s go through an example, recalling the mathematical example from above: MV = Py 200 x 5 = 10 x 100 Consider the assumptions made regarding each of the variables. P can’t change on it’s own, y is already as large as it can possibly be given current technology and resources, and V is constant. Only M can change in the short run and it must therefore logically be the starting point of any fluctuation we introduce. Furthermore, according to our assumptions, the central bank has the power to (for example) double the money supply at will. In Milton Friedman’s example from “The Optimum Quantity of Money,” a helicopter is used to accomplish this. Now what happens?"</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1357312681512</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 10:18:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357312899577-16</Id><Topic><Title>CFury has dodged this question for days, he cannot confront it and answer</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1357271399320</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:49:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"He's like a patient in the psychiatrist's office as the doctor tries to get his patient to face his demons."

After earnings you can pick this up below $26 EASY - probably far below.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1357318816455</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:00:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357318964939-32</Id><Topic><Title>The idea of spending your way to success as opposed to creating wealth to prosperity</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1356310665083</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-23 19:57:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hawcreek12, you seem to be supporting Obama, that's smart. He is not for spending, that was an empty election theme against him. He is a conservative, logical, and sees the solution coming from every possibility. I always said he was a conservative man, and it surprises me how conservative he is sometimes. I would say of the two last Pres candidudes , Obama would be less of a spender. Romney would just be another good ol GWB spender because it is easy, and the repubs would sign everything, as long as their bank accounts get that tax cut. The right keeps bringing up these old election theme songs which were false then, and thinks somehow they stick better now. No, they don't stick better now.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1357318964939</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:02:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357319483760-33</Id><Topic><Title>CFury has dodged this question for days, he cannot confront it and answer</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1357271399320</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 22:49:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wikipedia definition of inflation' ""In economics, inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of goods and services i""</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1357319483760</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:11:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357319612125-34</Id><Topic><Title>Good news everyone !

It's important because it reveals how totally out of his league he is while discussing any monetary policy, as are all Obama supporters. In 1932 an ounce of gold was worth slightly more than $20 an ounce and it had been the same for many years. Then one could take a $20 Greenback bill to the treasury and exchange it for a $20 Double Eagle that contained about 0.97 ounces. Today it takes roughly 85 of those $20 bills to acquire the same coin. The actual coin can still buy as much or more than it could in 1932 in likewise limited commodities like real estate. 8500% inflation in 80 years for printed play money, and Obama is financing a significant portion of the debt with the printing presses rather than borrowing. IMO hyper inflation coming at some point. } I says So what, sometimes in the past there has been labor demand and wages rose up as a consequence. You could try explaining again how printed money taken up by the investor class automatically puts it into general circulation when it is well understood that they actually invest in driving assets higher. Inflation cannot occur without consumer demand. I gave you a Forbes article to explain it. It is important because it reveals how the RWNJ accepts as unconditional the theories he is fed and takes them without a shred of critical thinking.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1357320137639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:22:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357320860446-38</Id><Title>Windows 8.

It takes me twice as long to do the same things that I could do faster back from Windows 98. Almost like Windows 8 was made for tablet PC or phone. I doesn't seem made to run on a laptop or desktop. How will anyone get any work done? There are somethings I like but just wish that childish tile screen would go. Apps on a laptop/PC, are they kidding? My own computer is trying to sell me junk and I just want to work. The desktop screen without the start button is a hard to use and takes more time than the OS of over a decade ago. There was little wrong with Windows 7 unlike VISTA or ME. So what is the deal? Heck, I think the silly thing asked me to "tap here" when installing software. Tap what? LOL! Even if I had a touch screen the mouse would still be faster and is wireless. This is like technology going in reverse. At lease the mouse still works. They really need two versions of this OS but frankly I am not sure the full version could run on or compete with Apple for mobile devices. I think just like ME if this doesn't work out they will leave consumers holding the bag. Anyone remember windows 2000 Pro? I could run that with 16-32 megs.

In modern economies, relatively little of the supply of broad money is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010 in the U.S., of the $8853.4 billion in broad money supply (M2), only $915.7 billion (about 10%) consisted of physical coins and paper money.[2] The manufacturing of new physical money is usually the responsibility of the central bank, or sometimes, the government's treasury. Contrary to popular belief, money creation in a modern economy does not directly involve the manufacturing of new physical money, such as paper currency or metal coins. Instead, when the central bank expands the money supply through open market operations (e.g. by purchasing government bonds), it credits the accounts that commercial banks hold at the central bank (termed high powered money). Commercial banks may draw on these accounts to withdraw physical money from the central bank. Commercial banks may also return soiled or spoiled currency to the central bank in exchange for new currency</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1357322330470</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 12:58:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357322411584-46</Id><Title>Bernstein at 38, Most analysts at 34.

I have been to a few msft stores and I saw with my own eyes before I started investing in msft. I saw people buying surface like the hottest thing in the market, the same crowd as apple store. Future: Surface Pro releasing in sometimes this month shoud be a better version of Surface, this should sell even better. The new Xbox is comming out this June.

As part of a new cloud computing strategy, Mayor Rahm Emanuel today announced that the City of Chicago will move 30,000 employees to Microsoft Office 365 for cloud-based e-mail and productivity. The City will consolidate its three disparate e-mail systems into one Microsoft Office 365 environment in an effort to improve collaboration, enhance security, and provide both mobile and desktop access for anytime, anywhere productivity. This new strategy will deliver more than $1.3 million in cost savings over the next four years – a whopping 80 percent decrease in cost per employee – while ensuring City workers have access to Web-based versions of the Microsoft tools they rely upon every day, including Microsoft Outlook, Word, OneNote, Excel, Lync and PowerPoint. Today, Chicago joins a rapidly growing list of state and local government customers that are taking advantage of the cost savings and efficiency benefits of moving to the cloud with Microsoft, including the City of San Francisco, the State of California and the State of Minnesota. To learn more about today’s news and what it means for Chicago, here is a link to the City’s press release.</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1357330545516</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 15:15:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357330718154-78</Id><Topic><Title>Silver lining for longs...</Title><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1357328222769</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 14:37:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only silver lining is the Yhoo Ignore button for POS trash like you.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1357330718154</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 15:18:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357330843170-79</Id><Title>TIC TOC and watch MSFT go up, SAY OH NO UP we go</Title><Msg>TIC TOC and watch MSFT go up, SAY OH NO UP we go</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357330843170</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 15:20:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357331110355-80</Id><Topic><Title>City of Chicago goes with MS Office365..interesting.

Depends on how you look at it. Some see Apple and google stealing from Msft because of mobile devices but the way I see it is that Msft never had mobile devices. Now Windows 8 allows them to still make PC BUT attach mobile devices to the laptops or desktops. Hence Msft is actually stealing business that they never had in the first place. Apple is already threatened by surface by making smaller ipads and lowering the price to remain competitive against Surface and other smaller touchpads. Apple stock price is already suffering the threat of msft. So, all these #$%$ articles about how Surface isn't doing well and google/apple are attacking msft business core is full of #$%$. First of all, no one can use any of these toys (ipads and phones) to do real work. You still need a laptop and desktops to do real work. How is it that Google and Apple stealing business from msft? Now that Surface like devices are introduced into the market, who is really stealing from who?

Company officials, notably including new Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields, promise still more aid to come for the long-beleaguered Detroit. GM has steadily increased its involvement in community affairs; at one event last year, Chevrolet General Marketing Manager Chris Perry washed the feet of some young inner city children and helped them find new shoes donated by the Samaritan’s Feet charity. Chrysler, meanwhile, has taken several floors of space in one of Quicken’s new downtown buildings – recently renamed Chrysler House – and kicked in cash and manpower for other community projects. ***************************************************************************************************** Koch Industries was sued by the government in 1995 and 1997 as a result of a reported 300 oil spills from pipelines that they owned and operated.

This is an interesting fact, particularly amid the Democrats' feverish push to ban many different rifles, ostensibly to keep us safe of course. However, it appears the zeal of Sens. like Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) is misdirected. For in looking at the FBI numbers from 2005 to 2011, the number of murders by hammers and clubs consistently exceeds the number of murders committed with a rifle. Think about it: In 2005, the number of murders committed with a rifle was 445, while the number of murders committed with hammers and clubs was 605. In 2006, the number of murders committed with a rifle was 438, while the number of murders committed with hammers and clubs was 618. And so the list goes, with the actual numbers changing somewhat from year to year, yet the fact that more people are killed with blunt objects each year remains constant. For example, in 2011, there was 323 murders committed with a rifle but 496 murders committed with hammers and clubs. While the FBI makes is clear that some of the "murder by rifle" numbers could be adjusted up slightly, when you take into account murders with non-categorized types of guns, it does not change the fact that their annual reports consistently show more lives are taken each year with these blunt objects than are taken with Feinstein's dreaded rifle. Another interesting fact: According to the FBI, nearly twice as many people are killed by hands and fists each year than are killed by murderers who use rifles.</Msg><Username>cramerblows_a_s_s</Username><Timestamp>1357361062416</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-04 23:44:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
