The two were ecstatic at the fabulous win, and gave each other a high five, that morphed into a lingering clasp of mingled fingers, until they realized the people around them uncomfortably noticing the magic moment. Best of all, Christie won Barry a cute cuddly teddy bear. Some reports say the two followed up with building sand castles on the beach, a frolic in the water with their pants rolled up splashing each other playfully, and then sharing a slice of cheesecake al fresco at a quaint area bistro.

Shulman's predecessor, who served from 2003 to 2007, visited the Bush White House only once during his four-year tenure. Commentary Magazine asks the one pertinent question that will be ultimately answered by a weak link in the Obama regime chain that will refuse to go to federal prison for The One: "The Commissioner of Internal Revenue is a managerial position, not a policy-making one, although his input on the practical realities of tax collection and how the IRS is structured might well be very useful if the President was planning a big push on tax reform. But no such push has been forthcoming. Obama’s sole interest in the tax code has been to raise rates on high earners. So what was the commissioner doing going to the White House more than once a week on average?"</Msg><Username>plmartin02</Username><Timestamp>1369837370544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 10:22:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369837412473-38</Id><Topic><Title>Lying Koch Sycophants On This Board Slandering A Good Honest Man</Title><Username>rightwing_fukery_hurts_usa</Username><Timestamp>1369787459850</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 20:30:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You left out the middle of the sentence and changed the meaning.

Three dots says something not germane to the point was omitted from the quote. You said Obama works twice as hard, which I find laughable, he doesn't, he's apparently quite lazy, even his own party members think so. That is one thought and it is not germane to the point I made. You also said Obama is used to less respect. That is a totally unique thought which, if true, has a fundamental cause driving it. My view is his corruption, constant lying, total lack of loyalty, anti-American views of the Constitution earn him less respect, and deservedly so.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1369841510332</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 11:31:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369841702001-54</Id><Title>Wild Price Swings</Title><Msg>We're beginning to act like a growth stock.

You generalize constantly with your two dimensional way of thinking and wind up with a black and white world view. There are few pure liberals and few pure conservatives. Everyone has exceptions to their professed philosophies. How many times have we seen an otherwise conservative or liberal politician go against the grain or change stance due to gay offspring or the like? "Mary Claire Cheney (born March 14, 1969) is the second daughter of #$%$ Cheney, the former Vice President of the United States, and his wife, Lynne Cheney. She is openly lesbian, has voiced support for same-sex marriage, and has been credited with encouraging her father to support same-sex marriage.[1] In 2013, Cheney was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[2]" There are plenty of examples of these kinds of deviations from expressed beliefs. How about Senator Rob Portman? "I'm announcing today a change of heart on an issue that a lot of people feel strongly about that has to do with gay couples' opportunity to marry," Portman told CNN. "I've come to the conclusion that for me, personally, I think this is something that we should allow people to do, to get married, and to have the joy and stability of marriage that I've had for over 26 years. That I want all of my children to have, including our son, who is gay," said Portman." Your stifled view doesn't allow for middle of the road people such as those that may have highly conservative views regarding fiscal policy while maintaining a liberal view on gun control for instance. Your reasoning is fallacious. Any Psych 101 student would be quick to point that out whether whether liberal or conservative.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1369846564816</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 12:56:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369846819145-75</Id><Topic><Title>There is no god.

SO that is why the real estate and stocks are up and that the Fed can wait till Maturity to get the money back or simply it issues short term Bonds to collect back the money they put in the market.... THE main issue with your paymaster is that the interest rates are at zero and they can not lend money to the USG at 5-10% without taking any risk and as the economy improves and the budget deficit shrinks, the USG will borrow less and put more downward pressure on the interest rates and that really is why they are crying wolf and are paying you so to mislead and confuse the public.

He never after, during the eight hours when our guys have their lives in danger, he never called the Secretary of Defense, he never calls the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he never calls the CIA Director,” Krauthammer continued. “Who does he call? About five hours in he calls the Secretary of State. And after the phone call she releases a statement essentially about the video and how we denounce any intolerance. It looks as if the only phone call was to construct a cover story at a time when the last two Americans who died were still alive and fighting for their lives. There’s the scandal and that has to be uncovered.”</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1369855195420</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:19:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369855209114-112</Id><Title>Nokia &amp; Microsoft adds</Title><Msg>Nokia upped TV adds this quarter and the results have already proven to have boost the US Windows phone market.

That statement was made at the same time that top Democrats, including President Obama himself, were demonizing Charles and David Koch, the owners of Koch Industries, for giving money to Tea Party groups. Goolsbee's remark led to a federal investigation, the results of which have never been released. goolsbee In a September 2010 WEEKLY STANDARD interview, Mark Holden, a lawyer for Koch Industries, disputed Goolsbee's claim and asked how Goolsbee came up with the idea that Koch Industries doesn't pay corporate taxes. Holden raised the question of whether someone in the Obama administration might have looked at Koch Industries' tax returns--which would be a violation of a federal law that was enacted in 1976 in response to Watergate.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1369859477130</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 16:31:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369860220160-134</Id><Title>Left Wing also are more concerned about maintaing S.S. and Medicare for themselves</Title><Msg>than reforming those programs for sustainability.

Paraphrase; waaaa, oh yeah, waaaaaaaa. The Seals are tools and have been around a long time. The General, the Commander in Chief, used his Seal tools to kill OBL, without the General using his tools, no kill. It always works that way, and this time as well. No Obama does not have to kill two or three OBL;s to get credit for one. He directly made the decisions that worked, starting day one. Because he is focused not on himself or politics, but the problem. That's why he and his Bro Christy can be in opposite camps, yet get along and be Bro's and solve problems in the interest of the people. It is something being seen now as correct, and the tea party doesn't like it.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1369875712150</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 21:01:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369875769313-178</Id><Title>Obama promised to get OBL, instead the SEALS trained under Bush used info gained under Bush</Title><Msg>while Obama probably wet himself just listening.
