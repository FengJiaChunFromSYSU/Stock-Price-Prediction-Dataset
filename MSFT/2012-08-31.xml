Samsung isn’t the only company considering the patents; Apple and Google along with a number of other potential buyers are also in the race, according to sources that preferred to remain anonymous due to the private nature of the talks. Some of the mobile technologies used in high speed mobile phone networks by the largest handset manufacturers across the world were invented by the engineers of InterDigital. The company based in Pennsylvania could earn more than $4 billion from the patent sale, said analysts. If the South Korea based Samsung makes a bid, it will have to compete with Google and Apple for purchasing the whole or a part of the portfolio which contains more than 8,800 patents concerning technologies used in smartphones which range from the Android based smartphones to the iPhone and RIM’s BlackBerry line of handsets. It has been forecast that sales of smartphones are going to triple by 2015, according to Gartner Inc. Lee Seung Woo, an analyst based in Seoul, said that there are a lot of important patents which belong to the InterDigital portfolio and as the fight between Samsung and Apple heats up, Samsung can’t afford Apple to get the assets. Thus for reducing the risk on itself, Samsung will have to go ahead and bid, even if it costs them a huge premium.

I think I have done so, mostly in jest. He is not, per se, he does have near perfect Marxist thinking though, as trained by Ayers and the like. He thinks "the worker" built it all, and the business owner merely a greedy skimmer. There are bad owners and bad, greedy employees. For the good ones in each group, who are the great majority, it is symbiotic. Spin it as you will, his comment was a slip, like the "spread the wealth around" slip and revealed his true thinking. We need someone who understands how America works, not someone trying to "fundamentally reshape America " in a now failed experiment. He said give him three years and time is up.

By Patch Staff Email the author 4:30 am Email Print 48 Comments Upload Photos and Videos Dunwoody Democrats have a chance to see President Barack Obama's acceptance speech in person at next week's Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, NC. The DeKalb Democratic Party sent out this message Thursday night. DO YOU WANT TO GO TO CHARLOTTE AND BE THERE IN PERSON FOR THE PRESIDENTS"S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH? In Atlanta: Manuel's Tavern, 602 N Highland Avenue NE, Atlanta, GA 30307 In Macon: Bibb County Democratic Party, 835 Forsyth St. Suite A, Macon GA 31201 Here's the rules: Everyone who is at Manuel's Tavern or the Bibb County Democratic Party by noon is eligible for two tickets. Arrive early if you want, but it won't give you a better chance to win. Just be there by 12 noon! If less than 50 people arrive, everyone will get a pair! If more than 50 folks arrive, we will do a random drawing to determine our winners. There is no cost involved. We're not selling the tickets, we're giving them away. Since we're not selling tickets, you can't sell them either! If you sell your tickets to someone else, they will be deactivated. For planning purposes, we expect that President Obama will speak at 8pm on Thursday. To insure that you are in your seat for the speech, you should arrive at the stadium that afternoon. There will be strict security at the event. Your trip to Charlotte to see the President's historic speech begins tomorrow.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346420824667</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:47:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346422452517-32</Id><Topic><Title>AFTER LISTENING TO ROMNEY, WE'VE DECIDED our 401K IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER</Title><Username>c.luke44</Username><Timestamp>1346419451686</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:24:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, and I'm afraid he might go after my jar of peanut butter too.</Msg><Username>opticash</Username><Timestamp>1346422452517</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:14:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346423313492-33</Id><Topic><Title>I think Obama would be better than Romney</Title><Username>watkinsdavidrobert</Username><Timestamp>1346419907804</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 09:31:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey English challenged moe-ron, your != you're</Msg><Username>watkinsdavidrobert</Username><Timestamp>1346423313492</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:28:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346423720219-34</Id><Topic><Title>Rising stars</Title><Username>harrydokes</Username><Timestamp>1346421982257</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:06:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rubio, Panenty, Walker, Paul Ryan, Bobby Jindel Hess, Goering, Himmler, Goebbels, ... notice the similarities</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1346423720219</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:35:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346423732424-35</Id><Topic><Title>Clint Eastwood</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1346415299006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 08:14:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>clint can relate real well to our city....whites, blacks, hispanics...the real growing america..i don't think so...not the america of rich old white guys..the gop.....</Msg><Username>hwardeinhorn</Username><Timestamp>1346423732424</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 10:35:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346424612970-36</Id><Topic><Title>Clint Eastwood</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1346415299006</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 08:14:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yes they did help and no "we" don't dislike success.

The Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahronot headlined its Friday paper “The Confrontation” with a photo of Netanyahu on one side and President Obama alongside U.S. ambassador to Israel, Dan Shapiro, on the other. Veteran diplomatic correspondent Shimon Schiffer reports that during a private meeting last week, Netanyahu very undiplomatically attacked Obama and his advisers over what he views as their ineffective Iran policy. The incident took place when Republican congressman and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers visited Netanyahu’s office for an Iran briefing, accompanied by the U.S. ambassador to Israel. Schiffer reports (translated via hard copy by TheBlaze in Israel): Netanyahu, according to a source who participated in the meeting, was particularly surly and stressed. At the start of the meeting, he opened with a sharp attack on the Obama administration which according to him has not done enough on the Iranian issue. “Instead of effectively pressuring Iran, Obama and his people are pressuring us not to attack the nuclear facilities,” he said, and then moved on to a harsh criticism of the administration’s pronouncements indicating there is still room for diplomacy. “The time has run out,” he said resolutely. At one point, an anomalous thing occurred in the office, which is very unacceptable in diplomatic code. Ambassador Shapiro who was appointed by President Obama and for years was among his closest advisers decided he’d had enough. Enough is enough. He spoke and answered Netanyahu politely but in a manner that left no room for doubt. The ambassador in fact accused Netanyahu of distorting Obama’s position. He quoted the president, who promised he would not allow a nuclear Iran and said that all options – including a military strike – are on the table […] Diplomatic sources who were privy to the incident say that “lightning and sparks flew” in the room, and that the exchange of words became more harsh. The U.S. embassy wouldn’t comment to the Yediot correspondent, and TheBlaze has not independently confirmed the story’s accuracy. Meanwhile, Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey voiced his strongest opposition to date to any unilateral Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear plants. He told reporters in London: “I don’t want to be complicit if they [Israel] choose to do it.” The Guardian reports: Distancing himself from any Israeli plan to bomb Iran, Dempsey said such an attack would “clearly delay but probably not destroy Iran’s nuclear programme”. He added: “I don’t want to be complicit if they [Israel] choose to do it.” Dempsey said he did not know Iran’s nuclear intentions, as intelligence did not reveal intentions. What was clear, he said, was that the “international coalition” applying pressure on Iran “could be undone if [Iran] was attacked prematurely”. Sanctions against Iran were having an effect, and they should be given a reasonable opportunity to succeed. For now it appears Iran’s nuclear march proceeds unabated by sanctions and diplomacy, as reflected in the most recent International Atomic Energy Agency report. According to the IAEA’s latest quarterly report, Iran has more than doubled the number of centrifuges it has in its underground Fordo bunker, vastly increasing its uranium enrichment capacity.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346429272279</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 12:07:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346434267954-44</Id><Topic><Title>Why Did Microsoft Invest In Barnes &amp; Noble?</Title><Username>Neil_Hollands_Uncle</Username><Timestamp>1336414493000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-05-07 14:14:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because MSFT needed a backdoor to get into the tablet side of the business.

In March 2012, Idaho State Senator Chuck Winder said, “I would hope that when a woman goes in to a physician with a rape issue, that physician will indeed ask her about perhaps her marriage, was this pregnancy caused by normal relations in a marriage or was it truly caused by a rape.” Pennsylvania Senate candidate Tom Smith recently said that his daughter faced “something similar” to the situation of a pregnant rape victim because she decided to have a baby “out of wedlock.” And Iowa Representative Steve King remarked that he’d never heard of a girl getting pregnant from rape. Should your magical uterus fail you, Mike Huckabee supports carrying your rapist’s baby: “Even from those horrible, horrible tragedies of rape, which are inexcusable and indefensible, life has come and sometimes, you know, those people are able to do extraordinary things.” Well, who says they aren’t? The issue is whether the woman should be forced by law to bear her rapist’s wonder tot. Paul Ryan and Todd Akin wanted to restrict coverage of abortion to victims of “forcible rape” in their version of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, sponsored by 217 Republicans (and, sadly, ten Democrats). In the wake of Akin, Ryan has defended the term as “stock language.” John Willke, the mad physician who founded the National Right to Life Committee, has been denying that rape causes pregnancy for decades (“the tubes are spastic,” he recently explained to the New York Times). Romney welcomed Willke’s endorsement in 2008 (“I am proud to have the support of a man who has meant so much to the pro-life movement in our country”). Willke says they met last October and that Romney assured him they agree on “almost everything.”</Msg><Username>rodwade40</Username><Timestamp>1346461136129</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 20:58:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346462362643-90</Id><Topic><Title>Women</Title><Username>therwnjneedhelp</Username><Timestamp>1346460929299</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 20:55:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Two more Obamanurist rags !</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346462362643</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 21:19:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346462951594-91</Id><Title>NOW = Nasty Obamanurist Women</Title><Msg>What a bunch of Obamanure rags!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346462951594</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-31 21:29:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346463158955-92</Id><Title>Can't wait for the Obamanure to flow next week!</Title><Msg>Getting my boots and shovel on Labor day.
