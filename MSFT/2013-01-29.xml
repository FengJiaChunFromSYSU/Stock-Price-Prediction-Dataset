Take randomly selected 100 year slices from the preindustrial period of the 1000 year reconstructions and add this 'noise' to the model. Do this for many slices to form an ensemble of realizations and many would show the flattening of the last 20 years despite the model prediction alone not flattening. There would also be many ensembles that produced excessive warming in the last 20 years. None of the ensembles would suppress the model results entirely over the 100 year industrial span.

Its “Windows and Windows Live” division, which reported a 24% year-over-year increase in revenue in the most recent quarter, will grow by leaps and bounds, because no other operating system will have the ability to integrate hundreds of millions of devices apart from Windows. With the pervasive nature of Windows, which has become even stronger with Windows 8, Microsoft will be in a commanding position. The “Server &amp; Tools” business should also register impressive growth, with networking being the backbone of the Internet of Things. SQL Server and System Center sales will contribute more to Microsoft’s overall revenue growth. The Bottom Line Windows 8 will succeed, and I feel it will help Microsoft regain its market share in the overall OS business, from desktop computing to mobile computing. Once that is done, Microsoft will be firing all cylinders in software.</Msg><Username>don_deal2000</Username><Timestamp>1359491883871</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 15:38:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359491933667-42</Id><Title>SCHS STOCK IS GOING TO BE UP HUGE THIS WEEK GET IN NOW!!!!</Title><Msg>Schs you want to make alot of money this week buy this stock right now!!!!</Msg><Username>basher_killer_2010</Username><Timestamp>1359491933667</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 15:38:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359494316355-43</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's New Surface Tablet Is A Horrible Value</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1359488990024</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 14:49:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm looking forward to buying the Surface Pro. Price is not a concern as long as I can open programs using flash and other programs using Java that the Ipad and Kindle Fire hd can not. I don't mind paying extra just for that alone. At first the Surface Pro is not for the masses but soon will be as all the other tablet makers produce similar products thus bringing the price down. Then the choice will be do you want an Apple or Microsoft based tablet. In year or so it will be Android who, what's that? Android will be phased out or combined with Microsoft to compete with Apple.
