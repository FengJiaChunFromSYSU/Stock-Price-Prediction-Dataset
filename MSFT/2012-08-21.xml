"“We enthusiastically endorse Governor Mitt Romney’s economic plan to create jobs and restore economic growth while returning America to its tradition of economic freedom,” Economists for Romney’s statement of support reads, proclaiming Romney’s plan as based on “proven principles” to restrain the federal government and expand opportunities in the private sector. The 526 economists — including Nobel laureates Gary Becker, Robert Lucas, Robert Mundell, Edward Prescott, and Myron Scholes — point to six facets of Romney’s economic approach that they see as beneficial to future economic success. Reduce marginal tax rates on business and wage incomes and broaden the tax base to increase investment, jobs, and living standards. End the exploding federal debt by controlling the growth of spending so federal spending does not exceed 20 percent of the economy. Restructure regulation to end “too big to fail,” improve credit availability to entrepreneurs and small businesses, and increase regulatory accountability, and ensure that all regulations pass rigorous benefit-cost tests. Improve our Social Security and Medicare programs by reducing their growth to sustainable levels, ensuring their viability over the long term, and protecting those in or near retirement. Reform our healthcare system to harness market forces and thereby reduce costs and increase quality, empowering patients and doctors, rather than the federal bureaucracy. Promote energy policies that increase domestic production, enlarge the use of all western hemisphere resources, encourage the use of new technologies, end wasteful subsidies, and rely more on market forces and less on government planners. Seven of the signatories are from Harvard University and five from Columbia University — two of President Barack Obama’s alma maters." http://dailycaller.com/2012/08/20/more-than-500-economists-5-nobel-laureates-back-romneys-economic-strategy/</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1345524586000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 00:49:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345529097000-6</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Released 10 Years Of Tax Returns</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1345510376000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 20:52:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He has filed 1040NR</Msg><Username>notahchort</Username><Timestamp>1345529097000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 02:04:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345543654000-7</Id><Topic><Title>Romney hasn't released two years worth of tax returns.</Title><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345508310000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 20:18:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>in exchange for compensation that would otherwise be forfeit is called "employment".

This is not a passive investment vehicle; either it explicitly requires Mitt Romney to "perform services" on its behalf, exactly as he's stated in his filing or Mitt Romney is lying once again. Is he still obligated to provide services for Bain? Will he be "providing services" to Bain Capital if elected and instead of working for the People of the United States? Will he file another amendment to his financial disclosures to clarify his activities on behalf of two Bain partnerships?

Infanticide is murdering a baby who is no longer in the womb. There is no essential difference between the two, they are both murder, but one is legal and the other is illegal. Obama supports both. Most people in this world recognize that abortion and infanticide are murder, great sins against nature.

The President of the United States is/was talking about cases such as these: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anencephalic http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlCGRbQELNs Life expectancy: About 7% die during the pregnancy (prenatal death), 20% die during delivery; 50% have a life expectancy of between a few minutes and 1 day, 23% live more than 1 day (Jaquier 2006).

On the one hand C# is generally recognized as the enterprise language with most modern and expressive features available today and C# has shown more downward trends in the past and always recovered from this. But, Microsoft announced recently the revival of C++ (in favor of C#) within its company. C# appeared to be too high level to build high performance systems. This is confirmed by what we see happening to TIOBE's embedded software customers: after years of enthusiastic adoption of C#, there is now no significant growth any more.

Therein lies the pivotal fly in the disturbed and distorted ointment of the ghosananons, reasonablemes, and harrydokes that preach their sewage on this and other discussion forums. The rank hypocrisy of interjecting their religious dogma and/or political convictions into matters in which they have NO personal stake and for which they have neither personal responsibility nor obligation to deal with the lifelong sorrow and aftermath of, creates a stench of holier than thou self righteousness that sickens the senses of all logical, rational and intelligent persons. They are quite happy telling everyone else how to live and think in complete disregard of the fact that their puritanical fanatic mores started to go the way of the dodo bird during or before the 19th century. Things are the way they are now because it is the will of the people that they be so. Yet all these little Adolfs insist on goosestepping around tilting at windmills that spin perpetually and relentlessly on into the future utterly beyond their control, hurling hatred, contempt and vitriol three hundred sixty degrees as they go.

That is a deduction that strongly favors the wealthy and should be abolished.</Msg><Username>infactidoknowitall</Username><Timestamp>1345572600000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 14:10:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345572673000-96</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 belongs on older PCs like a fish needs a bicycle</Title><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1345564348000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 11:52:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Quoting a little more: "Here's the real point.

Rep. Kerry Gauthier, 56, hasn't been charged in the July incident, and authorities said he wouldn't be because the boy was older than 16, the legal age of consent, and no money was exchanged. Police say the teenager responded to the lawmaker's Craigslist ad for "no strings attached" sex. Gauthier admitted to the liaison, according to police reports made public late last week. The teen told police the two had oral sex, according to the reports. The scandal has hurt Democrats' hopes of retaking at least one chamber of the Legislature. They need to pick up at least six seats in the House, and Gauthier's Duluth-area seat is usually reliably Democratic. But if he drops out, any Democrat seeking to replace him would have to run as a write-in candidate, making the race much more difficult to win.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1345580352000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 16:19:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345580619000-126</Id><Topic><Title>I just luv how the media exposes RWNJ at every turn</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1345490423000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 15:20:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;He apparently cannot understand that reporting some facts and not others implies bias.&gt; I don't understand that because it's not true. &lt;Very very rarely is a story factually incorrect...&gt; On the contrary, my experience has been that when a news story is about a matter of which I have direct, independent knowledge, it is ALMOST ALWAYS factually incorrect.

Do follow the link... http://seekingalpha.com/article/820721-microsoft-windows-8-release-yawn?source=yahoo Microsoft Windows 8 Release: Yawn August 21, 2012 | about: MSFT Kofi Bofah On October 26, Microsoft (MSFT) will release its much-anticipated Windows 8 operating system. Yet again, Microsoft's marketing machine is running full throttle to infiltrate the technology conversation with pomp, bombast, and outright propaganda. Microsoft fan boys, of course, will have us believe that Windows 8 will completely revolutionize the personal computer, tablet, and smart phone consumer electronics markets. Meanwhile, devoted Microsoft shareholders bide their time for a product that finally takes this beta investment "Back to the Future" as a story stock. Yawn. For more than one decade, we have sputtered along the Microsoft Bridge to Nowhere. Investors are shackled to a corporate culture that mimics ingenuity, instead of creating artistry. On par with a lumbering giant, Microsoft stock has done little, besides pay out regular dividends and track the S&amp;P 500 Index over the past ten years. Unfortunately for shareholders, the modus operandi at Redmond remains to throw cash at hot sectors, while hawking Windows updates to the public every other year. If anything, Microsoft is pitching itself as the poor man's version of Apple (AAPL).</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345584469000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 17:27:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345584656000-140</Id><Topic><Title>I just luv how the media exposes RWNJ at every turn</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1345490423000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-20 15:20:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are probably one of those people who find that an error like 1 second off on a reported time of an event, or the wrong city for a persons great grandmother makes the story factually incorrect.

I see Goog hype on Msn. I guess I dont blame them for that. I hate MSN too. I dont think Msft knows how to mount a marketing campaign and mostly it doesnt matter anymore. They had ten years to get it together and apparently just couldnt figure out how. The products are pretty good but they dont know how to sell anything outside of business systems and now thats being effected as well. Now Gates is "rediscovering the toilet". I dont want to touch that line, its just too easy.

Mitt Romney, acting through his "blind trust" has filed a form allegedly in compliance with Federal law, this federal law in particular: http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/83 The "election" taken under section 83(b) specifies that the property received by the elector be received in exchange for services rendered. Mitt Romney, operating as his "blind trust" has stated by his attorney that he has excersized the option to receive goods (the vestment of restricted stock as co-founder in a pair of newly instituted Partnerships organized within Bain Capital) the vestment of which will occurr conditionally on the basis of Mitt Romney, operating as his "blind trust" maintaining a "service provider" relationship with the constituted Bain entities and which will otherwise be forfeit. It's not absolutely necessary that that be the specific restriction that triggered the election, but Mitt Romney acting through his "blind trust" has made a swearing through his attorney that that is the case in the two instances covered by the filings, so it is true. It's really not rocket science, like the obligor / obligee relationship that you don't have the financial background to expound on; but its legality as a tax dodge (fixing the value of "compensation" received as regular income at an early date and low notional value so that accrual of future value through the vestment intervals can be treated as capital gains and the disposal of the resultant goods can be immediate, rather than subsequent to the capital gains waiting period) may not be entirely "Kosher" as some might put it. More to the point, Mitt Romney, acting as his "blind trust' for the purposes of his eternal (and often boring) candidacies for State and Federal offices is not necessarily acting within the law by receiving what he's declaring as ordinary goods received as income in compensation for his "blind trust's" services. This would not be a problem if Mitt Romney, whether as his "blind trust" or not provided capital for investment on no condition by some Bain Capitla entity and took his profit or loss on that investment without regard for the actions of the partner or partners who managed the investment.

Meanwhile our liberal non-news media would rather talk about "legitimate rape!" Hey, when Bush was President we had a list of the soldiers killed today, every day. When was the last time you even heard the Afghan war dead even mentioned? ***** KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — It was once President Barack Obama's "war of necessity." Now, it's America's forgotten war. The Afghan conflict generates barely a whisper on the U.S. presidential campaign trail. It's not a hot topic at the office water cooler or in the halls of Congress — even though more than 80,000 American troops are still fighting here and dying at a rate of one a day. 12 years later and at what result? Public opinion remains largely negative toward the war, with 66 percent opposed to it and just 27 percent in favor in a May AP-GfK poll. More recently, a Quinnipiac University poll found that 60 percent of registered voters felt the U.S. should no longer be involved in Afghanistan. Just 31 percent said the U.S. is doing the right thing by fighting there now. [. . .] More than 1,950 Americans have died in Afghanistan and thousands more have been wounded [. . .] Candidate Obama promised to refocus America's resources on Afghanistan. But by the time President Obama sent 33,000 more troops to Afghanistan in December 2009, [it was already a failed policy] and sapped resolve to build a viable Afghan state. [Obama and], his administration [failed with] Afghanistan's seemingly intractable problems of poverty and corruption. The American people have grown weary [...]. [American troops have been killed by accidents or murdered] in attacks from members of the Afghan security forces — either disgruntled turncoats or Taliban infiltrators. Meanwhile, Obama and his incompetent Administration will continue their failed policies through at least 2014.</Msg><Username>barakthemagicnegroe</Username><Timestamp>1345601029000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:03:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345601240000-171</Id><Title>While the Media laughed over *Legitimate Rape*</Title><Msg>A Democrat Congressman was caught having sex with a 17 year old girl!

(MSFT)’s Windows 8 software this year, marking the first time it has released a Windows device since May 2011, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Microsoft and Nokia are holding a press conference on Sept. 5 in New York to discuss Nokia’s Lumia brand of Windows phones. While Verizon isn’t expected to be part of that event, the carrier intends to roll out a Nokia phone later, said the person, who asked not to be named because the plans are private. That would give Nokia a new beachhead at the top U.S. carrier, building on its longstanding relationship with No. 2 AT&amp;T (T) Inc. Verizon is looking to lessen its dependence on Apple Inc.’s iPhone and devices running Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Android software, which dominate the smartphone market. For Microsoft and Nokia, meanwhile, the move would bolster efforts to regain market share. The Nokia phone would also provide fresh ammunition against the latest iPhone, which people familiar with the matter expect to be introduced on Sept. 12. Brenda Raney, a spokeswoman for Basking Ridge, New Jersey- based Verizon Wireless (VZ), declined to comment, as did Erica Fields at Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. Christopher Hollis, a U.S. spokesman for Espoo, Finland-based Nokia, also declined to comment. Verizon released its only current Windows Phone, the Trophy from HTC Corp., more than a year ago, and it hasn’t been a top seller. Microsoft and Verizon also stumbled with the 2010 release of the Kin phone, which was scrapped after less than two months in Verizon stores. While that experience strained relations, the companies have made strides in improving the partnership since then, the person said. AT&amp;T Relationship For now, Nokia is more closely tied with AT&amp;T, which introduced the Lumia 900 Windows Phone on April 8. AT&amp;T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson has promoted the device and uses it personally. Nokia’s first Windows Phone in the U.S. was the Lumia 710, which debuted at T-Mobile USA in January. Both the AT&amp;T and T- Mobile Lumia devices rely on Microsoft’s older-generation Windows Phone 7 software. Microsoft is releasing the Windows Phone 8 operating system as a companion piece to its new software for personal computers and tablets. The phone software will be able to run on devices with speedier, dual-core chips and high-definition screens, Microsoft has said. In July, a Nokia vice president told the tech news website Neowin that Nokia’s Lumia Windows phones would soon be available on Verizon. Microsoft had a 3.5 percent share of the mobile operating system market in the second quarter, with shipments of 5.4 million, according to research firm IDC. That’s dwarfed by Android’s more than 68 percent and Apple’s 16.9 percent.</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1345607761000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 23:56:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345607783000-193</Id><Title>Minnesota Democrat Allegedly Solicits Sex With 17-Year-Old Boy!!!!!</Title><Msg>You see, among his other pastimes, Mr. Gauthier likes to troll the popular website Craigslist, and not for used toasters, or futons, or any of the things most people use Craigslist for. No, Mr. Gauthier likes to troll Craigslist for sex. With young men. Or in this case, a 17-year-old boy. And Mr. Gauthier apparently gets what he looks for, because he is now alleged to have engaged in oral sex with the unnamed 17-year-old in question, leading many to call his resignation, and even more to call on him to back out of his race for reelection!
