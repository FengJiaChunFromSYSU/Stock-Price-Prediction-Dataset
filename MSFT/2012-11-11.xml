Murray dismissed 54 employees at The American Coal Co., based in Galatia, Illinois, 102 workers at Utah American Energy Inc., in East Carbon, Utah and seven workers at Kanawha Transportation Center Inc., in Wheeling, West Virginia. U.S. coal producers have shut mines and fired thousands of workers this year after cutting tens of millions of tons of output in the face of weaker demand and prices. Coal use has declined as some power stations switched to burning natural gas. The industry is also facing regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency that restrict the burning of coal to produce power and limit new mining permits. “The decision to lay people off was difficult and complicated. First, the Obama Administration’s War on Coal has already destroyed coal markets and resulted in the need for some layoffs,” Gary Broadbent, a spokesman for St. Clairsville, Ohio-base Murray Energy, wrote in an e-mail today. “Second, the layoffs were more severe due to the anticipation of further damage to coal markets caused by the Obama Administration’s disastrous War on Coal.” Chief Executive Officer Robert Murray read a prayer to workers asking God’s forgiveness for “decisions that we are now forced to make to preserve the very existence of any of the enterprises that you have helped us build,” the Washington Post reported. Murray is the country’s largest privately owned coal company, according to its website "War on Coal" haw haw haw hawrrrr Coal is cheap. Murray was a big donor to romney and threw his money away. haw haw haw Hey Obama WON. The routine of daily bashing in hopes he won't be elected serves no purpose.

Ending the Bush tax cuts for those earning over $250,000 enjoyed majority support on Election Day, just as it has since before Obama vanquished John McCain four years ago.

According to the Romanian security company, Windows 8 was infected by 61 malware threats out of 385 of the most popular malware samples in its most recent test, even with Microsoft's own built-in anti-malware software, Widnows Defender running. Bitdefender's senior e-threat analyst, Bogdan Botezatu said that this is because Windows Defender isn't very good at detecting the major malware threats at the moment. "In a cyber-world where missing a single infection can have catastrophic results for the user, the 61 incidents we logged with Windows Defender installed is a serious concern," Botezatu told The INQUIRER. "It may be true that, compared to the lack of antivirus software, the overall security has improved considerably, but if 61 pieces of malware that have been known for the last [six] months pierce right through Windows Defender, we wonder what the success rate would be for freshly-discovered threats or polymorphic malware." Botezatu told us that the sample set found was largely built of Trojans, including password stealers, adware planters, backdoor applications and generic bots, as well as worms, file infectors and two rootkit based pieces of malware. "By far, the best performing categories were Trojans, as most of them are obfuscated enough to prevent initial detection, and some of them do not require UAC elevation, which allows them to sneak into the system without getting blocked or spotted," he said. When carrying it out its examinations, Bitdefender performed an automated test set up on three physical machines each running Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8 with Windows Defender disabled. The machines were booted from a network boot server, copied each sample of malware from the network FTP server and tried to execute it locally. ========================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1352687396767</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 21:29:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352687667787-56</Id><Topic><Title>Since The Hawcreek Team Lost ...</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1352655159221</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-11 12:32:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think so, hawcraper.
