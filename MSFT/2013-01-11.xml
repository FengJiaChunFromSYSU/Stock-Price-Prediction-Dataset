Intel is in a similar situation. Heavily tied to PC but they are moving toward higher growth areas on the component side. Buy these two gorillas while they are cheap.

Quoting: On Jan. 10, Nokia (NYSE: NOK) issued a preliminary report on its Q4 2012 results, claiming that its phone division, Devices and Services, “has exceeded expectations." But in fact, Nokia’s smart device sales continue to collapse on a year-over-year percentage basis. Smart device unit sales (including Lumia phones) declined by a whopping 66.3% compared to Q4 2011 while revenue dropped by 56.3% year over year. The news that Nokia had exceeded expectations was sufficient to spark a rally in Nokia shares, but given the grim Q4 outlook Nokia stated in its Q3 Earnings Report, this should come as cold comfort to investors. Continuing Collapse Nokia reports sales figures for the Smart Device classification in its Devices and Services division, which include all Lumia Windows Phones. The continuing collapse of Smart Device sales can be seen in the table below, drawn from Nokia’s quarterly earnings reports. .... Obfuscation and Spin The earnings reports of troubled companies often become increasingly obfuscatory as their managements seek to minimize the bad news in the eyes of shareholders. They tend to resort to non-standard accounting to characterize earnings and profitability, or engage in other tactics designed to confuse investors. Nokia’s preliminary earnings release does both.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1357929084612</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 13:31:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357929098400-53</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like with windows 8 sales now way over 60 million and growing, People really like windows 8</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357924727881</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 12:18:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The numbers say people love windows 8, good luck to you shorts</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1357929098400</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 13:31:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357929208062-54</Id><Title>Hey Motley Fool</Title><Msg>Nok has a contract with China's largest carrier.

The shortfall last month shrank almost completely to $260 million from $86 billion in December 2011, according to Treasury Department data issued today in Washington. The gap was smaller than the $1 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

New leader to MSFT need not be a good one for MSFT. Steve Jobs was leading AAPL and we got a new leader Tim Cook for APPL but, he screwed it up big time. No new products in the pipe line for AAPL. So what good did Tim do to AAPL? I would rather ignore all this noise for a new leader to MSFT. I think there are lot of good things to look in the current MSFT products and leadership as well. Just look at the balance sheet and financials, they are simply great. What did Google do for the last 5+ years? no new invention. Same with AAPL, other than new versions of IPAD and IPhone I don't see any new innovation in AAPL.</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1357935833813</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:23:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357936114319-79</Id><Topic><Title>this is one of those rare times where you have a chance to a ton of money going long msft calls</Title><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1357867002125</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-10 20:16:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now Timmy, do you see how the stock market works?</Msg><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1357936114319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 15:28:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357936234885-80</Id><Topic><Title>Media, BigFunds, Google and Apple are all trying to put down MSFT, IMO.

The 60-member panel approved and released a draft report today that says many coastal areas face “potentially irreversible impacts” as warmer temperatures lead to flooding, storm surges and water shortages. “The chances of record-breaking, high-temperature extremes will continue to increase as the climate continues to change,” the panel said in its report. Temperatures are predicted to increase, on average, by 2 degrees to 4 degrees in the next few decades, according to the report. The panel of scientists from academia, industry, environmental groups and the government prepared the report, and its findings are the closest to a consensus about global warming in the U.S. Reports in 2000 and 2009 by the U.S. Global Change Research Program concluded carbon-dioxide emissions since the Industrial Revolution have led to a warming of the Earth’s temperature, which threatens to cause extreme weather, drought and floods. Scientific ‘Consensus’ The latest report “represents a consensus of the scientific community of what has changed and what the impacts are across the country,” Katharine Jacobs, a White House official who is director of the assessment, said today after the panel met. “It’s important given how rapidly things are changing.” The current 400-page report for the first time tackles efforts to adapt to global warming and efforts to mitigate its effect, Jacobs said.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1357943112456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 17:25:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357944154033-95</Id><Topic><Title>when do they announce earnings?</Title><Username>cberber69</Username><Timestamp>1357933101094</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 14:38:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Last quarter an earnings shortfall triggered a big price decline.

He is a doer, but no vision. He should have bought Yahoo and he didn't. yes, it would have been 35 a share and it may have looked bad, but Yahoo's intrinsic value is close to $35 to $40 and he would have bought "time" to effectively compete against google and apple... instead, he jerked Yahoo around. He bought Skype after that... and Skype could be so powerful if he also owned Yahoo... he could integrate two ... but no, he wouldn't do it.. because he just don't have the vision. However, Microsoft is in a good position despite his missed opportunities, to his credit, he teamed with Nokia and he also allowed every hardware developer to develop Windows 8. People keep on looking at PC ... but Microsoft has effectively convinced the hardware makers to develop Windows 8. That will be huge ... very soon.

As evident in the middle east military fiascoes the weapon most likely utilized against a modern organized invading force is not assault rifles but improvised explosives. If we truly want the public to carry the armaments that could protect from a hostile military force then every home should have a 50 pound bag of ammonium nitrate fuel oil mix ready to be used in case of invasion. How about it, lets legalize ANFO and detonators which can be purchases without a background check for the good of our country.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1357948720675</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-11 18:58:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357949056455-103</Id><Title>since it is the weekend lets put this simple math problem back up</Title><Msg>given a list of measurements for a single quantity which strategy provides the most likely best estimate of the true value. 1 Averaging the measurements 2 Using the rules of significant digits Anybody chime in with which strategy is most likely to give a closer answer to the true measurement.
