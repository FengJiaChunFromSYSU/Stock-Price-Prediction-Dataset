Quoting: "Despite Microsoft MSFT -0.06% shipping more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses, Redmond’s newest operating system is not making much headway in the enterprise world, with IT decision makers deciding to give it the cold shoulder. "So, what’s holding Windows 8 back? "Forrester Research analyst David Johnson believes that the problem lies with the fact that Microsoft’s newest operating system doesn’t bring anything of real value to the table. " “Enterprises just don’t see Windows 8 having value,” wrote Johnson in a recent report. “They don’t see the value in the changes in Windows 8.” "Johnson goes on to list a number of reasons why businesses are shunning Windows 8, which range from finger-pointing at the new touch-centric ‘Modern’ user interface and the huge training and support burdens that it might bring with it, to the issue of “upgrade fatigue” as a result of the work done to eliminate Windows XP from corporate networks in favor on Windows 7. "Another factor cited by Johnson is Microsoft’s announcement that Windows 8.1, codenamed ‘Blue,” will be released later this year as the first of a raft of annual updates to Windows. " “Blue gives Windows 8 a better chance of adoption,” claimed Johnson. “But the success of that strategy depends on whether enterprises accept the new value in each update, and has much to do with the amount of differences from release to release. That’s the central question.” "</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1371633600870</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 05:20:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371634612164-4</Id><Title>Why Enterprise Is Avoiding Windows 8, part 2</Title><Msg>Additional points. Quoting: "According to a number of IT decision makers I’ve spoken to, one of the key barriers to adoption of Windows 8 is the fact that they see Windows 8 as an “all or nothing upgrade” in that unlike previous versions of Windows, it’s not easy to see how to effectively mix Windows 8 with older versions of Windows in a work setting." ... "In order to make proper use of the Modern user interface, a PC needs to be kitted out with some for of touch input device, whether that be in the form of a screen, pen tablet, or trackpad, and the problem with this is that it add dollars to the bottom line of PC systems while bringing with it little in the way of benefits. " ... "Another problem is uncertainty. While Johnson mentioned Windows 8.1 ‘Blue,’ what he didn’t mention is the ever-growing doubt as to what direction Microsoft is going to take Windows 8 in with this update. Will Microsoft bring back the Start button and Start menu?..." "On top of that, the notion of yearly releases is making admins lose sleep, as this is an unprecedentedly fast upgrade cycle for the Windows platform. This causes means uncertainly not just now, but for years to come."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1371634612164</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 05:36:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371637988953-5</Id><Title>Microsoft Windows Phone &amp; Nokia</Title><Msg>Yesterday there was a rumor that Huawei may buy out Nokia. Recently NSN division of Nokia which is a partnership between Nokia and Siemens was in play. Siemens wanted out of their 49 percent and investment brokers were going to flip it. Huawei is in the same business as Nokia in regards to NSN &amp; also handsets. They do not compete because Huawei gets all the out of US contracts by under bidding. They are in the same business only Huawei is killing NSN in regards to that business. So it makes sense to try and flip the business to Huawei because they wanted to buy the asset when Nokia was on the brink of bankruptcy. Yesterday Huawei made a statement that they wanted to expand to the feature phone business in the US. This was the same day the Nokia buyout rumor was out. If anything, Huawei will buy only the 49 percent of NSN or Nokia will sell their stake to Huawei as well. The handset business will likely remain with Nokia. Huawei would be wasting their money to try and expand in the US. I am in the Washington DC area. It is estimated that up to 90% of the people here work in one way or another with Gov. I do not know if that is correct or not. Homeland Security issued a statement that they suspected Huawei as having ties to China Gov, or Army and they could be involved in spying on the US. They urged people not to use Chinese computer equipment in their infrastructure. So if they buy Nokia, Microsoft is bringing out Surface or buying Black Berry. Once again Huawei is on the banned Homeland Security list. THEY CANNOT INSTALL OR USE THAT EQUIP. IN GOV. It will not disturb the relationship between Microsoft &amp; Nokia if Huawei only buys one division from Nokia called NSN. I personally believe that Huawei will wait out the NSN division if they cannot get it on the cheap. They are already getting the contracts. NSN does not even bid on the end to end build out anymore because Huawei under bids. The sell of in this stock yesterday was not justified or warranted.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1371637988953</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 06:33:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371638638563-6</Id><Topic><Title>Why Enterprise Is Avoiding Windows 8</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1371633600870</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 05:20:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Linux is a great alternative to Windows 8, without all the Microsoft licensing fees.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1371638638563</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 06:43:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371638778708-7</Id><Topic><Title>Why Enterprise Is Avoiding Windows 8, part 2</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1371634612164</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 05:36:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most businesses would like to keep using XP for another 10 years.

PC sales could drop by as much as 10% this year and a lackluster response to its Windows 8 operating system has prodded the company to begin work on a new version of the product (to be released later this year). Where the company has shown consistent strength is in its entertainment division. Its latest release, Xbox 360, managed to overcome major technical issues and offer big processing power with superior online functionality. The unit sold over 75 million units and brought more than 40 million customers to its Xbox Live online gaming service, making it one of the most acclaimed gaming consoles ever. But Microsoft's top positioning in these sectors is starting to look vulnerable, as the recently announced XBox One has been met with general disappointment in two areas: Xbox One users must maintain broadband internet connectivity and login at least once every 24 hours in order to play the games they have bought, and game publishers can block users from lending games or giving them away. In addition, rentals will not be supported when the new unit is launched. There are also privacy concerns, since large amounts of private data (videos, photos, and even things like recorded facial expressions and heart rate) are uploaded and saved on outside servers</Msg><Username>williamzdumb</Username><Timestamp>1371659452227</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 12:30:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371659494813-63</Id><Topic><Title>WELL BOARD.

An insurance company in Guatemala is suing Microsoft for allegedly raiding its offices with armed police officers to search for pirated software. Paul Brinkmann of the South Florida Business Journal, first reported on the lawsuit on Monday. Here's what the company, Seguros Universales SA of Guatemala City, claims happened during the April 2012 raid: "Microsoft appeared with armed Guatemalan law enforcement officers and halted plaintiffs’ business operations. Microsoft then proceeded to extort Plaintiffs by demanding an on-the-spot agreement to pay $70,000 or Microsoft would remove all… servers containing ALL data and operational software." Seguros Universales also alleges that Microsoft tried to strong-arm other Guatemalan insurance firms into paying on-the-spot fines for using pirated software, Brinkmann reported. But Microsoft has a different version of how things went down. "Seguras Universales confessed to a Guatemalan judge and prosecutor that it used illegal software and freely entered into an agreement to compensate Microsoft for its wrongdoing," a Microsoft spokesperson told us in an email. "This suit is a meritless attempt to distract from its own software piracy, and we look forward to addressing the claims," the spokesperson said. Microsoft is a member of the Business Software Alliance, an industry group that tracks usage of illegal software. In a 2011 survey, the BSA found that 79% of software in use in Guatemala is pirated, compared to 61% for Latin America as a whole, and 42% globally</Msg><Username>williamzdumb</Username><Timestamp>1371659705623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 12:35:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371659743765-68</Id><Topic><Title>WINDOZE HAS ONLY..

Another complaint is pretty mind-boggling to me. Because Windows 8 can associate a protocol to either an app in the Metro interface or on the desktop, you could find yourself looking at the opposite interface depending on how things are configured. As Allen's example lays out, clicking on a URL while using Outlook on the desktop can open it up in Internet Explorer inside of the Metro interface - and I assume the vice versa can also be true. This is a major beef with me because I'm drawn to OSes that improve efficiency and workflow - not those that destroy it</Msg><Username>eight_suckz</Username><Timestamp>1371659777119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 12:36:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371659818343-70</Id><Topic><Title>At a tiny 0.53%, Windoze 8 adoption levels in the enterprise are shockingly low</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1370388335249</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-04 19:25:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>M$ FAIL reiteration</Msg><Username>the.heretic7</Username><Timestamp>1371659818343</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 12:36:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371659848567-71</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 enterprise take-up terrible</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1371604958018</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 21:22:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's always good to go Linux.</Msg><Username>the.heretic7</Username><Timestamp>1371659848567</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 12:37:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371660857188-72</Id><Topic><Title>Huawei to buy the corpse of Nokia, and kill windoze phone</Title><Username>the.heretic7</Username><Timestamp>1371609052038</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 22:30:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bumpity</Msg><Username>the.heretic7</Username><Timestamp>1371660857188</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 12:54:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371660899368-73</Id><Title>Huawei critical of "weak" windoze phone</Title><Msg>And will remove it from Nokia once they buy them.</Msg><Username>the.heretic7</Username><Timestamp>1371660899368</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 12:54:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371661247827-74</Id><Topic><Title>Huawei to buy the corpse of Nokia, and kill windoze phone</Title><Username>the.heretic7</Username><Timestamp>1371609052038</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 22:30:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ooooooohhh...

An insurance company in Guatemala is suing Microsoft for allegedly raiding its offices with armed police officers to search for pirated software. Paul Brinkmann of the South Florida Business Journal, first reported on the lawsuit on Monday. Here's what the company, Seguros Universales SA of Guatemala City, claims happened during the April 2012 raid: "Microsoft appeared with armed Guatemalan law enforcement officers and halted plaintiffs’ business operations. Microsoft then proceeded to extort Plaintiffs by demanding an on-the-spot agreement to pay $70,000 or Microsoft would remove all… servers containing ALL data and operational software." Seguros Universales also alleges that Microsoft tried to strong-arm other Guatemalan insurance firms into paying on-the-spot fines for using pirated software, Brinkmann reported. But Microsoft has a different version of how things went down. "Seguras Universales confessed to a Guatemalan judge and prosecutor that it used illegal software and freely entered into an agreement to compensate Microsoft for its wrongdoing," a Microsoft spokesperson told us in an email. "This suit is a meritless attempt to distract from its own software piracy, and we look forward to addressing the claims," the spokesperson said. Microsoft is a member of the Business Software Alliance, an industry group that tracks usage of illegal software. In a 2011 survey, the BSA found that 79% of software in use in Guatemala is pirated, compared to 61% for Latin America as a whole, and 42% globally</Msg><Username>msft_a_dog</Username><Timestamp>1371664318588</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:51:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371664356899-90</Id><Topic><Title>DID YOU KNOW SAFARI IS THE FASTEST SEARCH ENGINE....WOW,,,,APPLE BEATS EM ALL !</Title><Username>eight_suckz</Username><Timestamp>1371599022704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 19:43:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is a Mac safe from PC viruses?

PC sales could drop by as much as 10% this year and a lackluster response to its Windows 8 operating system has prodded the company to begin work on a new version of the product (to be released later this year). Where the company has shown consistent strength is in its entertainment division. Its latest release, Xbox 360, managed to overcome major technical issues and offer big processing power with superior online functionality. The unit sold over 75 million units and brought more than 40 million customers to its Xbox Live online gaming service, making it one of the most acclaimed gaming consoles ever. But Microsoft's top positioning in these sectors is starting to look vulnerable, as the recently announced XBox One has been met with general disappointment in two areas: Xbox One users must maintain broadband internet connectivity and login at least once every 24 hours in order to play the games they have bought, and game publishers can block users from lending games or giving them away. In addition, rentals will not be supported when the new unit is launched. There are also privacy concerns, since large amounts of private data (videos, photos, and even things like recorded facial expressions and heart rate) are uploaded and saved on outside servers</Msg><Username>msft_a_dog</Username><Timestamp>1371664507219</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:55:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371664533547-98</Id><Topic><Title>Skype Brings Free Video Messaging Out Of Preview, Redefines ‘Visual Voicemail’....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1371488785392</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-06-17 13:06:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More stuff for re-read.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1371664533547</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:55:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371664644066-99</Id><Topic><Title>Personalized Learning Initiative with Microsoft, Dell and Intel....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368807555798</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 12:19:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Again another must re-read.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1371664644066</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:57:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371664776598-100</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo's scattergun approach to Windows 8 bears fruit in down market (Source ZD/Net)</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1369516633734</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 17:17:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One more time for a re-read.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1371664776598</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 13:59:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371664798895-101</Id><Topic><Title>THINGS I'M LEARNING ABOUT APPLE.

Further, he also mentions that it's impossible to keep the Metro interface on one display permanently, which would be ideal for those who like a dashboard. Another complaint is pretty mind-boggling to me. Because Windows 8 can associate a protocol to either an app in the Metro interface or on the desktop, you could find yourself looking at the opposite interface depending on how things are configured. As Allen's example lays out, clicking on a URL while using Outlook on the desktop can open it up in Internet Explorer inside of the Metro interface - and I assume the vice versa can also be true.

An insurance company in Guatemala is suing Microsoft for allegedly raiding its offices with armed police officers to search for pirated software. Paul Brinkmann of the South Florida Business Journal, first reported on the lawsuit on Monday. Here's what the company, Seguros Universales SA of Guatemala City, claims happened during the April 2012 raid: "Microsoft appeared with armed Guatemalan law enforcement officers and halted plaintiffs’ business operations. Microsoft then proceeded to extort Plaintiffs by demanding an on-the-spot agreement to pay $70,000 or Microsoft would remove all… servers containing ALL data and operational software." Seguros Universales also alleges that Microsoft tried to strong-arm other Guatemalan insurance firms into paying on-the-spot fines for using pirated software, Brinkmann reported. But Microsoft has a different version of how things went down. "Seguras Universales confessed to a Guatemalan judge and prosecutor that it used illegal software and freely entered into an agreement to compensate Microsoft for its wrongdoing," a Microsoft spokesperson told us in an email. "This suit is a meritless attempt to distract from its own software piracy, and we look forward to addressing the claims," the spokesperson said. Microsoft is a member of the Business Software Alliance, an industry group that tracks usage of illegal software. In a 2011 survey, the BSA found that 79% of software in use in Guatemala is pirated, compared to 61% for Latin America as a whole, and 42% globally</Msg><Username>roiup</Username><Timestamp>1371667372119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:42:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371667405036-119</Id><Topic><Title>DID YOU KNOW SAFARI IS THE FASTEST SEARCH ENGINE....WOW,,,,APPLE BEATS EM ALL !</Title><Username>eight_suckz</Username><Timestamp>1371599022704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 19:43:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is a Mac safe from PC viruses?

PC sales could drop by as much as 10% this year and a lackluster response to its Windows 8 operating system has prodded the company to begin work on a new version of the product (to be released later this year). Where the company has shown consistent strength is in its entertainment division. Its latest release, Xbox 360, managed to overcome major technical issues and offer big processing power with superior online functionality. The unit sold over 75 million units and brought more than 40 million customers to its Xbox Live online gaming service, making it one of the most acclaimed gaming consoles ever. But Microsoft's top positioning in these sectors is starting to look vulnerable, as the recently announced XBox One has been met with general disappointment in two areas: Xbox One users must maintain broadband internet connectivity and login at least once every 24 hours in order to play the games they have bought, and game publishers can block users from lending games or giving them away. In addition, rentals will not be supported when the new unit is launched. There are also privacy concerns, since large amounts of private data (videos, photos, and even things like recorded facial expressions and heart rate) are uploaded and saved on outside servers</Msg><Username>eight_suckz</Username><Timestamp>1371667539623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:45:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371667926119-124</Id><Topic><Title>DID YOU KNOW SAFARI IS THE FASTEST SEARCH ENGINE....WOW,,,,APPLE BEATS EM ALL !</Title><Username>eight_suckz</Username><Timestamp>1371599022704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 19:43:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>seems to me that Safari is a browser not a search engine- cant you find anyone to play with - get with your mother about a diaper change too</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1371667926119</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:52:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371668294050-125</Id><Title>WINDOWS HAS MORE THAN 90% OF THE ENTERPRISE MARKET</Title><Msg>Almost nobody in the enterprise uses apple junk- don't believe it look around you at work or if you are still in diapers check with your mother or grownup relative</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1371668294050</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 14:58:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371668367829-126</Id><Topic><Title>WELL BOARD.

Further, he also mentions that it's impossible to keep the Metro interface on one display permanently, which would be ideal for those who like a dashboard. Another complaint is pretty mind-boggling to me. Because Windows 8 can associate a protocol to either an app in the Metro interface or on the desktop, you could find yourself looking at the opposite interface depending on how things are configured. As Allen's example lays out, clicking on a URL while using Outlook on the desktop can open it up in Internet Explorer inside of the Metro interface - and I assume the vice versa can also be true. This is a major beef with me because I'm drawn to OSes that improve efficiency and workflow - not those that destroy it..A DIRECT PASTE IN OF ALLEN'S INTERVIEW.

Further, he also mentions that it's impossible to keep the Metro interface on one display permanently, which would be ideal for those who like a dashboard. Another complaint is pretty mind-boggling to me. Because Windows 8 can associate a protocol to either an app in the Metro interface or on the desktop, you could find yourself looking at the opposite interface depending on how things are configured. As Allen's example lays out, clicking on a URL while using Outlook on the desktop can open it up in Internet Explorer inside of the Metro interface - and I assume the vice versa can also be true. This is a major beef with me because I'm drawn to OSes that improve efficiency and workflow - not those that destroy it..A DIRECT PASTE IN OF ALLEN'S INTERVIEW.

PC sales could drop by as much as 10% this year and a lackluster response to its Windows 8 operating system has prodded the company to begin work on a new version of the product (to be released later this year). Where the company has shown consistent strength is in its entertainment division. Its latest release, Xbox 360, managed to overcome major technical issues and offer big processing power with superior online functionality. The unit sold over 75 million units and brought more than 40 million customers to its Xbox Live online gaming service, making it one of the most acclaimed gaming consoles ever. But Microsoft's top positioning in these sectors is starting to look vulnerable, as the recently announced XBox One has been met with general disappointment in two areas: Xbox One users must maintain broadband internet connectivity and login at least once every 24 hours in order to play the games they have bought, and game publishers can block users from lending games or giving them away. In addition, rentals will not be supported when the new unit is launched. There are also privacy concerns, since large amounts of private data (videos, photos, and even things like recorded facial expressions and heart rate) are uploaded and saved on outside servers</Msg><Username>helenwaite12</Username><Timestamp>1371673061096</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 16:17:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371673092704-177</Id><Topic><Title>WELL BOARD.

An insurance company in Guatemala is suing Microsoft for allegedly raiding its offices with armed police officers to search for pirated software. Paul Brinkmann of the South Florida Business Journal, first reported on the lawsuit on Monday. Here's what the company, Seguros Universales SA of Guatemala City, claims happened during the April 2012 raid: "Microsoft appeared with armed Guatemalan law enforcement officers and halted plaintiffs’ business operations. Microsoft then proceeded to extort Plaintiffs by demanding an on-the-spot agreement to pay $70,000 or Microsoft would remove all… servers containing ALL data and operational software." Seguros Universales also alleges that Microsoft tried to strong-arm other Guatemalan insurance firms into paying on-the-spot fines for using pirated software, Brinkmann reported. But Microsoft has a different version of how things went down. "Seguras Universales confessed to a Guatemalan judge and prosecutor that it used illegal software and freely entered into an agreement to compensate Microsoft for its wrongdoing," a Microsoft spokesperson told us in an email. "This suit is a meritless attempt to distract from its own software piracy, and we look forward to addressing the claims," the spokesperson said. Microsoft is a member of the Business Software Alliance, an industry group that tracks usage of illegal software. In a 2011 survey, the BSA found that 79% of software in use in Guatemala is pirated, compared to 61% for Latin America as a whole, and 42% globally</Msg><Username>helenwaite12</Username><Timestamp>1371673236434</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 16:20:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371673269834-182</Id><Topic><Title>WINDOZE HAS ONLY..

Published two months ago. Quoting: "At this point, unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market", Bob O'Donnell, IDC vice president, says. Holy Moley, Windows 8 slowed the market? You want to know why Ballmer booted Sinfosky out the door? O'Donnell offers chilling indictment. "While some consumers appreciate the new form factors and touch capabilities of Windows 8, the radical changes to the UI, removal of the familiar Start button, and the costs associated with touch have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices", he says. "Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market".</Msg><Username>gggoode33</Username><Timestamp>1371679738334</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 18:08:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371679788594-226</Id><Title>BALLMER days have to be numbered by now.</Title><Msg>All of these changes cost money to do.

ADD WHICH IS BIG PRE-ROLL O</Title><Msg>We still don’t know the exact date that the Xbox One will launch, but we do know it’s going to happen in November. Sony on the other hand has only said that the PS4 will arrive in time for the Holidays this year, which means a release could happen any time from September right up until December. It looks likely Sony will go head-to-head with Microsoft in November, though, if a UK newspaper advertisement is to be believed. The Sun newspaper has a PS4 advert that highlights the price of the new console as well as reminding everyone you can trade your used games easily and don’t need the Internet to use it. But it also lists a launch date of November 21. The advert certainly doesn’t look fake, but it seems unlikely Sony wouldn’t make a big deal about announcing the launch date. So chances are the newspaper has messed up and printed the advertisement too early. Sony has a lot of flexibility in the date that it picks, so this could actually be a planned accident. What they would really like to happen is for Microsoft to confirm the Xbox One release day first, then Sony can do the maximum damage by choosing to launch around then, probably just before, in an attempt to steal sales and drown out Microsoft’s marketing.</Msg><Username>trollers_nightmare</Username><Timestamp>1371685834507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 19:50:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371686052866-242</Id><Title>LONGS-R-SUKKIN'HINDTEET.

PC sales could drop by as much as 10% this year and a lackluster response to its Windows 8 operating system has prodded the company to begin work on a new version of the product (to be released later this year). Where the company has shown consistent strength is in its entertainment division. Its latest release, Xbox 360, managed to overcome major technical issues and offer big processing power with superior online functionality. The unit sold over 75 million units and brought more than 40 million customers to its Xbox Live online gaming service, making it one of the most acclaimed gaming consoles ever. But Microsoft's top positioning in these sectors is starting to look vulnerable, as the recently announced XBox One has been met with general disappointment in two areas: Xbox One users must maintain broadband internet connectivity and login at least once every 24 hours in order to play the games they have bought, and game publishers can block users from lending games or giving them away. In addition, rentals will not be supported when the new unit is launched. There are also privacy concerns, since large amounts of private data (videos, photos, and even things like recorded facial expressions and heart rate) are uploaded and saved on outside servers</Msg><Username>ohno_u_dont</Username><Timestamp>1371693324973</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 21:55:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371693389962-278</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT CO-FOUDER PAUL ALLEN HATES 8 TOO.

Further, he also mentions that it's impossible to keep the Metro interface on one display permanently, which would be ideal for those who like a dashboard. Another complaint is pretty mind-boggling to me. Because Windows 8 can associate a protocol to either an app in the Metro interface or on the desktop, you could find yourself looking at the opposite interface depending on how things are configured. As Allen's example lays out, clicking on a URL while using Outlook on the desktop can open it up in Internet Explorer inside of the Metro interface - and I assume the vice versa can also be true. This is a major beef with me because I'm drawn to OSes that improve efficiency and workflow - not those that destroy it..A DIRECT PASTE IN OF ALLEN'S INTERVIEW.

The flash HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.3 in June from May's final reading of 49.2, drifting further away from the 50-point level demarcating expansion from contraction. It was the weakest level since September. "Manufacturing sectors are weighed down by deteriorating external demand, moderating domestic demand and rising destocking pressures," said Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC. "Beijing prefers to use reforms rather than stimulus to sustain growth. While reforms can boost long-term growth prospects, they will have a limited impact in the short-term. As such we expect slightly weaker growth in 2Q." China's economy grew at its slowest pace for 13 years in 2012 and so far this year economic data has underwhelmed, bringing warnings from some analysts that the country could miss its growth target of 7.5 percent for this year.

Sony on the other hand has only said that the PS4 will arrive in time for the Holidays this year, which means a release could happen any time from September right up until December. It looks likely Sony will go head-to-head with Microsoft in November, though, if a UK newspaper advertisement is to be believed. The Sun newspaper has a PS4 advert that highlights the price of the new console as well as reminding everyone you can trade your used games easily and don’t need the Internet to use it. But it also lists a launch date of November 21. The advert certainly doesn’t look fake, but it seems unlikely Sony wouldn’t make a big deal about announcing the launch date. So chances are the newspaper has messed up and printed the advertisement too early. Sony has a lot of flexibility in the date that it picks, so this could actually be a planned accident. What they would really like to happen is for Microsoft to confirm the Xbox One release day first, then Sony can do the maximum damage by choosing to launch around then, probably just before, in an attempt to steal sales and drown out Microsoft’s marketing.</Msg><Username>want_refund</Username><Timestamp>1371700766734</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-19 23:59:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
