I can no longer use all the older w7, XP machines that I run into because I am so used to swiping and flicking on the screen. No matter what old machine I use it is now too slow of an experience because of no touch screen that I constantly attempt to flick the screen on a non touch screen machine when I am on one. No matter how hard I try, it has become instinct to swipe and when I have to use the mouse or touchpad to sroll web pages it is a pain in the #$%$ now compared to W8. The tablet flat down bothers my neck. I guess it depends on age and you have body has been beat to heck. So don't get a Surface or a touch laptop if you want to use old machines again. It will seem like too much work when you have to switch back to W7 laptop.

That is what makes Obama's recession that he created along with his leftist buddies in congress so bad....declining wages, high unemployment, yet high gas prices because of Oabma's oppressive fossil fuel policy, that are causing higher consumer prices. I told you that raising taxes on folks that own small businesses just raise the price of goods since it is an operating overhead cost of doing business.
