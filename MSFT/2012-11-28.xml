It's on Forbes. Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund this morning trimmed his EPS estimates for Microsoft, citing an “awkward” debut for Windows 8, the latest version of the company’s flagship operating system software. “Windows 8 is off to an awkward launch,” he writes in a research note. Sherlund notes that PC vendors have been slow to bring out tablets and ultrabooks based on the new OS, and he says there’s a “learning curve” facing users who switch to Win 8. He also notes that the dual interface design – you switch back to Windows 7 mode for some legacy applications – has received bad press.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1354112145383</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 09:15:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354112959321-13</Id><Title>Why down again?</Title><Msg>I don't get it.

At the conference, CEO Steve Ballmer said that Windows 8 is “off to a great start,” (although some reports have noted otherwise) and that the firm is seeing “fantastic” demand for its touchscreen devices, as it has sold 40 million Windows 8 licenses so far. Office 365 is on track to be one of the firm’s fastest growing businesses. Microsoft also says that it selling four times as many Windows phones as it did last year, with Nokia (NOK) and HTC phones sold out in a number of countries; Ballmer says that there are now 120,000 apps available." This is absolutely nothing but pablum for the stockholders. There are no specifics and no mention about WHICH countries "sold out" windows phones, nor what kind of numbers those "sell outs" involve. It's the usual vague "We got nothing but suck on this lollipop for awhile and you'll feel better about the failure of the stock to move for a decade." type of smokescreen hype typical of Ballmer historically.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1354124762642</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 12:46:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354125874291-58</Id><Title>windows blue=netvista; msft and ibm</Title><Msg>a powerhouse combination...as neoware was ibm's upgrade path to netvista, until alas they didn't have a patent...so the new glue would be ?vcsy? and with ibm eclipse . and with eclipse...eclipse/mozilla/zap(8x8). wag</Msg><Username>neoware03</Username><Timestamp>1354125874291</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 13:04:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354126298222-59</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's Windows Phone 8 Plagued by More Problems</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1354118159194</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:55:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You must be with the but whole the street .

More bad news for Microsoft's Windows 8. Asus CFO David Chang tells the Wall Street Journal, "Demand for Windows 8 is not that good right now." He said demand for touch notebooks has been slow. Asus is the fifth-biggest PC maker in the world, according to Gartner. In addition to Chang's quote, Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund writes today, "Windows 8 is off to an awkward launch." Forbes has Sherlund's note, which says there's a "learning curve" for Windows 8, and PC makers have been slow to bring out Windows 8 computers. A quick note on Sherlund. He's one of the most respected Microsoft analysts—and that includes people at Microsoft. When he's saying something negative on the company, it's worth paying attention to.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1354127230773</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 13:27:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354127980379-64</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: America on Hold</Title><Username>plmartin_2012</Username><Timestamp>1354117512599</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:45:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But you will go hungry before the next 4 years stupid #$%$.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1354127980379</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 13:39:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354127985763-65</Id><Topic><Title>How would you rate the Win 8 user experience ?</Title><Username>budicecream</Username><Timestamp>1354117463858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:44:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In addition 10 Sec boot time !!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1354127985763</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 13:39:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354128455358-66</Id><Topic><Title>How would you rate the Win 8 user experience ?</Title><Username>budicecream</Username><Timestamp>1354117463858</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 10:44:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Win 8 reminds me of an earlier interface, BOB.</Msg><Username>naslem122</Username><Timestamp>1354128455358</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 13:47:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354128470558-67</Id><Topic><Title>theregister : M$ 'manipulating' winblow$ 8 sales numbers ?</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1354119308479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 11:15:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The register is a long time anti Microsoft propaganda sh.t rag that apparently cant be stopped from publishing by the British Govt.

I'm using one right now, and not for long, test driving it kind of. It seems they did changes for the sake of making changes - which means very little thought went into how to make it more user friendly. Just way too much clicking just to do simple things and if it weren't for google search to see how to do certain steps, it would be frustrating as heck to get around. They simply don't make it easy for whatever damn reason. Windows 8 interface reminds me of finding escalators in a mall, they always make you walk as long as possible to find the connection to go up or down because the inconvenience means you have to walk by the stores to get to the escalators - same thing with windows 8, functions are there, but you simply to flip through all these MS interfaces just to get there...lol.... they think we are to going buy something along the way on Metro interface?

Income....Tax, More income more tax Equal Representation... One vote, rich or poor It's the tax rate that's important not the amount, that determines "fairness." being rich and paying a lot of tax means you made a lot of money, but not that you "own" more country. You own the same as everyone else. The tax leaves your hands and goes into the treasury. the voters say what it is spent on, it is no longer yours. I would be happy to pay millions in taxes if I made corresponding income. you just can't get it. It is faulty thnking to think someone paying 10 million in income tax is being treated less fairly than someone paying 0 tax because deductions take away all the tax.What you are suggesting is aristocracy, exactly what the tea party revolt was about and why the USA was formed to be against.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1354148053859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 19:14:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354151228599-108</Id><Title>JFK TAX PLAN</Title><Msg>If everyone in America had read Stephen Moore's new book, "Who's The Fairest of Them All?", Barack Obama would have lost the election in a landslide. The point here is not to say, "Where was Stephen Moore when we needed him?" A more apt question might be, "Where was the whole economics profession when we needed them?" Where were the media? For that matter, where were the Republicans? Since "Who's The Fairest of Them All?" was published in October, there was little chance that it would affect this year's election. But this little gem of a book exposes, in plain language and with easily understood facts, the whole house of cards of assumptions, fallacies and falsehoods which constitute the liberal vision of the economy. Yet that vision triumphed on election day, thanks to misinformation that was artfully presented and seldom challenged. The title "Who's The Fairest of Them All?" is an obvious response to liberals' claim that their policies are aimed at creating "fairness" by, among other things, making sure that "the rich" pay their "fair share" of taxes. If you want a brief but thorough education on that, just read chapter 4, which by itself is well worth the price of the book. A couple of graphs on pages 104 and 108 are enough to annihilate the argument about "tax cuts for the rich." These graphs show that, under both Republican President Calvin Coolidge and Democratic President John F. Kennedy, high-income people paid more tax revenues into the federal treasury after tax rates went down than they did before. There is nothing mysterious about this. At high tax rates, vast sums of money disappear into tax shelters at home or is shipped overseas. At lower tax rates, that money comes out of hiding and goes into the American economy, creating jobs, rising output and rising incomes. Under these conditions, higher tax revenues can be collected by the government, even though tax rates are lower. Indeed, high income people not only end up paying more taxes, but a higher share of all taxes, under these conditions. This is not just a theory. It is what hard evidence shows happened under both Democratic and Republican administrations, from the days of Calvin Coolidge to John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. That hard evidence is presented in clear and unmistakable terms in "Who's The Fairest of Us All?" Another surprising fact brought out in this book is that the Democrats and Republicans both took positions during the Kennedy administration that were the direct opposite of the positions they take today. As Stephen Moore points out, "the Republicans almost universally opposed and the Democrats almost universally favored" the cuts in tax rates that President Kennedy proposed. Such Republican Senate stalwarts as Barry Goldwater and Bob Dole voted against reducing the top tax rate from 91% to 70%. Democratic Congressman Wilbur Mills led the charge for lower tax rates. Unlike the Republicans today, John F. Kennedy had an answer when critics tried to portray his tax cut proposal as just a "tax cut for the rich." President Kennedy argued that it was a tax cut for the economy, that changed incentives meant a faster growing economy and that "A rising tide lifts all boats." If Republicans today cannot seem to come up with their own answer when critics cry out "tax cuts for the rich," maybe they can just go back and read John F. Kennedy's answer. A truly optimistic person might even hope that media pundits would go back and check out the facts before arguing as if the only way to reduce the deficit is to raise tax rates on "the rich." If they are afraid that they would be stigmatized as conservatives if they favored cuts in tax rates, they might take heart from the fact that not only John F. Kennedy, but even John Maynard Keynes as well, argued that cutting tax rates could increase tax revenues and thereby help reduce the deficit. Because so few people bother to check the facts, Barack Obama can get away with statements about how "tax cuts for the rich" have "cost" the government money that now needs to be recouped. Such statements not only promote class warfare, to Obama's benefit on election day, they also distract attention from his own runaway spending behind unprecedented trillion dollar deficits</Msg><Username>thelight1949</Username><Timestamp>1354151228599</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 20:07:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354151383416-109</Id><Topic><Title>Tax hike will barely affect deficit, it's about spending folks, adding taxes is just fuel for the fire</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1354066608521</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 20:36:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hedge fund manager receive their income as capital gains not dividends.
