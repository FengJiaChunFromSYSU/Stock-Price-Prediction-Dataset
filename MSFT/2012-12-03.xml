Apple stock is too pricey right now, and MSFT is a value. Apple pays a 1.8% dividend, but remember one important thing..............STEVE JOBS is dead. No one else at Apple can do what he did. Microsoft has a lot of good things going for it right now. MSFT will not fall below the $26 support level. Apple could actually fall below $500.</Msg><Username>b3keyboard</Username><Timestamp>1354510872512</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 00:01:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354517025381-2</Id><Topic><Title>Zune, Vista, Surface, Windows 8: MSFT innovation successes at its best!</Title><Username>dogeater2008</Username><Timestamp>1354512396290</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 00:26:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, Vista has some issues at the beginign, but it neverthless at some point captured some 20% of the worldwide market share for all windows. Surface and Win 8 both just started abotu a month ago. It is reasonbale to expect Surface will sell more than 1 millon unites in its first quater. If this is the case, it will still be a great success, since this harware bsuiness is all a stream of bsuiness for MSFt. 1 millin of Surface means almost $600 million of top line in revenue. A single product in a sinegle quater, totally new business, this may be small comparing to ipad now, but for MSFt, this is outstanding!!!! As for Win 8, it is also doing great considerring it is a totally new interface. total more than 40 million copies sold, and the instialled base for WIn 8 has alreay pased more than 20 million users, that is, yes, more than 20 millions of real computers are in real peoples hands. this is only a month.

MSft increased divideend by 15% this year and some 30% ast year. What other company is doing this , especially when the dividend yield is already 3.5% now? MSFt will slowly build harware, then take more and more control over ithe distribution of its software, and in the mean time, possibly making new revenur in the manyy hundreds of billons over the coming 5-6 years!!!! for example, MSFt will easily sell 5-10 milillion of Surface RT and Surface Pro next year.

They may issue a special dividend (doubt it), and they may hang around a while. They have a lot of cash. But until they actually wake up and, most importantly, catch up, they're in deep trouble. Most of retail that buy MSFT these days (aside from the XBOX, granted), are people that buy in spite of AAPL. Go ahead and ask you friends with a Windows phone, if any of your friends even have one, what they think of iPhones. Or iPads. Or OSX. Or whatever. They hate them. Fair enough. But is that actually enough for MSFT to be viable? I really doubt it.</Msg><Username>tiyfuk</Username><Timestamp>1354526741885</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 04:25:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354541934808-12</Id><Topic><Title>3.5% Dividend, 60+ Billion in Current Assets</Title><Username>b3keyboard</Username><Timestamp>1354295323290</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 12:08:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fact is, msft eps doubled over the last 5-7 years, and not many companies have done this. the last time i checked, MSFT made the most money with Office, and they made the end highest amount of money from Servers and Tools, and Widows Divison is the smaest of the three bigest divisions. The first of the two sell much of softwares to governments and corporations , without any need to sell new PCs. So, a little bit slow dow with PC sales is ok if they can successfuly transition to WIn 8, which i believe it can build up over time. Despite heavy critisism, the intalled base for WIn 8 will be almost close to 40-60 millions by the end of this year, in rreal peoples hands, not just sold to OEMs. Again, MSFT is selling WInodws over the internet and in retail stores, without any need for new PC sales. This is how MSFT pushes Windows through every time. every time, some people donot like it, but eventurally MSft will get there. Stay invested in msft. At an effective p/e of 5, i am gettign the best company in the world for 50% discount.</Msg><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1354541934808</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 08:38:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354542073117-13</Id><Topic><Title>Special Dividend</Title><Username>donald_walker310</Username><Timestamp>1354520365503</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 02:39:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bet MSft is going to wait till the final week of this year to decide this.

I speculate that MSft will take this route to get EPS growth to more than 10% over the next 5 years. Another major new business will be harware sales like Surface Pro and Surface RT. It is reasonable to expect them to sell 5-15 millions unites in the coming 4 qauters. If this happens, these will add $3-6 billions of fresh new revenue in its very first year.

Quoting from Seeking Alpha: Conclusions Compared to Microsoft's budget, Windows 8 is underperforming. The Surface RT is heavily underperforming. The upcoming Surface Pro is going to underperform, and for a few simple reasons: it's going head to head with the iPad, the absolute king of the hill in the tablet market, offering way less (e.g. battery life) and costing much more (at least $70). These products represented the last chances Microsoft had to maintain its position in the declining PC market while building a new position in the tablet market: the company misfired badly. I say, head for the lifeboats, and abandon this sinking ship before it's too late.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1354551927470</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 11:25:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354552236055-46</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA IS CRAZY.

Microsoft (MSFT) Of all the companies we looked at, Microsoft seems to be the most likely to approve a special one-time dividend. The company has a massive cash reserve of around $51 billion, versus just $11.9 billion in debt. The company’s insider ownership isn’t super high, but at 9.1%, insiders do own more of Microsoft than your typical S&amp;P 500 company. Microsoft has a regular dividend yield of 3.4%, and a payout ratio of 30, which is not too high to believe that we could see it announce a special one-time dividend before the end of the year.</Msg><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1354557938102</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 13:05:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354558102755-59</Id><Topic><Title>What year will MSFT collapse?</Title><Username>dogeater2008</Username><Timestamp>1354512233469</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 00:23:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft will collapse in 2014, when they try to kill XP again.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1354558102755</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 13:08:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354558287094-60</Id><Topic><Title>kate is going to have a baby, fiscal cliff a non issue</Title><Username>smallstock1</Username><Timestamp>1354555149408</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 12:19:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mee too.

Rich Paid More Revenue Under Bush Tax Cuts While progressives attack the Bush tax cuts and President Barack Obama wants to let them expire for families making over $250,000, figures released by the IRS show the wealthiest 1% actually paid more in taxes after the Bush tax cuts were passed, and the bottom half of taxpayers actually paid less in income taxes. According to IRS data, the “richest 1% paid $84 billion more in taxes in 2007 than they had in 2000,” a 23% increase. In addition, their “share of the overall income tax burden grew, climbing from 37% in 2000 to 40% in 2007.” All this occurred even though their rates went down. The IRS numbers also found the bottom half of taxpayers “paid $6 billion less in income taxes in 2007 than they had seven years earlier,” which is a 16% decrease, and “their share of the total income tax burden actually went from 3.9% to 2.9%.” Further, as Investors Business Daily noted, the Bush tax cuts also pushed millions of people off of the tax rolls entirely because Bush “doubled the per-child tax credit to $1,000 and lowered the bottom rate to 10%.”</Msg><Username>thelight1949</Username><Timestamp>1354569309518</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 16:15:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354569619670-93</Id><Topic><Title>will it hit 25s ? would like to buy.</Title><Username>raggwead</Username><Timestamp>1354559206591</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-03 13:26:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>for a trade or long term? for a trade, even a loser like this stock might bounce on some support.

These people working for Mr. Fair Share apparently haven't paid any share, let alone their fair share. Previous reports have shown how well-paid Obama's White House staff is, with 457 aides pulling down more than $37 million last year. That's up seven workers and nearly $4 million from the Bush administration's last year. Nearly one-third of Obama's aides make more than $100,000 with 21 being paid the top White House salary of $172,200, each. The IRS' 2010 delinquent tax revelations come as part of a required annual agency report on federal employees' tax compliance. Turns out, an awful lot of folks being paid by taxpayers are not paying their own income taxes. The report finds that thousands of federal employees owe the country more than $3.4 billion in back taxes. That's up 3% in the past year, How about starting with what the Obama groupies owe. And Craper, Geithner was a tax cheat. He only paid the $42,000 in back taxes after he accepted his current job. You Liberals want everyone else to pay but you. Even you craper, who has never made enough money to pay federal taxes because you are a LOSER.

But together Windows 8 and the Surface could be the last straw that compels Microsoft's board to give Balmer his long, long overdue walking papers. Under his maladministration Microsoft has managed to miss every major trend in consumer technology - smartphones, tablets, search, social media, etc. He has been an unmitigated disaster for all Microsoft shareholders - except himself, ensconced as he among the top 20 on the Forbes 400 list. His tenure represents a blot on Gates' legacy as well, who could have forced him out at any time over the past ten years but didn't.

The Democratic leader first warned of a discharge petition on Friday. Under a "discharge petition," a bill can be brought to the floor without going through a committee or without approval of House leadership. The bill would need an absolute majority - 218 votes - to pass. While there are only 192 Democrats in the House, some Republicans have expressed support for the bill.
