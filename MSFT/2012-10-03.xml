On October 26, Microsoft is set to launch Windows 8 in conjunction with its Surface tablet. Microsoft's new software platform is a fusion of conventional personal computer, tablet, and smartphone interfaces. For example, Windows 8 users can enter desktop commands through touch screen technology, before picking up a Microsoft Surface tablet and toggling through tiles that open up Excel calculations.</Msg><Username>tomsaga25</Username><Timestamp>1349249539255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 03:32:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349252793310-2</Id><Title>This is a great site for MSFT, what do you guys think.</Title><Msg>The information provided at VIP is very compelling and it has assisted me in the decision making process and it has also created a better base for me to understand stock MSFT, visit it at, vippennystocksite dotcom</Msg><Username>marshall5842</Username><Timestamp>1349252793310</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 04:26:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349264625331-3</Id><Topic><Title>Which stocks Billionaires Love?</Title><Username>rightdon53</Username><Timestamp>1348905639453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 04:00:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Windows 8 software refresh stretches from mobile device to desktop.

While it has amazing gaming software, and if it monetizes Skype, it will be hitting a home run, Cramer thinks there is a major, persistent problem with MSFT, beyond its association with PCs; Microsoft is not cool. He suggested asking teenagers and college kids to find out if any of them are at all excited about MSFT.</Msg><Username>lindontomson</Username><Timestamp>1349267318648</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 08:28:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349269401732-7</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT Is Looking Good!</Title><Username>mendezbush192</Username><Timestamp>1349268956771</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 08:55:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SPAM SPAM SPAM CRAPOLA</Msg><Username>nw_ripper</Username><Timestamp>1349269401732</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 09:03:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349271139259-8</Id><Title>Wonder if Obama will use the fake southern accent in the debates tonight?</Title><Msg>I've seen carnival huscksters with better acts.</Msg><Username>ghetto_trash</Username><Timestamp>1349271139259</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 09:32:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349272313147-9</Id><Title>WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR GREAT SYSTEM BY VOTING OBAMA TO STAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE</Title><Msg>Obama understands America and it's values.

You fell for it then, I didn't. You fell for it now, I didn't. Didn't work in '08, doesn't work now. Pathetic deflection from Romney's calling half of America freeloaders. A racist will enjoy the tape and not vote for Obama, which he wasn't going to do anyway. A thinker will see the tape and say what does this have to do with anything now. There is nothing at all wrong with it, even from 5 years ago. Besides since then he has done a remarkably good job being President! As for Wright, he isn't President, Obama is. Besides that Wright was a Marine and was not all the right wing wackos makes him out to be. When he made some off comments, which he has the right to do in America, Obama condemned it and left the church. I have been in a number of sermons where I said OMG but I knew that is a person up there talking, not God himself, and it certainly doesn't change the way I am. More pathetic attempts at attacking a man personally, rather than focus on the specifics, like those "not paying taxes" are many who work, elderly, military, and children. Romney doesn't know that. I want a President who does know, Obama.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1349273352627</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 10:09:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349273426939-11</Id><Topic><Title>WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR GREAT SYSTEM BY VOTING OBAMA TO STAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE</Title><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1349272313147</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 09:51:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama doesn't understand America and it's values.

At a Ryan town hall, some guy asked why all those 47% not paying taxes couldn't pay a nominal fee, to feel lke they are part of the ownership of America. Wow Grandma needs to pay a fee now to own her part of America? Grandpa, who worked 70 years, has to pay a fee too? That is not America. Faux news has done a number on a lot of gullible brains out there. Whether you pay 10 cents in income taxes or 10 million dollars, you are still equal to one another, and get the one vote to say how to spend all the money. It isn't your personal ownership of the amount you put in, it is tax based on how much you made.

You earn $20,000, pay 20%, or $4000. You earn $2,000,000, pay 10%, or $200,000. Does the person earning more typically ask more of the government, or the other way around? Right. Frankly, the best system would not tax earnings at all. That in itself is horribly wrong. But if we must loot the wage-earner to support a bloated, inefficient, and corrupt government, it should be as low as possible on those who contribute the most and ask least.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1349275385886</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 10:43:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349276333601-14</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT Is Looking Good!</Title><Username>mendezbush192</Username><Timestamp>1349268956771</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 08:55:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think this is a great resource for any one looking for good reliable information.

In the five months leading up to this year’s 9/11 anniversary, there were two bombings on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and increasing threats to and attacks on the Libyan nationals hired to provide security at the U.S. missions in Tripoli and Benghazi. Details on these alleged incidents stem in part from the testimony of a handful of whistleblowers who approached the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in the days and weeks following the attack on the Benghazi consulate. The incidents are disclosed in a letter to be sent Tuesday to Hillary Clinton from Rep. Darrell Issa, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the oversight committee’s subcommittee that deals with national security. The State Department did not offer comment on the record last night. A picture shows broken furniture outside the U.S. consulate building in Benghazi on September 13, 2012, following an attack on the building late on September 11 in which the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and three other US nationals were killed. (Gianluigi Guercia, AFP / Getty Images) The new information disclosed in the letter obtained by The Daily Beast strongly suggests the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the late Ambassador Chris Stevenswere known by U.S. security personnel to be targets for terrorists. Indeed, the terrorists made their threats openly on Facebook.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1349290884872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 15:01:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349291757473-52</Id><Title>Rumor is the Kenyan will use his fake black accent tonite</Title><Msg>Always enjoy watching a foll making a fool of himself.</Msg><Username>ghetto_trash</Username><Timestamp>1349291757473</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 15:15:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349292560503-53</Id><Topic><Title>The terrorists even posted their threats on Facebook</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1349290884872</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 15:01:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the five months leading up to this year’s 9/11 anniversary, there were two bombings on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi FACT!!!!!!! crapper, I would say this is more than "suggests" Are you a complete idiot or just so ideologued you can think straight?</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1349292560503</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 15:29:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349292674592-54</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor is the Kenyan will use his fake black accent tonite</Title><Username>ghetto_trash</Username><Timestamp>1349291757473</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 15:15:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, he only uses that on black audiences to stir up his black base.

According to the Politico blog, Haim Saban, owner of the television network, backed Hillary Clinton in 2008, but during the summer donated $1 million to groups supporting the campaigns of Democrats. And according to another blog in Spanish of Yahoo, the appointment of Cheryl Saban to the diplomatic post was made last Wednesday, the day before Obama appeared at a forum at the University of Miami hosted by Univision.

DRIVE A DIESEL!</Title><Msg>We develop and commercialize clean technologies that facilitate the more efficient use of natural resources. We are focused on doing so today in the U.S. ethanol industry, where we innovate and offer technologies that improve the profitability of licensed ethanol producers. We invented, developed, commercialized, perfected, and patented new technologies that integrate into the back-end of existing dry mill corn ethanol plants to tap into a new reserve of inedible crude corn oil with an estimated industry-wide output of more than 800 MMGY, an amount capable of offsetting more than about 20 million barrels of fossil fuel-derived crude oil per year. This corn oil is a valuable feedstock for use in the production of advanced carbon-neutral liquid fuels and other biomass-derived alternatives to fossil fuel-based products. Our corn oil extraction technologies are widely considered to be the quickest and best path for margin improvement for corn ethanol producers today. The current market value of corn oil recovered by our licensees ranges from about four to six times higher than its value without use of our patented corn oil extraction processes. Our corn oil extraction technologies increase corn-to-biofuel yields while reducing the energy and greenhouse gas intensity of corn ethanol production for dry mill ethanol producers. These benefits correspond to increased ethanol producer income ranging from about $0.08 to more than $0.20 per gallon of ethanol produced, depending on the extent to which the producer uses our patented and patent-pending extraction technologies; and, ethanol producer paybacks of less than 1 year at current market prices. No technologies have been developed, commercialized and made available to corn ethanol producers in the history of the ethanol industry that begin to approach these results.</Msg><Username>nightser0001</Username><Timestamp>1349318739869</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 22:45:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349318913776-87</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT Is Looking Good!</Title><Username>mendezbush192</Username><Timestamp>1349268956771</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 08:55:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I read your comments with interest - thanks for continuing to post.</Msg><Username>atkinsw85</Username><Timestamp>1349318913776</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-03 22:48:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349321347227-88</Id><Title>PRESIDENT ROMNEY IS IN.</Title><Msg>Companies will prosper again, less regulations, more jobs.
