All Tea Baggers are spoiled sport losers. They hate blacks and can't give credit where is due. GWB was an insult to the "intelligence" level expected from the President of the United States. Hard to believe how dumb that dude is. A real bumpkin elected by low IQ , paranoid, whites and religious zealots. He didn't even win the election but stole it from Al Gore. They threw out enough Miami-Dade ballots, a county with a known liberal bias, to allow Bush to eke out a win in Florida with less than 1000 votes ( county with well over 25,000 votes tossed out; ac county with a heavy liberal bias. That's called a Fix. You're simply another pathetic sore loser. Your days are over so watch how your minions become more marginal as the youth of America isn't buying into your reactionary white boy biases. The Writing is on the Wall.

Obama was President when OBL was killed, but he was killed due to assets left by Bush.

Morgan Cazenove said the Fed probably won’t remove accommodation in the next few quarters as the output gap is “significant” and unemployment rate isn’t likely to hit its Fed target before 2015. Falling commodity prices have also reduced the potential for inflation. The Fed could gradually begin reducing purchases in the fourth quarter, according to J.P. Morgan. 2.Equities have a thick enough valuation cushion to fight a further rise in bond yields. Even if yields on the 10-year Treasury note 10_YEAR +5.02% rise 40 basis points by the end of 2013, the yield gap with stocks would be “exceptionally attractive.” 3.U.S. economy isn’t going to plunge: While data has been mixed, jobless claims — which play into the Fed’s unemployment rate target — have remained below 350,000. “This is healthy and not indicative of a shift in corporate behavior.” Moreover, the housing market has continued its recovery. 4.Finally, recent data out of the euro zone have shown an improvement as preliminary composite PMI rose for the second month and the peripheral countries’ PMI is in line with the euro-zone average, the analysts said.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1369753676334</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 11:07:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369753783963-54</Id><Topic><Title>I know I've said this before but...</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1369753437269</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 11:03:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Imposter in the house!

The reason is that it is packed with many options for consumers to utilize TV, movies, music, Bing, Skype, games. The box itself is packed with innotive technology of voice command and kinect body motion control. This reminds me when apple came out with their first iphone, touchpad. Games using kinect motion control will amaze and dazzle-- this is star trek like , very futuristic. Many more appplications will be applied using kinect. Gaming will be different, cutting middled man, where msft charges subscription fees to game access, like neftflx, cutting out sharing. 5) Skype which has been under utilized will be one of the most used technology in every living room, where video communications can be done right into the 60 inch TV screens in every living room inthe world. 6) Bing will be integrated into the internet access, part of the Xbox experience. Bing is no match for google search at the moment but xbox enforces the use and will compete well with google search engine in the future. Given the abobe scenario, I think msft will be a trillion dollar company by 2014. It is significantly undervalue due to a decade of stagnation. This Titan has begun turning the tides, it is 1990's all over again.</Msg><Username>microsoftd1ck</Username><Timestamp>1369757866641</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 12:17:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369758081862-69</Id><Topic><Title>ossobucco20I2 is a fraud as my alias is ossobucco2012....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1369751459000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 10:30:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I AM NOT A #$%$!</Msg><Username>misterreality14</Username><Timestamp>1369758081862</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 12:21:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369758291574-70</Id><Topic><Title>Don't believe the fake Osso!!!!</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1369752164797</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 10:42:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It already is.

Once consumers start having W8 for their laptops and PCs, they will realizie why pay for a TOY, touchpad that doesn't have the capability of a real computer. Computer makers are no longer making computers with Windows 7 or lower; thus, enforcing the integration of buying W8 to replace ALL old computers. Hence, we have billions of older computers that will eventually be replaced by businesses and homes---forget about fixing the old computers, just get a new W8 machines. Bad for consumers but good for msft.

(2) Obama bailed out the banks with citizens money, leaving most citizens without credit to buy a house (3) Poor job pay (widest disparity in modern histoiry) leaves regular people unable to finance a home (4) Home prices overshot way to the downside. I have a friend who three years ago was buing decent small 3/2 homes for $40-$45 k and renting them instantly at $1K a month. In an investment environment where 5% is good return, you cannot have an investment returning 30% go unnoticed for long. It is reported by an agent I know that hedge funds are buying houses because of the rental market and they could buy for $40 / sf while building costs $85 a s.f. Simply put they went too low just as they went too high so FROM THE BOTTOM they had to rise, nothing to do with Obama policy other than that is why it took so long.</Msg><Username>hawcreekfoundation</Username><Timestamp>1369760807537</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 13:06:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369761871489-83</Id><Title>Whoa!!!!

One needs to get beyond the emotion-based, incomplete liberal thought process, beyond the thrill up the leg from such soaring rhetorical nonsense. It is not our diversity itself that has made this a great country, though our diversity makes us an interesting country, shows the character and depth of our culture. It is the amazing, outrageous, unprecedented FOUNDATIONS OF FREEDOM AND LIBERTY - which establishes 'We The People' as the ruler that holds ultimate power - that our Founders set up as our government THAT ALLOWS OUR RICH DIVERSITY that makes America great! The fact that we as individuals of all races, religions, gender, heritage all have the same freedoms that the government cannot infringe upon sets us apart from any other country that has ever existed. We don't allow a centralized government, dictator, king, or even a president to pick and choose which rights will be granted or not. These foundations ALONE are what have fostered America to be the great nation it is. That is why people from around the world die trying to claim these American foundations, trying to get here on ramshackle rafts, stowing away in the diseased holds of ships or in the inferno of a sealed 18-wheeler trailer, and crossing miles of desert climate. It is also for these foundations that hundreds of thousands of men and women in our armed forces have died defending. We are not simply another country at the global table of nations, nor are we just one side of a war wearing different jerseys than the opposing team. Yesterday's Memorial Day is the pinnacle of American holidays, in honor of those who will never be forgotten by true Americans. It is these foundations that we must protect from today's domestic enemies. You can usually find them spouting meaningless speeches and slogans like 'Yes We Can' and 'Forward.' . And saying things like 'diversity is what has made America great.'</Msg><Username>plmartintexas2012</Username><Timestamp>1369767604202</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 15:00:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369767689971-99</Id><Title>Why Microsoft won't sell off Bing or Xbox</Title><Msg>Google it...

Demand is still weak as we still have 7.5% unemployment and the budget sequester impact is not here fully yet and that is why the Fed will keep the $85 billion a month of Bond purchases intact till Q4/2013 and even then it will reduce it gradually by $5-10 billion per month with pauses in between to make sure the recovery can not be reversed.... Having said that the folks who were on the sideline to buy a house will now get serious as we had 10.9% YoY price increase and that will drive new home construction and stimulate real demand on material and labor which will accelerate the economy as people will buy more cars/trucks/stuff et al; especially as the gasoline prices are quite affordable thus boosting more consumer spending and the happy days will be here once again in The United States Of America. AS the housing prices appreciate and the Stock Market heads North, the wealth effect(s) will get more retail investors into the Stock Market and there goes the cries of the Trolls on this Board....

Of course this does not come close to making up for his disastrous performance in every other area of government. Overall, Obama is a disaster. Bush was the better president, but that's not saying much.</Msg><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1369795776368</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 22:49:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369795990769-180</Id><Topic><Title>loving the WEATHER when it rains MONEY!!</Title><Username>millionairei</Username><Timestamp>1369782004645</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 19:00:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks guys for the advice! i subscribed too</Msg><Username>rogerblack750</Username><Timestamp>1369795990769</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 22:53:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369797061233-181</Id><Title>Plummeting PC sales expose fiction of Windows 8 numbers</Title><Msg>"this topic was deleted" but then you already knew that the LEAPING PRICE FRAUD was just a PUMP2DUMP gee - how effin typical of wallstreet pricing fraud. check info world in a google search on the subject yahoo will otherwise delete the post</Msg><Username>hayzeuschrist</Username><Timestamp>1369797061233</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 23:11:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
