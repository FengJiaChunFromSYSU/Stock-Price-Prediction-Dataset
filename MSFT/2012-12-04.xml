One analyst thinks it may turn out to be one of Microsoft's best selling products over the next two quarters." This is good news for longs, maybe not so great for shorts. But who would be short a stock with 50 billions in cash on hand, a steady income stream, and multiple plays in gaming, cloud, mobile, etc.</Msg><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1354635021635</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:30:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354635059967-40</Id><Title>remember when I dowgrade a stock it could go up but I will take it back down like I did today</Title><Msg>I warn you not to buy or you would lose more money.

You can right click on anything control panel, outlook mail any website and choose pin to start. Then you simply drag the icon to where you want it on the screen. A quick swipe on the screen on the right brings up settings, devices and search. If you type control panel etc into search it comes right up and you can pin it to you big large screen. No start button because the whole screen becomes your start button. A simple click on the desktop and you have all the programs and another version of internet explorer. You have the old win 7 more or less without the start button that it takes a week to get over and then you will not want it. The experience is new, exciting and amazing with the touch screen. No one will ever go back after getting past the initial learning curve. Part of the curve is learning how to set the touch pad and touch screen. If you do not have that right than you are closing things by accident etc. If someone reviews this machine without learning how to use the machine than that persons review and publication are useless and should be avoided. A review of someone that does not know how to use the machine means the publication is a waste of time. Remember that. There is a definite small learning curve. The experience after that is fantastic. The manufacturers were slow to release touch screen machines which is need to enjoy the experience. They are moving at lightning speed all circuits go now. What do you think that means. Apple has dropped from 705 to 575 this year and straight down since the release of I phone 5. Google has gone down from 774 to 688. It is a sign of the times. It is irrelevant if Microsoft is not going up since the release date. It is the market itself and a sign consumers are not spending on anything. Iphone, droid or whatever. I also have Windows 8 phone using the Nokia Lumina 822. Another fantastic experience. If I dropped either machine and broke them I would buy another within 1 hour. I am 100% satisfied with Win 8. The Nokia has voice assisted turn by turn navigation. The camera is amazing, Win8 works flawlessly on the machine. I can run my business on the go now. I have 8 pop 3 email addresses on there and a windows 8 browser that actually works. So if there is a review from a guy that has been using an ipad for 5 years , and does not even learn how to use the machine it is irrelevant. Don't support the publications they write for and the critic will become irrelevant just like a review of a machine you try to use in 5 minutes without learning simple things like where the controls are. Window 8 is the future and watch how young people, students are reacting when they see the start screen. They want it and when there parents are ready to spend again it will take off like the next thing. Apple looks like old technology to me. Apple seems like 2009 and Microsoft feels new and exciting 2013 ish.</Msg><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1354638073542</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:21:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354638143199-55</Id><Topic><Title>just made a mistake and upgraded to 8</Title><Username>asacrowflies</Username><Timestamp>1354634234785</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:17:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ibet u keep going back to No.2</Msg><Username>donjlui0</Username><Timestamp>1354638143199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:22:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354638421672-56</Id><Title>just upgraded to windows 8 and love it!</Title><Msg>Took me about 10 minutes to get used to the new interface, but now I don't even need to use a mouse and I can run real applications, not just angry birds.</Msg><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1354638421672</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:27:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354638723960-57</Id><Topic><Title>just upgraded to windows 8 and love it!</Title><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1354638421672</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 11:27:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I upgraded on my desktop with no touchscreen.

Historically, the term “tax rate” has meant the average or effective tax rate — that is, taxes as a share of income. The broadest measure of the tax rate is total federal revenues divided by the gross domestic product. By this measure, federal taxes are at their lowest level in more than 60 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that federal taxes would consume just 14.8 percent of G.D.P. this year. The last year in which revenues were lower was 1950, according to the Office of Management and Budget. The postwar annual average is about 18.5 percent of G.D.P. Revenues averaged 18.2 percent of G.D.P. during Ronald Reagan’s administration; the lowest percentage during that administration was 17.3 percent of G.D.P. in 1984. In short, by the broadest measure of the tax rate, the current level is unusually low and has been for some time. Revenues were 14.9 percent of G.D.P. in both 2009 and 2010.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1354649421645</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:30:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354649557883-100</Id><Topic><Title>Steve B.

It is clearly, way more complicated than theory. First - assuming all gains in portfolio, need to consider capital gains tax short term holdings vs long term holdings vs tax rate on special dividends. Then, nowadays, corporations have way too much cash on their balance sheet and declaring dividends are not going to drop their stock by theoretically dividend amount, if any at all... Costco is a good example - a large special dividend, and it went up by that amount? how do u figure? if Apple decides to divy out special dividends, it won't drop their price at all because they have too much cash on balance sheet to begin with and declaration of dividends could be seen as a shareholder friendly move.</Msg><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1354655679809</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 16:14:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354656218610-116</Id><Topic><Title>remember when I dowgrade a stock it could go up but I will take it back down like I did today</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1354635059967</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 10:30:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>everyone could see what happen to MSFT when I downgraded the stock. everyone that smart sold.

Then have a touch operating system for tablets and a regular operating system for laptops and desktops. Of course there is Windows 8 Metro for mobile phones and tablets. It just looks so awful that I think the wrong design studio was chosen while the core operation can work. Another mistake is that the Surface that can't be used as a laptop but requires a desk top.

That is why he claims that he can take it up or down because he has no idea what the stock will do and wants to be able to say that he did it regardless. Try to pin him down to a closing price ahead of time and watch him shrink from the challenge. The key to laughing at Raystock is to keep track of his posts because then you will see him claim to buy shares and then when the share price declines either never mention it again or claim that he never owns shares.</Msg><Username>sergeant_sphincter</Username><Timestamp>1354678601405</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 22:36:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354678906912-155</Id><Title>Policy Creates Debt</Title><Msg>Obama inherited two unfunded wars, the Bush tax cuts and an economy in a state of collapse.
