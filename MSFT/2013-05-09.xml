That is where people want the start button (the screen with the tiles). The desktop you are talking about is the old version of Windows running underneath on X86 chips. That is essentially the same as W7. That start button DOES NOT HAVE ANY FUNCTIONALITY TIED TO THE ARM RT (top layer of Windows 8 "Tiles". It is only a link back to the runtime that operates on ARM chips. If you right click it, you have links to the old x86 chips of W7 like the desktop (control panel, etc) of the DESKTOP ONLY. It is NOT A START BUTTON FOR RT W8 ARM. They may be adding a start button on the left of the tile screen that says Start Button and has the Windows logo above it. This will provide shortcuts to things on the arm layer. There are two different layers on Windows 8 professional PC's (Arm &amp; X86. There is only one layer on Windows RT only machines. The people that want a start button are referring to the Windows RT only machines or the Arm layer of the professional machines. The only start button on the professional machines only accesses the old desktop layer which is identical to W7. They want a start button on the screen with the tiles and there are a whole series of machines that do not have the desktop on it only the ARM RT layer.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368093420852</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 05:57:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368094990240-7</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft announces an update &amp; CNBC has to drum up a Slam Job on W8 - It's an update you idiots</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368005265675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 05:27:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"ARM based RT start screen" PC users, desktop or laptop don't care ARM based RT start screen: Windows RT (codenamed Windows on ARM) is a version of Microsoft Windows operating system designed to run on mobile devices. wikipedia</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1368094990240</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 06:23:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368095287881-8</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft announces an update &amp; CNBC has to drum up a Slam Job on W8 - It's an update you idiots</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368005265675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 05:27:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There is one way the start button does work for the Arm (tile layer) runtime if you right click the start button. If you click search you can search the arm layer. Not exactly a start button for arm but you can search for anything you want as long as you change the search between apps, files, etc. People do not want to search for things though, that is why they want a real start button on the arm layer. It is good that you did not know there are two layer though. That means they are doing a pretty good job of making it one machine. It is revolutionary as Microsoft was the first to combine the Arm type chip experience of the Apple, etc with a traditional PC experience. Best of both world on one machine.

As a result i've never had to search help or use the charms bar, which i disabled with a simple registry command. As a result I have a O/S faster, safer and stronger than w7.

It is also fine if you do not understand that the arm and x86 are separate layers accessing separate chips. So the start button does not help those that want the functionality of the old start button on the arm layer Windows RT. That is what will be added. If the current start button for the desktop x86 old layer floats your boat fine. For all the people complaining about no start button on the ARM RT runtime it will be coming on the main start screen and will be the first thing you see on the left hand screen centered and will say START BUTTON. There will be no other tiles in that row only the Start Button that will be added to the RT runtime.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368097398579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 07:03:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368097470122-11</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft announces an update &amp; CNBC has to drum up a Slam Job on W8 - It's an update you idiots</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368005265675</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 05:27:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't say millions don't care just because you do not.

A surface RT laptop is not a mobile device like you say an it runs on ARM. The Surface pro x86 version start button only access desktop features it will not locate tiles on the start screen unless you do it via search. We will have to agree to disagree. I have developers software and have a few things you do not. Do you really think you have a start button no one else has and all the people requesting the start button for the "TILES START SCREEN" don't. Like I said, since I am a programmer/developer I have the development software. I see the button you are referring to, we are just disagreeing on what it does and you do not understand the differences in the Windows 8 RT &amp; Windows 8 Professional versions. Rt = Arm Professional = x86 version via Intel i5 or i7. Microsoft is not the only company making RT Arm only devices. Samsung makes a RT tablet that they hacked a full function of start button into without permission. That is not a Microsoft start button, it is hacked Samsung. I also tested a Samsung Professional version of a tablet and that also has the hacked version of the start button. What I mean by hacked is that is not in the Windows 8 program, it is in the framework of the Samsung machine. So Samsung tablets have a start button that is different. Those machines may have been halted from sale. I am not sure. There was an attempted injunction not from Microsoft but in reference to Apple patents. If you want the start button look at the Samsung Tablets. The are numerous RT ARM versions and Professional X86 versions. Every manufacturer has some it seems. Samsung was the only brand I tested that had a start button hacked into it that operated like the old W7 start button. W8 start button just accesses desktop features only.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368104008581</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 08:53:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368104242984-29</Id><Title>Obama priorities</Title><Msg>When a soldier is killed in the line of duty, his family eventually gets a flag and a note conveying sympathy and respect and from the United States Government.

You're at the meat of it, the fabrication of stories told over and over until they become truth in the mind of the gullible. What is suspected by the RWNJ community? That Obama is for the attack, he watched it and thought it will put him in a bad light, therefore let the attack proceed to show it wasn't really an attack and his remarkable foreign policy record is kept safe. Hilary too, and Obama forced Rice to say something lesser happened because he didn't want his record diminished. Yep, that's what they are saying, and it's impossible for any sane person to believe that.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1368105048816</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 09:10:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368105715726-33</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi is proving to be a source of much fukery for RWNJ</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1368025434531</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 11:03:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yah but Pres Obama the very next morning, long before the Rice TV show comments, said the attack was an act of terror, that they were attackers.

Economists forecast 335,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.

I have maybe 300 tiles on my start screen.

JUST HOLD THE WINDOWS KEY DOWN AND PRESS X. There you just got a secret bypass that you seem to like.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368123042057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 14:10:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368123388575-128</Id><Title>Laptop sales are down sequentially quarter over quarter as Surface Pro and Convertible Laptops are....</Title><Msg>Staring to redefine Mobility aka BYOD with real capabilities as a tool thus killing iToy based gadgets....

Is it an Xbox or a 64 bit 1.6 gh 8 core w/a hard drive running Windows 8. Yes, running Windows 8 &amp; AMD chips. Will it have and HDMI input cable pass through for guess what allowing your cable or internet TV connection. Your TV is going to get pretty cool pretty quick. So now you will have a Windows Phone, Surface and Xbox all running Windows 8. Should not just say Surface better to say every manufacturer and his brother making Windows 8 devices. Don't forget the 7 inch tablet coming that guess what will run Windows 8. There is going to be a lot of fun going on man. The XBOX experience is on the Windows 8 phone &amp; operating systems already. Now the missing link of hooking it up to your tv, cable and enjoying the Blu Ray. It has wifi so if you do not have a tv with a HDMI Input or cable you can still access the internet. Looks like Windows 8 it sure bringing a lot of new things despite the haters trying to hate it. Now you will have the ultimate Multi Media experience with Internet/Cable/Tv. Those HDMI cables can cost a lot of money at some of these places. I just bought one for $40.00 or $50.00 that was for high something or other. That is kind of crazy. Oh, I hope they can get all this going by Christmas for Durango and not 2014 ver. I know the cell phone guys wait for announce dates and then 1 up them. Nokia announces a Window's look alike Asha phone today (Wonder how mr softy felt about that?) and Amazon announces a 3d phone on the same day. Facebook reduces Home phones to .99 cents. I have a feeling Google TV &amp; Sony will announce something around the 21st to rival the Xbox 720.

That is not keyboard shortcuts. You are accessing the registry and that is the same way it is programmed into it at Microsoft just in code behind.

Anyway dumbaxs I will let you edit the context menu you refer to as the start button on your own since you say anyone can do it. LOL, I think I may even create a start button app right now and get it into the Windows Store for free. It will be the same routine I mentioned above to edit the ContextMenuHandler above only in c# code behind in xaml.

Quoting: "By Evan Niu, CFA "May 9, 2013 | Comments (0) "Software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) made headlines earlier this week when it boasted 100 million license sales of Windows 8 since the controversial new platform launched six months ago. Microsoft also outlined its plan to release a public preview of Windows 8.1, codenamed "Blue," which may address some of the platform's weaknesses. "That's up from the 60 million figure that Microsoft touted in January. That's also roughly the same pace that the flagship operating system's predecessor saw when Windows 7 was unleashed upon the world back in 2009. "Keep in mind that these figures that Microsoft shares are based on sell-in to its distribution channel, which includes sales to retailers and OEMs. Some of these licenses are sold directly to end users, including upgrades, but most people generally don't buy copies of Windows directly. "When it comes to actual sell-through and consumer usage, Microsoft is likely doing much worse than its statistics would suggest. Moor Insights &amp; Strategy principal analyst Patrick Moorhead estimates that 41% of those Windows 8 licenses aren't in play right now." ____________________________________ I and others have pointed this out before, but it's worthwhile pointing out that it's not just us who know it.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368141504993</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:18:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368141517520-184</Id><Topic><Title>I love how the option sellers write a new article every 5 seconds about windows 8</Title><Username>douglas7white</Username><Timestamp>1368140698167</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 19:04:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And I love how their desperation plays out whenever MSFT dips even a bit...like they have any hope whatsoever at this point.

After Watergate there was a long lull as details emerged. So fellow Dems are circling the wagons to defend the Liar in Chief so he may not be forced to resign, but at least history will report what a poser he is.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368144801100</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:13:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368144972491-196</Id><Title>Osso-bumble is a dumb M$hill idiot</Title><Msg>And a complete waste of air.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368144972491</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:16:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368145145288-197</Id><Topic><Title>hawcreek resigned</Title><Username>nophones4sale</Username><Timestamp>1368090723153</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 05:12:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL pot meet kettle,Exactly like you mewling Quim.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1368145145288</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:19:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368145325725-198</Id><Topic><Title>Laptop sales are down sequentially quarter over quarter as Surface Pro and Convertible Laptops are....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368123388575</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 14:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The three stooges wontard/heretard/penguintard LOL!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1368145325725</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:22:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368145449427-199</Id><Topic><Title>ballmer</Title><Username>beenhereforever</Username><Timestamp>1368128127851</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 15:35:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have been making some great money lately but I have a large amount of shares because I have had it since the beginning and the 2 for 1 splits made the shares build up.

You see change is hard and in IT is next to impossible and as our detractors have proven by their constant Windows-8 bashing for "removing the start button", there is no way CIOs are going to change 30 years of training and database management and go buy into a new OS.... Steve Jobs understood that, so he positioned Mac for consumers, small businesses and some specialty trade like Graphics et al.... Then he came up with his big idea, the Tablet, capitalizing on his iPhone base and started the "Death of PC" gimmick and the cheerleaders on Wall Street took his song and created a false doomsday scenario (Kind of like Y2K BS and the End of Times nonsense).... SO Mr. Softy was a bit late to the show and decided to really stick it to the Death of the PC crowd and decided to "Integrate Desktop with Mobility"; and we are in the final stretch of killing Steve Job's Clever but False bet. Don't get me wrong, I like Steve Jobs as an innovator, but a shrewd and dirty player in business and am surprised to see how the Google boys used him and his ideas and screwed him at the end (whatever comes around goes around and the Google boys will get their chance to get screwed by someone more devious than them). AT any rate, we will dominate the Desktop and Mobility now that more Hardware folks are on board with Windows Phones, Tablets and Convertible Laptops.

JD Howard, vice president of business operations &amp; worldwide business development at Lenovo's Mobile Internet and Digital Home (MIDH) business group, told ZDNet Asia in an interview here that as a device manufacturer, the company will go where the market leads in terms of deciding which operating system (OS) to include in its handsets. Android is currently "very solid" and Lenovo is riding the OS' success with the latest portfolio of six phones it unveiled at this year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES), including its flagship K900 smartphone and the enterprise-ready IdeaPhone P770, he said. However, Howard said should consumers be concerned over any possible security vulnerabilities in Android OS, or that the phones are made in China, the security features in Windows Phone 8 should help mitigate many of their fears. This is why the MIDH unit has put in a proposal to develop smartphones running Windows Phone 8 OS to the management, given that it is Lenovo's planning cycle now. He said its fiscal year ends in March 2013, and any concrete decisions will only be known in April. That said, should the management give the greenlight, there is a "good chance" consumers will see a Lenovo-branded Windows Phone 8 handset in 2013, the vice president stated". SO folks now that Huawei has unveiled their WP-8, next up is Lenovo.

They blast Crowley for saying the exact truth, because Romney looked very very bad, That's the mentality we're dealing with. Can you imagine Romney making decisions, a man who didn't hear or verify himself the President;s speech, but got the lie from elsewhere, and tried to use it in a Presidential debate, in front of the whole country. That was historic ineptitude and disqualification to be in any office, let alone President. The man didn't verify the story before accusing someone? Can you imagine the consequences of that as Pres? Romney went to Harvard Law Schol, and didn't learn something every average person knows to do, verify? Amazing incompetence. The President was concerned with announcing a tragedy where lives were lost, and that we will never give in to terrorism. The terrorists will be found, and he wasn't remotely talking about the guy who made the video. That has to be the most stupid idea a human brain could come up with. The President has never alluded to or in any way stated we have eliminated al qaeda, so he is not protecting any statement. That's another beyond stupid comment the rwnjs come up with. They are coming up with this stuff themselves, the rwnjs, none of it has any resemblance to what the President says or does.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1368150916108</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 21:55:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368150970297-213</Id><Title>Benghazi is a stinky thread that RWNJ hold onto for source of online fukery</Title><Msg>Look for em to keep stiring this dying fire for quite some time</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1368150970297</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 21:56:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368151078246-214</Id><Title>hawfeces your back, what happened, did an_obama_nation get banned</Title><Msg>or did your alzheimers clear up.
