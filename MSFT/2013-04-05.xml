After almost xp some years? I do have Win8 on my desktop. I hesitated because of all the negative press. Well, I love it. And I get around Win8 with a mouse just as fast as I ever did anywhere else ... actually faster. Besides, these new computers scream ... and I look forward to getting my new laptop (hurry up INTC) .. and a full feature tablet. The only explanation I have for the MSFT bashing is that there is too much money in the wrong stocks and time is needed to re-allocate (and they have time because of INTC) ... Win8 is slick and works across all platforms. I still say, if you have Win8 on your desktop or laptop, you'll want it on all devices.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1365135118348</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 00:11:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365135428610-3</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft is in Trouble</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365116249396</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 18:57:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because over 50% of tablet market is iOS and most of remainder is Android.

"Then again, it makes sense that Microsoft should close at its lowest level since December of last year. This was supposed to be a turning point for the company. Windows 8 was supposed to raise the bar in operating systems, breathing new life into fading PC-manufacturers. Windows Phone 8 was supposed to give the company a shot at gaining serious market share in the booming smartphone realm.

Only selling 1000 confirms there is a demand for them at that price, but selling even 100 would more strongly indicate there is a valid demand.] Lets say there are 1000 market participants in the room and each has a basket of the items. At 10:00 AM they are trading for $20.00. The price is steady and the number of sales is small. At 11:47:30 News breaks that a storm in the Floriduh has destroyed a sizable portion of the same items. A few sales occur for around $30.00 after the news as the group has collectively estimated the worth of the items higher. At 1:20:22 PM news hits that a company has an entire warehouse full of these items and a then there are a few sales around $22.00 as the group collectively reevaluates the price. It would seem the price can change dramatically with few actual transactions when information is efficiently distributed. Low trading volume indicates agreement on price. High trading volume indicates disagreement on price. Exactly what can happens in computer traded markets.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1365172571810</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 10:36:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365174224297-42</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft in trouble?

It's a good thing he is doing, and I believe it is after tax money too. He's just a great man.

Android fell to 51.7 percent over the same period, down from 53.7 percent." Thanks for the post, wally. You've verified for this board that in spite of the vagaries of the market place and short term trend analyses, Android is still at the top of the heap with 51.7% to iPhone's 38.9% and MS' offerings don't even rate an honorable mention in the same breath with these industry leaders.

Quoting: "Internet search giant Google Inc. (GOOG) announced the launch of a notebook, which will be powered by its mobile OS Android in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. "The new laptop will run on Google’s flagship mobile Android OS and may come with a touchscreen. Users will be able to access all apps available in the Android app market through their laptop or ‘Androidbook’. "In Feb 2013, Google started shipping the Chromebook Pixel priced at $1,299. This version comes with a high-resolution touchscreen, Intel (INTC) Core i5 processor and built-in 4G LTE cellular connectivity through Verizon (VZ) wireless network. Earlier, in 2011, Google launched Chromebook featuring the Google Chrome OS. "According to DigiTimes, Google has managed to sell 500,000 Chromebooks to date and expects to cross the 1 million mark by the end of 2013. Although Google is looking to get its devices into the maximum number of hands on the strength of the Chrome OS, its plans are clearly at an early stage compared to Microsoft (MSFT), which sold 40 million Windows 8 licenses worldwide in the very first month." _______________________________________ So, there you have it, folks. Android is moving upmarket. Android is Linux. And because Google will be behind this product, Microsoft CANNOT blockade it, the way it has blockaded sales of Linux-based PC's through retail vendors for more than a decade. It will get into users' hands, and users will use it and like it and want more. Microsoft's grip on the desktop market is ending.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365179502270</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:31:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365179941641-61</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Could Be Obsolete By 2017: Gartner Report</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365119416013</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 19:50:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Who will follow after AAPL &amp; GOOG ?"

In this case there is no profit from trading at the new price. I found the theory put up on the trading sites but then I wouldn't grant them much credibility as they are selling an ethos and products to the gullible.
