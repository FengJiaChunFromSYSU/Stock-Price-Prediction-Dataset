So what?&lt; Then you agree with me and not inspector shethead who believes if someone builds the newest fastest "SUPERCOMPUTER" for say $50 MILLION DOLLARS, they can proceed to download &amp; install a copy of LINUX or Windows Server "as is" and the machine will be optimized for peak Efficiency regardless of the unique hardware on that particular "SUPERCOMPUTER". Of course any respectable RETARD knows the $50 MILLION DOLLAR "SUPERCOMPUTER" would need it's very own customized O/S TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT'S hardware, but the inspector is not a respectable RETARD. And in conclusion, the $50 MILLION DOLLAR "SUPERCOMPUTER" probably run a stock copy of Linux or Win Server but it would be operating in a handicapped state of existence.</Msg><Username>krarners_ghost</Username><Timestamp>1344210297000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 19:44:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344213470000-40</Id><Title>Sikh Temple in Oak Creek Shooting</Title><Msg>The shooting at the Sikh Temple in Oak Creek about 10:15 a.m. Sunday that left seven people dead, including the shooter, and three people injured is being treated as a domestic terrorist incident, Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said. http://www.jsonline.com/news/crime/reports-of-people-shot-at-sikh-temple-in-oak-creek-qc6cgc0-165059506.html Sikh Temple shooting inspired by the far right?

Top Obama campaign officials told Fox News in interviews that the lawsuit in no way tries to restrict the voting rights of military members. All they are trying to do is even the playing field for all voters in Ohio by allowing early voting up until Monday for everyone, including members of the military, because they believe a two-tiered, early-voting process is unfair.

Now, the odds are closer to 1 in 10, according to the study by NASA scientist James Hansen. He says that statistically what's happening is not random or normal, but pure and simple climate change. "This is not some scientific theory. We are now experiencing scientific fact," Hansen told The Associated Press in an interview. Hansen is a scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and a professor at Columbia University. He has called for government action to curb greenhouse gases for years. While his study was published online Saturday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, it is unlikely to sway opinion among the remaining climate change skeptics. http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/05/13129330-blame-blistering-heat-waves-on-global-warming-study-says?lite &gt;&gt;&gt;remaining climate change skeptics&lt;&lt; Of course not!
