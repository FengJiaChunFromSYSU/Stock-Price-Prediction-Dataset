CBP is under DHS. Any federal agency that has a gun, has a qualification on that gun. The qualifications have to be done with the issue ammunition. As in, you can't qual with 124gr FMJ in 9mm. You have to use 124gr JHP. DHS has over 200,000 employees. I doubt all have to qualify in a pistol every quarter, but many do. A typical qual would run about 50 rounds and on average most people take 2 attempts to pass. So if half DHS has to qualify, that is 100,000x50roundsx2attemptsx4times a year. So 40 million rounds a year just to maintain the basic shooting requirements of DHS internally. Then there is the fact that DHS covers anti-terrorist funding and training and give grants of ammo, funding and training to state and county law enforcement. Just supplying the ammo to local PDs for a yearly qual and some minimal training would take over a billion rounds. Having worked directly with more than 1 federal agency, I can assure you DHS is not capable of stretching their ammo budget and keeping the reason from the public if the reason is as interesting as they know something we don't.

Facebook Share LinkedIn Google +1 0 Comments Print QUEUE Q .. Microsoft Corp.’s Skype unit, which includes Lync software for corporate instant messaging and Internet calling, is approaching $2 billion in annual sales. The division is getting close to the size of Microsoft’s SharePoint business, which focuses on tools that help employees collaborate, according to Giovanni Mezgec, a general manager in the Skype division. SharePoint will bring in more than $2 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, Microsoft said in November. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has 5 million users for Lync, its Internet-calling product for companies. That’s up from 3 million 14 months ago, Mezgec said. Microsoft wants to sell more Lync software to corporations to catch up with Cisco Systems Inc. in the market for Internet telephony and communications, which Forrester Research Inc. predicts will be worth $14.5 billion in 2015. Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, paid $8.5 billion to buy Skype in 2011 to add the most popular Web-calling service, targeted at consumers. Skype had about $800 million in sales when Microsoft acquired the company. Of the 100 largest companies, by Fortune magazine’s ranking, 90 are Lync customers, Mezgec said. By June, Lync users will be able to connect to Skype for telephony, instant messaging, and to see whether contacts are online, according to a blog post by Skype President Tony Bates, who is speaking today at a Lync conference in San Diego. Mobile versions of Lync for Microsoft’s Windows Phone and Apple Inc.’s iOS will be available early next month. An application for Google Inc.’s Android smartphones is planned for a month later, Bates said.</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1361300105179</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:55:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361301956197-65</Id><Topic><Title>Didn't we close at 28.01 on Fri??!!</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1361297155194</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:05:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your biggest problem is that you are a poser.

John Brennan receives a healthy amount, and it seems well deserved. "Because John Brennan is running his own private war, he is not going through the normal chain of command, and operations are not de-conflicted. Ambassador Stevens, for instance, was not read on to the JSOC operations in Libya. He was kept in the dark and ultimately killed in a retaliation that he never could have seen coming. " -If the CIA is not gathering intelligence on potential attacks via HUMINT or SIGINT, who the hell is? Was there any of that going on? There had to have been a catalyst, even if the bulk of the assault didn't take place until hours after the initial breach. There is always a thread running somewhere. Our intelligence assets were either kept completely in the dark by the coordinators of this assault, or someone dropped the ball The Benshzai Report is a new tell all book by two Seals that tell of the secret, private war run out of the White House. Idon't care about that, but that they didn't have back up for our people in the most dangerous part of the world is a catastropic failure and those responsible should be dealt with.

Facebook Share LinkedIn Google +1 0 Comments Print QUEUE Q .. Microsoft Corp.’s Skype unit, which includes Lync software for corporate instant messaging and Internet calling, is approaching $2 billion in annual sales. The division is getting close to the size of Microsoft’s SharePoint business, which focuses on tools that help employees collaborate, according to Giovanni Mezgec, a general manager in the Skype division. SharePoint will bring in more than $2 billion in revenue for the current fiscal year, Microsoft said in November. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has 5 million users for Lync, its Internet-calling product for companies. That’s up from 3 million 14 months ago, Mezgec said. Microsoft wants to sell more Lync software to corporations to catch up with Cisco Systems Inc. in the market for Internet telephony and communications, which Forrester Research Inc. predicts will be worth $14.5 billion in 2015. Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, paid $8.5 billion to buy Skype in 2011 to add the most popular Web-calling service, targeted at consumers. Skype had about $800 million in sales when Microsoft acquired the company. Of the 100 largest companies, by Fortune magazine’s ranking, 90 are Lync customers, Mezgec said. By June, Lync users will be able to connect to Skype for telephony, instant messaging, and to see whether contacts are online, according to a blog post by Skype President Tony Bates, who is speaking today at a Lync conference in San Diego. Mobile versions of Lync for Microsoft’s Windows Phone and Apple Inc.’s iOS will be available early next month. An application for Google Inc.’s Android smartphones is planned for a month later, Bates said.

No, the content of yours is the problem. The meaning of stereotype is taught in what, 4th grade? If it were possible to multiple vote, the republicans would be first in line doing it. All these decades of voting, and no one thought of ways to prevent the casting of more than one vote. Sure, if your mother dies within a certain period of time, and votes by mail, you could fraudulenty send in her ballot. Sure you could steal another person's ballot and forge their signature. They won't notice no one would notice they didn't vote and their ballot is misssing. A big fat lie, all of it.

Comments 0 Print Text Melowese Richardson is the Ohio poll worker who admitted to casting two votes in November for President Obama. Now, Ohio officials are investigating if she voted in the names of four other people as well and cast a total of six ballots in the 2012 election, according to Fox News. The investigation is part of a wider one into a number of cases of alleged voter fraud in Hamilton County, Ohio. Richardson says she filled out and submitted an absentee ballot on her granddaughter’s behalf, and her granddaughter has confirmed that claim, saying, “It wasn’t a big deal.” Furthermore: Three other absentee ballots in the names of different people were submitted to the Board of Elections from Richardson’s address on Nov. 1. Officials say the handwriting on those ballots is similar and that they were all received together, on the same day that Richardson’s absentee ballot arrived at the office. Richardson maintains that some of the other voters live at her house. Attempts by Fox News to reach Richardson were unsuccessful, but she claimed to the local station that the votes were “absolutely legal votes.” Richardson is currently facing charges of voter fraud but maintains her innocence. “I can’t understand these charges against me of voter fraud,” she told Cincinnati’s Channel 9 News. “Have they never heard of . . . overlooking mailing in a ballot or registering to vote at a precinct after you’ve forgotten that you’ve mailed in a ballot or you’ve been told that the ballot may be too late?” The local news report below includes an interview with Richardson, who is set to appear before Ohio’s Hamilton County Board of Elections on Friday, as well as footage from the testimony of five other Ohio voters accused of voting, or attempting to vote, twice.

Secure Hardened Enterprise Technology? You should have revealed your depth in this area before now. Why hide your candle under a bushel basket like that? No need to be embarrassed if you have those kind of skills. Maybe for all the other reasons, but not for that. And thanks for pointing out the Foundation On Advanced Design. It must be nice to see that MSFT has finally capitulated and gone with better technology ; stuff they couldn't develop on their own and had to just buy and borrow. Just the kind of thing needed for a multi-billion dollar profit center. At least it will +become+ a profit center once the initial outlay of $8.5 billion and any subsequent investment is recovered. Your post really makes you seem like a Dynamic Information Knowledge-worker. You may now resume dreaming even if you don't actually go back to sleep.</Msg><Username>fan_tazer</Username><Timestamp>1361330445913</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 22:20:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361330674153-104</Id><Topic><Title>Should Men Over 65 Be Allowed To Vote?</Title><Username>monsignor_whiteowl</Username><Timestamp>1361310868545</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:54:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not until YOU turn 65.</Msg><Username>papa.weelee</Username><Timestamp>1361330674153</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 22:24:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361330941195-105</Id><Topic><Title>DELL may say Windows8 sales are great</Title><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1361307485475</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:58:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I got your earnings right here!
