I can cancel and move Millions in Ad money if there is not a change in your nightly Primetime News. Shame on you. Excellence is never an accident. Here listed below are some of Obama's failures you never report on but voters are suffering due to his bad choices. God Bless the USA!!! 1. Turned a $500B annual deficit into $1.5T. 2. Turned a $9T debt into a $16T debt. 3. Turned $1.83 per gallon gas into $4 a gallon. 4. Turned 7% unemployment into 8.3% and spent $9T to get us there. 5. Stopped the war in Afghanistan, not. 6. Closed Gitmo, not. 7. Banned water boarding and replaced it with execution without due process. 8. Tried to get Mexico to adopt our 2nd amendment by sending hundreds of guns there. 9. Had a 400% increase in domestic terrorism over Bush. 10. Bailed out the UAW at GM with our tax money we will never get back in my lifetime. 11. BK'd the bond holders at GM. 12. Increased food stamp enrollment to its highest ever level over 1 in 7 Americans. 13. Increased the number of people on SSI to record levels while cutting SS by $500B. 14. Played more rounds of golf than any President in history 105 at last count. 15. Taken taxpayer funded 17 lavish vacations more than any President in history. 16. Obama wasted over $1 Billion on Bankrupt Solar companies to date. Above are just 16 reasons why I could never vote for Obama in 2012 and your bias nightly news gives me reason number17.

It’s time for a realty check. During the Bush administration both taxes and regulations were cut and look what happened; our country experienced slow growth, falling real wages, slow employment growth, a very substantial increase in our national debt, and the “Greatest Recession” in many of our lifetime. These facts can not be disputed. While I believe that the tax code should be completely revised and that some regulations need to be reviewed and perhaps eliminated, the Republican Party apparently does not understand that it is demand that creates growth, and consequently jobs; not lower taxes. If products are in demand and individuals have the funds available they will purchase them. Unfortunately over the past decade real wages have gone down as our country has transitioned from an industrial economy to a service economy. Adding to the problem has been the outsourcing of jobs overseas and the housing crash all of which have resulted in less cash in the pocketbook of the consumer. As a result, overall demand is down and consequently employment. What our country has to do is to get more money into the hands of the consumer. This can be done either through tax policy, public work projects, or an increase in the minimum wage. Reducing uncertainty and developing long-term solutions to the problems facing our country would also give our economy a psychological boost.</Msg><Username>dwb360</Username><Timestamp>1346347341429</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:22:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346348141618-62</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY STOP THE #$%$ RELEASE TAXES NOW</Title><Username>cohenjoe31</Username><Timestamp>1346330326639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 08:38:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>-------- TAX REVOLUTION, THANKS TO ROMNEY.....</Msg><Username>cohenjoe31</Username><Timestamp>1346348141618</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 13:35:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346348158647-63</Id><Topic><Title>President Obama</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1346329607947</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-30 08:26:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The terrorists are praying right along with you.

Income inequality has become a familiar theme in this presidential election and the majority of Americans believe the growing wealth divide is "a bad thing" for the country, according to a new report by the Pew Research Center. Kim Parker, an associate director at the Center and lead author of the report, polled more than 2,500 Americans last month about tax rates, social class and partisan biases. She found that wealthy Americans may be vilified by their societal peers but they're also viewed as more intelligent and hardworking. Parker joined The Daily Ticker to discuss the findings and what they imply about the state of America today. America's View of The Rich The Pew report found that many Americans view the rich differently than other people.
