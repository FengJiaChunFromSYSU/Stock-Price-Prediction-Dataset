Today NTWK is a much stronger company with far more revenue sources including new Cloud Divisions. Unlike 2010, NTWK today has the flexibility to deliver reliable software products and services not only from Pakistan but also from excellence centers located in Bangkok, Beijing, the US, and the UK. The float today is 1/10 of what it was then and 2013 revenues are expected to breakaway into the mid $40 million for the first time in company history. During 2010 (and 2007) NTWK's market cap reached over $100 million on 50% lower revenues of what is projected for 2013. During the September 4Q CC NTWK officials stated that revenues are expected to reach $100 Million in 2015 up significantly from the $38 Million reported in 2012. They also expect margins to continue to go up as the high-margin Cloud divisions keep continuing exponentially to revenues. MUST READ ……This Week’s Analysts Comments on Upgrade: We project 13% annual growth to FY14 from FY10 reflecting 80 significant NFS legacy customers in FY14, up from 52, 37, and 28 in FY12, FY11, and FY10, respectively. The new Vroozi Cloud Division contributed $1.3 million in FY12. We expect at least $4 million in FY13 and $6 million to FY14 Our price target is based on the average forward 2013 P/E multiple of 13.2X (up from 12.8X in August 2012). NTWK is trading at 6.4X our FY13 projections. We are forecasting EPS of $0.85 per share. We applied an 11X multiple to our FY13 EPS forecast. We anticipate a richer multiple as earnings momentum builds in FY13. The company guidance calls for $1/share net income in 2013. NTWK is entering FY13 with a $25 million backlog and approximately $100 million in qualified leads. One quarter of the backlog is from four new NFS platform customer implementations that began in 4Q12. In August 2011, NetSol launched its Cloud Vroozi Division, an e-procurement search tool for SAP supplier relationship management (SRM) users. SAP AG is a global vendor of enterprise management systems that has the largest market share (24%) based on a worldwide Gartner survey. Vroozi should provide sales diversification and a higher margin recurring revenue stream. The Vroozi division contributed $1.3 million in FY12 sales and is expected to grow to $4 million in revenues in 2013 NTWK announced its 2nd Cloud Division last week offering an array of products and services to capture a greater % of the cloud applications in North America. The company is implementing this division using their significant software development capabilities and infrastructure. === MORE NTWWK HIGHLIGHTS: - Company projects Doubling/Tripling revenues and net income by 2015 - Significant Institutional investor ownership and growing - Insiders bought over 5% of the Outstanding shares the last 2 years and never sold a single share - Total share count is only 7.5 million shares.

They will hit families and small businesses in three great waves on January 1, 2013: First Wave: Expiration of 2001 and 2003 Tax Relief In 2001 and 2003, the GOP Congress enacted several tax cuts for small business owners, families, and investors (later re-upped by President Obama and Democrat Congress in 2010). The following tax hikes will occur on January 1, 2013: Personal income tax rates will rise on January 1, 2013. The top income tax rate will rise from 35 to 39.6 percent (this is also the rate at which the majority of small business profits are taxed). The lowest rate will rise from 10 to 15 percent. All the rates in between will also rise. Itemized deductions and personal exemptions will again phase out, which has the same mathematical effect as higher marginal tax rates. The full list of marginal rate hikes is below: -The 10% bracket rises to a new and expanded 15% -The 25% bracket rises to 28% -The 28% bracket rises to 31% -The 33% bracket rises to 36% -The 35% bracket rises to 39.6% Higher taxes on marriage and family coming on January 1, 2013. The “marriage penalty” (narrower tax brackets for married couples) will return from the first dollar of taxable income. The child tax credit will be cut in half from $1000 to $500 per child. The standard deduction will no longer be doubled for married couples relative to the single level.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348239669039</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:01:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348240000084-29</Id><Title>4 Americans dead</Title><Msg>because of 1 Kenyan</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1348240000084</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 11:06:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348240087626-30</Id><Topic><Title>Obama reveals more of his inner thoughts and frustrations with his 'outside job' comment</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1348221368444</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 05:56:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He was talkng about voting obviously, given the harmful demeanor of the republican party.

Eli Lake on the continuing collapse of the official U.S. line. Ten days after the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, the White House’s official story about the incident appears to be falling apart. Campaign State of Play In this Sept. 14, 2012 file photo, President Barack Obama, accompanied by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, speaks during a Transfer of Remains Ceremony at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., marking the return to the United States of the remains of the four Americans killed this week in Benghazi, Libya. (Carolyn Kaster / AP Photo) In the days following the killing of the U.S. ambassador and two ex-Navy SEALs, President Obama and top State Department officials portrayed the attack as a spontaneous reaction to an Internet video depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammad as a lascivious brute. The protests, White House spokesman Jay Carney said last week, were “in response to a video—a film—that we have judged to be reprehensible and disgusting.” Now there is mounting evidence that the White House’s initial portrayal of the attacks as a mere outgrowth of protest was incorrect—or, at the very least, incomplete. The administration’s story itself has recently begun to shift, with Matthew Olsen, the director of the National Counter-Terrorism Center, telling Congress on Wednesday that the attackers may have had links to al Qaeda and Carney characterizing the incident as a “terrorist attack.” (Hillary Clinton announced on Thursday that she was putting together a panel to look into the incident.) But other indications that the White House’s early narrative was faulty are also beginning to emerge. One current U.S. intelligence officer working on the investigation into the incident told The Daily Beast that the attackers had staked out and monitored the U.S. consulate in Benghazi before the attack, a move that suggests pre-planning. What’s more, two U.S. intelligence officials told The Daily Beast that the intelligence community is currently analyzing an intercept between a Libyan politician whose sympathies are with al Qaeda and the Libyan militia known as the February 17 Brigade—which had been charged with providing local security to the consulate. In the intercept, the Libyan politician apparently asks an officer in the brigade to have his men stand down for a pending attack—another piece of evidence implying the violence was planned in advance. (Plenty of Libyans, of course, did try to protect the consulate. “Many of those Libyans died in the gunfight fighting off the attackers,” one of the officials said. “But there were some bad apples there as well.”)</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348259855960</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 16:37:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348261650403-55</Id><Title>Romney and Ryan playing choking games to get high?</Title><Msg>Those two dudes are really talking stupid lately.</Msg><Username>penelope_poozer</Username><Timestamp>1348261650403</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 17:07:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348262384978-56</Id><Title>With all the bridges falling apart put our people back to work Pass the #$%$ jobs bill. #$%$ you Libertarian/K0*ch funded right wing theories.</Title><Msg>Tell the Grover Norquist controlled House to stop obstructing!</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1348262384978</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 17:19:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348263638948-57</Id><Topic><Title>Listen to the Musllim from Kenya speak of his saviour as "the prophet Muhammed."</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1348257968226</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 16:06:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I urinate on bibles.

It just stand to reason that Microsoft will switch to a winning phone operating system. After all; Google purchase what is now the Android operating system for over 4 millions in cash 3 years ago. Now; if Microsoft took the deal since it was offer to them in the first place; history would have been alot different! Especially for the hardware manufacturers like Nokia!</Msg><Username>zzzzqqqzz</Username><Timestamp>1348279372762</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 22:02:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348279515623-73</Id><Topic><Title>Real Scientists know polar ice levels neither support or debunk warming</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1348162982564</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 13:43:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Take the Great Lakes for an example first Arctic and Antarctic air is cold very cold, even if you warm Arctic air up ten degrees(not that it happened) it is still very cold. Whenever the Great Lakes don't freeze over due to warm water, this condition occurs about every ten years. Cold Arctic air sweeps over the ice free lakes sucking up moisture. That moisture crystallizes to snow, that snow is then dumped over the east coast leaving NYC under 3-4 feet of powder(ok I exaggerated with 3-4'). and that is how you get new ice with a warmer climate. But I did not say new ice, Antarctic could be going bald not unlike some of the people posting here, it is shedding the ice it has into the seas.</Msg><Username>notahchort</Username><Timestamp>1348279515623</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 22:05:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348280413538-74</Id><Title>Who wrote the Forbes article about record sea ice?

Another chunk (about third) of it went into tax cuts. At the start of the stimulus we were losing about 600k jobs a month. The stimulus slowed the loss down almost immediately. If he had cut taxes like Mitt said he would have done instead of the stimulus the entire country would be out of work by now.</Msg><Username>notahchort</Username><Timestamp>1348280565484</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-21 22:22:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348280837454-76</Id><Topic><Title>Real Scientists know polar ice levels neither support or debunk warming</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1348162982564</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 13:43:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who wrote the Forbes article about record sea ice?
