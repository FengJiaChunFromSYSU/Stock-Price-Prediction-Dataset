Facts don't lie, but you do, big time. Obama doesn't lie, I have actually listened to his speeches. He is one very honest man. Mccain et al are senators, they want another republican senator to replace the supposed new sec of state democtrat Kerry. Rice was fouling up their plan. I hope Obama picks someone other than Kerry, and a woman. You can rant on Obama all day and night and it isn't going to change a fact, and that he is President for two terms.

China has cheap labor is why US comapnies go there, the Unions and taxes didn't "make" them go there. Profit and the love of money made them go there. Patriotic companies are "coming back."

You can not substantiate the truth of your statements that fewer guns correlate to fewer gun deaths because the stats for the USA vs Europe which has a lot fewer guns and which has meaningful gun laws are 10,000 to 15000 gun deaths per year vs a couple of hundred for Europe which you can find posted all over the internet if you are too lazy to research it any other way. Concealed carry reducing gun deaths is an NRA lie- once again just try and substantiate this lie.- finally as difficult as it may be for you- try to do your own thinking- stop being the pawn of the super rich armaments industry and the NRA and be your own man for a change</Msg><Username>whsteffan</Username><Timestamp>1355543790260</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 22:56:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355545683441-100</Id><Topic><Title>Renewed challenge for gun control advocates here using tragedy to promote</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1355530288792</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 19:11:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>People you are just stupid idiots.
