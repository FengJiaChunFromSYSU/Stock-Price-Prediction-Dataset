This important case—all the more relevant in the wake of this week's disclosures—was triggered after Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), a member of the Senate intelligence committee, started crying foul in 2011 about US government snooping. As a member of the intelligence committee, he had learned about domestic surveillance activity affecting American citizens that he believed was improper. He and Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.), another intelligence committee member, raised only vague warnings about this data collection, because they could not reveal the details of the classified program that concerned them. But in July 2012, Wyden was able to get the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to declassify two statements that he wanted to issue publicly. They were:</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1370690328387</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 07:18:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370692620186-6</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 Sucks</Title><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1370659873149</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 22:51:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Try google sucks About 318,000,000 results (0.18 seconds) google wins</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1370692620186</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 07:57:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370695267069-7</Id><Title>The there is no apps cannot be used anymore</Title><Msg>Everything including Domino's, official Adobe Reader, Tmblr. There are a lot now. I mean a whole lot. It was almost better before. If you work, have things to do you can never go through them all now. I also notice that a few of the Nokia fan sites have paid apps on there now. Still hold a grudge because a long time ago when I posted a new product from Nokia and the guy from one of those sites identified himself and asked how it is possible to search for that. I told him and he posted it on his site with 2 minutes and since then he posts every listing on his site. The governments website for that search slowed to the pace of a crawl the first week he posted that. So apparently millions picked up the searches. The gov. must of updated their server since then. However, I have noticed repeated rumors that are way off and appear to cause earnings and product announcement disappointment's from one and actually all because they now copy each other. If someone is short I do not know. I know he is reading this. The EOS, Catwalk etc were rumored wrong for at least since Oct. 2012 or 2011 I have lost count. It does not matter if they eventually come out if you had it wrong for a half dozen product unveils etc. CNBC hosts read this site. Cramer reads this site. I spent time with professional analysts and traders that had the boards open all day. So these blogs should probably be more responsible and now there are paid apps so you can see a mobile version. The pro analyst and writers are putting stories together based on everything they can dig up. These posts show up in search engines you know. The blogs show higher than the actual Nokia Facebook page or it's own website.

If people think that this ‘scandal’ can’t get any worse, it will, hour by hour, day by day. This has the ability to bring down our national leadership, the administration and other senior elected officials working in collusion with this administration, both Republican and Democrats. People within the NSA, the Department of Justice, and others, they know who they are, need to come forth with the documentation of ‘policy and practice’ in their possession, disclose what they know, fight what’s going on, and just do their job. I have never seen anything like this, ever. The present administration is going after leakers, media sources, anyone and everyone who is even suspected of ‘betrayal.’ That’s what they call it, ‘betrayal.’ Can you believe the size of their cahones? This administration considers anyone telling the truth about Benghazi, the IRS, hell, you name the issue, ‘betrayal,’” he said. “We know all this already,” I stated. He looked at me, giving me a look like I’ve never seen, and actually pushed his finger into my chest. “You don’t know jack,” he said, “this is bigger than you can imagine, bigger than anyone can imagine. This administration is collecting names of sources, whistle blowers and their families, names of media sources and everybody they talk to and have talked to, and they already have a huge list. If you’re not working for MSNBC or CNN, you’re probably on that list. If you are a website owner with a brisk readership and a conservative bent, you’re on that list. It’s a political dissident list, not an enemy threat list,” he stated. “What’s that exactly mean, being on that list, that is,” I asked, trying to make sense of it all. “It means that there will be censorship under the color of authority of anyone in the U.S. who is attempting to expose what’s going on in our name. It’s about controlling any damning information from reaching epidemic proportions. It’s damage control to the extreme. It’s about the upcoming censorship of the internet in the name of national security. The plans are already in place. These latest reports about ‘spying eyes’ have turned this administration and others connected to it into something very, very dangerous. They feel cornered and threatened, and I’m hearing about some plans they have to shut down the flow of information that is implicating them of wrongdoing. Time is short,” he stated. “How are they going to do this? How is it even possible” I asked. “First, they intend to use the Justice Department to silence journalists like in the Rosen case, but they won’t stop there. They will use a host of national security policies, laws, letters, whatever to take out the bigger threats,” he stated.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1370701803457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 10:30:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370703323062-17</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Now Making Almost As Much as Google When Every Android Phone Sells</Title><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1370564249210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-06 20:17:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Shorts are becoming hysterical.

I have to go there on business sometimes. I do not work there or know anything about the scandal. It is not just there to monitor computer records. They monitor every single form of communication there is in the public airwaves. The words people use signal further examination. Every form of communication cannot be monitored and the whole scandal is ridiculous. If you are doing some things wrong, they may look at whatever form of communication you made. Other than that to think they are reading your facebook messages is insane. There are not enough people working there to do that for every person in the world. They are really secret and it is a pain to go in or even to the offsite high tech blds. not on the campus or even Ft. Meade. I think people are going to give Obama a lot of grey hair, because the scandals are falling fast. This is a non event in real life. Google asked the NSA to find holes in their system maybe in 2007. I do not remember. They had so many malware attacks they had to go to the NSA. What happened is not public, but the rumor is they backed out after getting a taste of the US Gov. The NSA took an Android phone and ~worked it~ and made it safe for them to use themselves. It is not an Android like the public uses but they were able to make them safe for their own use. Now Google denies any knowledge. What is up with that statement. Will Microsoft surface in this scandal? Well investors should hope so. The NSA or US Gov. pays well really well for use of servers. Investors should hope so as they are a good client. If you think your data going over the internet is yours that is the mistake. They are public airwaves and the data in Facebook has to go through somewhere. Man some of the places down in Northern VA would surprise you. WorldCom then MCI, etc then everyone started moving in. There are a few in Annapolis MD too that I have seen some special parking for law enforcement only or something like that in data centers.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1370708046300</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 12:14:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370708661247-19</Id><Topic><Title>From a DHS insider: It's about to get ugly</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1370701803457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 10:30:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are massive server farms in Urah which are data mining everything!</Msg><Username>captain_cazo_schettino.the_brave</Username><Timestamp>1370708661247</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 12:24:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370708713819-20</Id><Title>Welcome to the Large Black Hog Association!</Title><Msg>The Large Black Hog Association (LBHA) is the premier registry and support association for Large Black hogs in the United States.

PRISM is a metaphor to take "noise" (or white light, white noise, white data) and segment it into distinct data sources. They don't need access to M$FT servers (which are probably buggy and full of viruses anymore). They just need the hash keys from Google / M$FT / Apple, etc. for ENCRYPTED communications. For your emails, they just grab the IP addresses and content. If this is correct, the Obama Administration has access to EVERY piece of data going over public networks. The Congress is probably being watched, the Supreme Court, the media, and we the people.

With a real leader we could balance the budget in three years and barely feel it.

They will not be Apple versus Microsoft, or Microsoft versus Google, etc. They will be struggles between different versions of Linux.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1370740962857</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 21:22:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370744325412-62</Id><Topic><Title>A Lot Of People Are Freaking Out Because They Think Microsoft's New Xbox Is Going To Spy On Them</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1370646007639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 19:00:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the only people who talk like you are MS employees reciting talking points they learned at MGS......shoe fit?</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1370744325412</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 22:18:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370744815982-63</Id><Topic><Title>A Lot Of People Are Freaking Out Because They Think Microsoft's New Xbox Is Going To Spy On Them</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1370646007639</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-07 19:00:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He is correct. It is possible to modify a legitimate app in open source with malicious code and still have the program run. That is how they screw u. Microsoft Vis. Studio 12 or Blend are your choices for Windows store apps and you can try as you want and you end up with programs that will never build on your own machine if you try to insert evilware. It is hard enough just getting things to run using the things they allow. At least there are some rules. Open source is the wild wild west. There is a major difference in security with Windows phone apps. I know that sounds unbelievable but it is true. You have to actually write the apps to know the difference but their is a major difference.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1370744815982</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 22:26:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370746837997-64</Id><Topic><Title>This New Rival Is Coming for Apple and Google</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1370740962857</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 21:22:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"different versions of Linux" You a real comedian, boy.</Msg><Username>the_original_al_coholic_2005</Username><Timestamp>1370746837997</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-08 23:00:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
