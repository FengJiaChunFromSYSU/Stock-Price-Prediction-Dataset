According to NPD analyst Richard Shim, the Surface Mini is expected to pack a 7.5in, 1400x1050 display, yielding up 233ppi. That would put it above the 7in competition for pixel density. Although if the rumours of an early 2014 release date are true the Surface Mini's display may yet be out-performed by that of the Apple iPad Mini 2. Meanwhile, The Verge's sources reckon that the new Surface slates will come packing Intel's latest Haswell chips. Expect a starting price of US$400 (£260) when the new line of Surfaces, um, surface.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367838364414</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 07:06:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367838976579-11</Id><Title>ACLU Asks Government to Investigate Phone Carriers Over Android Security Threat....</Title><Msg>A complaint filed with the Federal Trade Commission accuses wireless phone carriers of leaving millions of Android phone users vulnerable to attack from hackers by failing to distribute fixes for known security flaws in a timely manner.

Trading a just 11x next years earnings is a bargain. S&amp;P multiple is much higher. I bought at 26.5 early this year and everyone said it was dead and don't buy. I can't fix stupid, if you want to buy more expensive then go ahead. I said buy then and I say still buy on any weakness. Don't let go of your shares for less then 40. When it hits 40 then everyone will say it is time to buy. MSFT has big initiatives going that will power earning. People are stupidly fixated on the PC market which is only part of their business. This is to panic investors. MSFT has big growth coming from these areas: 1. Corporate spending will increase as economy will recover. Server technologies and Productivity software will grow big time. 2. Cloud. MSFT is coming along in cloud in a big way. Bing is doing well 3.Gaming - New Xbox console coming. Xbox sales are getting much bigger part of their sales. 4. Mobile devices- WP 8 is doing very well. Growing much faster then the market. They will own half the market 2-3 years out. PC market is not dead although is will grow more slowly but will still be a good revenue stream for years to come.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1367844890445</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 08:54:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367844945557-24</Id><Topic><Title>Americans Most Upbeat in Five Years as Firings Slow: Economy - THANKS OBAMA</Title><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1367520434173</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 14:47:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You obviously have blinders on just the news media that is in love with the nonesense, funny thing is a lot of them are waking up now five years later.</Msg><Username>chinookcook2000</Username><Timestamp>1367844945557</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 08:55:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367845465173-25</Id><Title>Last jobs "growth" report admittedly not enough to stay even with population</Title><Msg>but people are conditioned to failure now so even less of a failure "than expected" creates excitement for some moes.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367845465173</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:04:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367845641904-26</Id><Topic><Title>ACLU Asks Government to Investigate Phone Carriers Over Android Security Threat....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367838976579</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 07:16:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's true that Linux was designed to be hacked and is the main cause of identity theft and android is a off shoot of Linux and since anybody can change the source code it 's easily hacked.

Microsoft and its advocates feel compelled to lie about the specific way such software is free, because the truth is dangerous to them.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367847363602</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:36:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367847582304-34</Id><Topic><Title>Last jobs "growth" report admittedly not enough to stay even with population</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367845465173</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:04:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Have you considered you are a loser broom pusher because you deny reality?

Amazon briefly had a page up this weekend for an 8-inch Windows 8 tablet made by Acer. The page has since been removed, but PCWorld managed to snag a few screenshots. According to the Amazon listing, the Acer tablet will be priced at $380 and run the full version of Windows 8, meaning you can run older Windows 7 apps too. Today, most cheaper Windows tablets are still around 10 inches and run a version called RT, which can only run Windows 8 apps and work on devices with low-power mobile processors like the ones used in the iPad. It's also the first glimpse we have at what should be a whole slew of smaller and cheaper Windows 8 tablets launching in the second half of the year. Lately, consumers have been gravitating toward such devices, as evidenced by the surge in iPad sales since Apple released the iPad Mini. There are also reports and rumors that Microsoft will make its own mini version of its Surface tablet, and could announce the device as early as this summer.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367849219349</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:06:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367849357253-40</Id><Topic><Title>Here's The World's First Small And Cheap Windows 8 Tablet (Source PCWorld)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367849219349</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:06:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow- Windows Pro from Acer with an 8 inch screen- take that I turds and droid turds</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367849357253</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:09:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367849642621-41</Id><Title>So, Now the "Mainstream" Media Interested in the Horrific Benghazi Coverup All of a Sudden?</Title><Msg>Though nothing will ultimately be done by this incompetent CYA administration, the fecal matter is hitting the fan now, and the media stooges that gave it zero coverage are now jumping in to get the big story.

However with Windows Phone starting to gain a bit of traction thanks to its updated hardware and software improvements, is Windows Phone making the type of inroads that Microsoft is hoping for? Speaking to Reuters at the Microsoft campus last week, Terry Myerson of Microsoft revealed that while they might not have a huge market share in the US, there are apparently other regions in the world in which they are enjoying success. Myerson revealed that regions such as Mexico and Poland were some of the places where the Windows Phone platform is enjoying as much as 20% of the market, especially since it would seem that in those reasons, the cost of the phone minus the operator subsidies were a little more transparent that what is being offered in the US, which we guess could imply greater customer confidence and trust. Unsurprisingly, it seems that Nokia is receiving a lot of Microsoft’s attention at the moment as Myerson also revealed that “they are receiving all of our go-to-market energy right now.”</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367849838167</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:17:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367849876080-44</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro in June Consumer Reports issue top of the list</Title><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1367812430598</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-05 23:53:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>9 OUT OF 10 the mobile devices in Consumer Reports are loaded with W!N8.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1367849876080</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:17:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367849888388-45</Id><Title>Cautious trading this AM on MSFT....</Title><Msg>YOU see folks the shorts are getting nervous as they have been beaten almost every day since our earnings release as last week they dumped 5 million shares each day at the opening minutes...

Slander likewise denotes false statements that damage a person’s reputation, but it is committed orally or in any other transient form. Both words have complex legal definitions and connotations, which we won’t explore here. Legal complications aside, all you need to remember is that libel is written and slander is spoken. Slander is also often used informally as a synonym of defamation.

Russian nuclear-capable bombers flew within the U.S. defense zone close to Alaska last week in Putin's latest chest-puffing, nuclear saber rattling against the U.S. It was the fifth incident of Russian strategic bombers flying against the United States since June - simulating strikes by flying near Alaska, the California coast, our bases at Guam and Japan. They are aggressively trying to pressure Obama to officially write off any plans for missile defense for U.S. allied countries in the region that Russia would like to have for their own. He is happily going along with the thugs, incredibly abandoning in 2009 American promises of cooperation with Poland and the Czech Republic. It is important to remember Obama's open-mic surrender on missile defense to the screw-turning Medvedev last year, which like Benghazi got scant mention in the "mainstream" press: President Obama: "This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." President Medvedev: "I understand. I will transmit this information to Vladimir." I wonder when Komrade Obama will be making the announcement? Vlady and the boys are going to start taking his lunch money pretty soon if he doesn't comply.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1367858981811</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 12:49:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367859269489-77</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts: Resistance is futile....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367858831100</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 12:47:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep, more buying money around than shorts money</Msg><Username>nw_ripper</Username><Timestamp>1367859269489</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 12:54:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367859509830-78</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts: Never go against Dr. Osso....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367516627152</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 13:43:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here we go....</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367859509830</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 12:58:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367859790474-79</Id><Topic><Title>IF MSFT shorts want to make money, you must go long....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367353442009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 16:24:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another gentle reminder....</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367859790474</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:03:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367860267138-80</Id><Title>Birinyi ‘guidance’ for S&amp;P 500 index now 1,900 by end of year....</Title><Msg>A 1,900 S&amp;P 500 Index SPX +0.21% by the end of the year? That’s not a 6 that got spun around by mistake, and it’s not quite a target, it’s more like a guidance, according to Birinyi Associates in a recent note. “It will be reported that this is now our forecast. We would rather think of this, as corporations do, as guidance,” the note, authored by Laszlo Birinyi and Jeffrey Yale Rubin, said. “Our approaches and analysis continue to point toward higher prices. In addition to the historical parallels, we still view sentiment as subdued and nowhere approaching extremes.” Now that the index has surpassed the firm’s 1,600 target, Birinyi is comparing the current bull market to those from 1982 and 1990. If this run parallels those, we might just be looking at a 1,900 S&amp;P 500 by the end of the year.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367860267138</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:11:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367860817074-81</Id><Title>Its coming - Smart glasses by Vuzi will eventually replace cells - breaking out - last chance to buy cheap</Title><Msg>Tech is already here and being implemented</Msg><Username>whattime0000</Username><Timestamp>1367860817074</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 13:20:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367861758600-82</Id><Title>Obama apologizing yet again for America causing problems in Mexico</Title><Msg>"The root cause of much of the violence in Mexico is the demand for illegal drugs" While he is at it, why doesn't he apologize for the fact that much of the demand for illegal drugs is from his supporters.

These are the two forces responsible for the movement of every single stock that is traded on an open market. LOL...not manipulation....Believe it or not, there’s a difference between being right and making money. On the topic of Volume!!!!.... Volume is an important indicator in technical analysis as it is used to measure the worth of a market move. If the markets have made strong price move either up or down the perceived strength of that move depends on the volume for that period. The higher the volume during that price move the more significant the move. When you have decreased volume pushing prices higher (or lower) the message here is "usually" that there is little support for the current price movement, and the trend has a low likelihood of continuing.For our example above the stock is trading higher on low volume. This may be a sign of uncertainty and the gains may be short lived. Without the conformation of volume it's very difficult to be sure of any price move or new trend.

Let me ask you this, when there is no volume on the demand side I would trust you would agree that a large sell "at market" could quickly drop the price, what would that do to supply if the price dropped 10% in a low demand market. The bot controlled market moves on price, if the price dropped rapidly the supply would increase not decrease. Supply and demand has little to do with this market in the short term, to be sure it will rule in the longer term and there has been weak demand for 3000 DOW points.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367867904552</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:18:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367868298013-98</Id><Topic><Title>Supply and demand...</Title><Username>jbspectrum</Username><Timestamp>1367867505595</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:11:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sure, sure everybody know that. but real story is: no mm or hedgie have as much power over stock price as truffle-spewing dog nipple trading pattern. that always signal of infinite upside! unless dog laying on back ...</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367868298013</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:24:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367868478219-99</Id><Title>Windoze Phone is a total threat to the Iturds and droid turds</Title><Msg>aint that right phands HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR AHR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR HAR</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367868478219</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:27:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367868637490-100</Id><Topic><Title>Supply and demand...</Title><Username>jbspectrum</Username><Timestamp>1367867505595</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:11:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Supply and Demand is only an illusion....a false idea or belief...never the less it only exist in theory not in practice.... gl, JB.</Msg><Username>jbspectrum</Username><Timestamp>1367868637490</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:30:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367868692701-101</Id><Topic><Title>So, Now the "Mainstream" Media Interested in the Horrific Benghazi Coverup All of a Sudden?</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1367849642621</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 10:14:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>idiot Bush your darling idol did it idiot!!!!!!!!! without that idiot it would have never happened and the French and Germans wouldnt have had to abandon the US in Iraq</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367868692701</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 15:31:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367868799982-102</Id><Title>This Man Is Building Microsoft's Next Multi-Billion-Dollar Business — From Android Devices</Title><Msg>Google it...

Central Texas is booming completely in spite of Obama. Texas is hunkered down, along with many other states, taking the Obama administration to court on all fronts - Obamacare, EPA, unconstitutional gun control... That is what helps jobs in Texas. Obama has done nothing - not one thing - to spur the economic growth in Central Texas. The Campaigner in Chief is still yet to govern. But then I guess that's why none of the horrible things happening in the economy and culture stick to him. He doesn't get involved and has others to blame.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1367870989085</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 16:09:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367871143383-111</Id><Topic><Title>Joy!

So if we needed to patch, adjust or adapt, we could.” Specifically, the ISS astronauts will be using computers running Debian 6. Earlier some of the on-board computers had been using Scientific Linux, a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clone. While not the newest version of Debian, Debian 7 has just been released, Debian is nothing if not well-tested and reliable. While Linux has been used on the ISS ever since its launch (PDF link) and for NASA ground operations almost since the day Linus Torvalds created it, it hasn't seen that much use on PCs in space. “Things really clicked," said Chuala in an interview, "after we came to understand how Linux views the world, the interconnectedness of how one thing affects another. You need that worldview. I have quite a bit of Linux experience, but to see others who were really getting it, that was exciting.” In addition to appearing on in-flight laptops, Linux is also running Robonaut (R2), the first humanoid robot in space. Currently on the station and experimental mode, R2 is meant to carry out tasks too dangerous or tedious for astronauts. --------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1367883473746</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 19:37:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367883611608-145</Id><Topic><Title>Can Surface Save Microsoft?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367872649137</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 16:37:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not just a lost house by your neighbor. whole village of kokomo, texas disappear! another fertilizer accident? :-D</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367883611608</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 19:40:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367883752500-146</Id><Topic><Title>Can Surface Save Microsoft?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367872649137</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 16:37:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you sound angry. why you put that label on him? this seem a little backwards, no? maybe unplug projector and let it cool down? :-)</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367883752500</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 19:42:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367883896109-147</Id><Topic><Title>Can Surface Save Microsoft?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367872649137</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 16:37:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you think rocky agrawal hiding out on yahoo board for 8 or 10 year so he can pump video today? that really long term plan!

We are trading now about 11 times next FY's earnings and with the growth projections in mind, we can expect $4-4.50 a share of earnings and that would translate to $44-48 a share, touching $50.00.... AS you know , Mr. Market doesn't need to get the numbers first and then let the price to adjust all the time and that all this will happen in the next two quarters as we massively beat expectations and some....

"Some users are nervous about switching to a new phone and new platform because it can mean starting over without the personalized apps that you invested time to discover and download," said Tomer Kagan , CEO and co-founder of Quixey. "The Switch to Windows Phone app makes it easy to switch devices by providing a simpler way of recreating their app experience from their old Android devices onto a new Windows Phone." Switch to Windows Phone makes the task of getting app experiences from Android to Windows Phone quick and intuitive. Users simply download the Switch to Windows Phone app on their Android device, save the matched app list to the cloud service, and then download the Switch to Windows Phone app to their new Windows Phone. Through Quixey's app search technology, Switch to Windows Phone recommends the same or similar apps found on the original device which can then be downloaded from the Windows Phone Store. A separate "Featured" tab within the app also provides a personalized app discovery feature powered by Quixey. People have their favorite apps and they are important to them. Knowing the apps are available on their new phone is an important decision before switching phones. Now, with Quixey's recommendations, they can painlessly recreate their previous app experiences and discover new apps through the Featured tab. With over 135,000 Windows Phone apps, Windows Phone 8 has all the functionality users look for in a smartphone.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367891438244</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 21:50:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367892392529-169</Id><Title>We all gonna be rich - Windows 8 prepaid smartphone on sale at Walmart - $129.00 Yea buddeeey</Title><Msg>Camera Resolution2592 x 1936 pixels CMOS Sensor5.0 Megapixels Camera Digital Zoom4 x Camera Focal length28 mm Camera F-Stop/Aperturef/2.4 Camera Focus range10 cm to infinity Camera Image FormatsJPEG/Exif Camera FeaturesAuto and Manual White Balance, Continuous Auto Focus[1], Full Screen Viewfinder, Geotagging, Lenses Applications, Still Image Editor, Touch Focus Video Recording Resolution1280 x 720 pixels Video Recording Frame Rate30 fps Video Digital Zoom4 x Video Recording FormatsH.264/AVC Video FeaturesVideo Player Video Recorder Video Streaming Video Playback Formats3GPP formats (H.263), ASF, H.264/AVC, M4V, MPEG-4, VC-1, WMV 9 Video Playback Frame Rate30 fps Graphic FormatsBMP, EXIF, GIF87a, GIF89a, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, WBMP, WMF Audio FeaturesAudio Streaming Bluetooth Stereo Handsfree Speaker Music Player Uplink Noise Cancellation Audio Formats3G2, AAC, AAC LC, AMR-NB, AMR-WB, HE-AAC v1, HE-AAC v2, M4A, MP3, MP4, WMA 10 Pro, WMA 9 Speech CodecsAMR-NB AMR-WB EFR GSM FR GSM HR Notes1 In video mode.

The divvy checks are sweet. I have a feeling it's going to roll like the old days. Don't be surprised to see 2 for 1 stock splits. You look back after 10 years and you got a boatload of share no matter how many you started with. Then you look at these days it goes up nearly a dollar a day and it's like wow this sucker is paying me more than I am making doing whatever the hell you do. Yea man the 10 year Microsoft sweet spot.

Obama Hides Behind Lib Media Blackout</Title><Msg>There was a sensational expose of Abortionist Gosnell's "House of Horrors" on TV last weekend. Abortionist Gosnell is now on trial for multiple cases of infanticide in his unspeakably filthy, blood soaked abortion facility in Philadelpha. The crimes he has been indicted for are too numerous to recount and so depraved as to send a shiver through any decent person's heart. Numerous members of his "staff" have already pleaded guilty to multiple cases of infanticide and other crimes. The complicity of the governments of Pennsylvania and Philadelpia in allowing this house of horrors to exist for about 30 years is shameful beyond belief. The blackout of this case by the abortion promoting left wing media shows how it has also been depraved in its support of the abortion agenda. We need to be reminded that President Obama is a soulmate of Gosnell since he voted in support of infanticide multiple times when he was in the Illinois Senate. Now he lies about it and is hiding out behind the lib media blackout of this sensational story.</Msg><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1367893308427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 22:21:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367894288023-173</Id><Topic><Title>Bengazi - A Political Witch Hunt To Knock Down Hillary A Notch</Title><Username>punch_the_hippie</Username><Timestamp>1367880273832</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 18:44:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" A Political Witch Hunt To Knock Down Hillary A Notch" I think we found the witch, the hunt is ending.
