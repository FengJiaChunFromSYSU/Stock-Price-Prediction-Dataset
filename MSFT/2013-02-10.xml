I didn't read all of the rant, but I think I read enough to say that I agree with him completely about Perl. I used Perl with some enthusiasm for a time, but will never use it again if I can avoid it. It's just an ugly language. "There's more than one way to do it," is its curse; there are far too many ways to do anything. I also agree to some extent about Lisp. Lisp, despite its antiquity, is still in some sense the most important programming language there is (but not in the sense of being popular). But there are too many quirky implementations of it in the wild. Its antiquity shows in the names of a couple of VERY important functions, "car" and "cdr". Incredibly, the "ar" and "dr" suffixes refer to hardware registers in a long-defunct computing system. I once wrote a partial re-implementation of Lisp in C, and for those functions I used the the names "hd" and "tl", short for "head" and "tail", which make far more sense. One author I read claimed that "Python is Lisp", which in some metaphorical sense is probably true. Also it is said that, despite its C-like syntax, Javascript is much more like Lisp in its internal workings, so that a Lisp interpreter written in Javascript is not a particularly unnatural thing to do. So, even if Lisp itself were to die out (not gonna happen) its legacy lives on in other, more popular languages.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1360492705678</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 05:38:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360493189847-19</Id><Title>MS Office over a BILLION users</Title><Msg>Microsoft’s Office Has over One Billion Users and over 1.3 billion Windows users around the world.

In a blog posting earlier today, the company didn't report how many units of the new Surface Pro it had sold, or even had shipped to stores, and was even careful not to imply that the "amazing" customer response was actually being reflected in any specific way, such as in indirect sales or even a quantified numbers of customers. Instead, Microsoft's Panos Panay stated that the company is "working with our retail partners who are currently out of stock of the 128GB Surface Pro to replenish supplies as quickly as possible." However, nearly all of the readers commenting on the blog posting noted frustrating launch day experiences that included observations such as, "the Best Buy employee told us they only had a single Surface Pro for sale and it was the 64 GB version," and "most stores received only a couple of units. My local Staples got 1 unit (64 GB), Best Buy got 7 (4 64 GB, 3 128GB) all available only to the folks who reserved one. I was the first in line today at BBY and didn't get anything. This is a complete disappointment and failure.

The fact that the low end model of the Surface RT sold out “suggests that buyers of the RT device were price-sensitive and were looking for something with a tablet-like price,” Bott answered. “By contrast, the initial sell-out of the higher-priced 128 GB Surface Pro suggests early buyers are spec-sensitive and are skeptical of the available storage in the 64 GB device.” This all happened before Reports of inventory "sell outs" is not new, and certainly not for Microsoft. In 2009, the firm's Zune HD music player was widely reported to have “sold out” from resellers ranging from Amazon to Newegg to BestBuy. Two years later it was discontinued because in reality it had never sold very well.</Msg><Username>fan_tazer</Username><Timestamp>1360522429839</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 13:53:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360526569860-49</Id><Title>"Most of the inflammtory quotations right wing nutjobs attribute to me are totally made up."</Title><Msg>--Thomas Jefferson "That Sally Hemmings is the best thing my wife left me in her will." --idem.</Msg><Username>nd1005</Username><Timestamp>1360526569860</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 15:02:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360526896934-50</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro is an Amazing Device</Title><Username>jjking516</Username><Timestamp>1360519143715</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 12:59:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Surface is #$%$.

Bought Saturday at 9:45am at the San Juan, Puerto Rico Microsoft Store in Plaza. The rep told me they had already sold over 60 since they opened at 9. Many had called beforehand (like myself). Waited a LONG time for this tablet/PC to finally arrive. I am putting in on-sale in November to buy the Pro v.2 with the new Intel processor (thinner, lighter, better lasting battery) and a 256gb mSata disk. Microsoft should have released this back in October or November. Don't know why they had to wait.</Msg><Username>keys.ascension</Username><Timestamp>1360545201046</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:13:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360546832014-75</Id><Topic><Title>Real jobs created in private sector with technology developed before Obama</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1360544881881</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-10 20:08:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Finish that bottle already. Under Pres Obama Federal oil land is being released to companies that will extract the oil. Unfortunatey you fail, all the time, to express the whole story, or what's known as, the truth.. For some reason you like to pick at statements, then make up stories from a few chosen words.
