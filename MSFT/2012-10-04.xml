Romney has one way vision, he doesn't understand middle class except they wait his tables. You don't get it either. Romney lies to you and you lap the vomit right up. You like paying for billionaire's perks? If you do then you are for romny.

The frequency with which Romney creates international incidents is more than slightly suggestive of his unfitness to serve as president. And his proclivity for such gaffes begs for a new word to describe his imploding diplomacy, which I am calling “Implomacy.” This time Romney was attempting to praise Israel as a prosperous and productive nation, but in his inimitably derisive manner, Romney approached the subject from a direction that portrayed Palestinians as inferior culturally. Romney: Culture makes all the difference. [...] As you come here and you see the GDP per capita, for instance, in Israel which is about $21,000 dollars, and compare that with the GDP per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian authority, which is more like $10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality. [...] And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things. Let’s set aside for the moment that Romney badly misstated the economic facts. According to the World Bank, in 2011 Israel’s GDP was $31,000 per capita, compared to just over $1,500 in the West Bank and Gaza. But the bigger problem with Romney’s remarks is that they are an affront to people who do not have control over their economy. Israel enforces severe restrictions on the territories inhabited by Palestinians. Granted, they may have good cause considering the threat of attacks that have originated from those territories, but the resultant economic conditions can hardly be attributed to any cultural shortcomings on the part of the Palestinian people. The inappropriateness of Romney’s comments are evident if you take the same comments and replace the names of those involved. For instance… As you come here and you see the median household income, for instance, in Beverly Hills which is about $96,000 dollars, and compare that with the median income just across town in Watts, which is more like $25,000, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality. [...] And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things. Would Romney suggest that the residents of Watts are culturally inferior? Or Harlem? Or Mississippi? Does he notice a “dramatically stark difference” in the vitality of residents of Greenwich, CT, as compared to those in West Virginia? If Romney were to have said something along these lines he would have certainly forfeited the votes of those communities. The problem with his doing it in Israel is that, were he president, he could fatally harm the efforts to bring the region to a negotiated peace. As it stands now, how willing do you think the Palestinians would be to trust Romney to be a fair dealer in future peace talks? This is not a trivial political dust-up. Lives hang in the balance. And Romney is proving that his hamfisted boorishness is too dangerous to take a chance on. He continues to make us wonder who means by “us.”</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1349371913128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:31:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349372015840-60</Id><Title>President poverty</Title><Msg>We have a real problem here, in that because Obummer is the first affirmative-action-president, and he knows that because he's a nice looking, cool-black-dude he can get away with just about anything, including telling direct lies.

In his Forbes (10/4) column Ken Silverstein writes that the Keystone XL pipeline won't go through until after the presidential election next month, because Mitt Romney has voiced support for the project, but isn't yet president. And, if President Obama right now attempts to push through the pipeline, "he would risk alienating an important part of his base just weeks before the election." Silverstein says Obama will approve the pipeline if he gets re-elected, because it will no longer be politically risky to do so. However, he accuses Obama of "coming across as being a weak lapdog of the environmental movement - placing his desire to be president ahead of creating new jobs."</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1349382719891</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 16:31:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349383109220-74</Id><Title>Democrats vs Republicans</Title><Msg>If a Republican is down-and-out, he thinks about how to better his situation.

October 4, 2012 | 6:58 pm 133Comments Paul Bedard Washington Secrets The Washington Examiner Photo - President Obama reelection campaign, rattled by his Wednesday night debate performance, could be in for even worse news. According to knowlegable sources, a national magazine and a national web site are preparing a blockbuster donor scandal story. Sources told Secrets that the Obama campaign has been trying to block the story. But a key source said it plans to publish the story Friday or, more likely, Monday. According to the sources, a taxpayer watchdog group conducted a nine-month investigation into presidential and congressional fundraising and has uncovered thousands of cases of credit card solicitations and donations to Obama and Capitol Hill, allegedly from unsecure accounts, and many from overseas. That might be a violation of federal election laws. The Obama campaign has received hundreds of millions in small dollar donations, many via credit card donations through their website. On Thursday, the campaign announced a record September donor haul of $150 million. At the end of the 2008 presidential campaign, the Obama-Biden effort was hit with a similar scandal. At the time, the Washington Post reported that the Obama campaign let donors use "largely untraceable prepaid credit cards that could potentially be used to evade limits on how much an individual is legally allowed to give or to mask a contributor's identity."</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349400181916</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 21:23:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349400245021-102</Id><Topic><Title>Obadidos, please dont subcum to the policy of screwing up the board as liberals have done</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1349393307962</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 19:28:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have got get into garbage to get rid of it!

Now he lies about it and his left wing media stooges (such as Yahoo) protect him. Make no mistake, Obama is right out there at the furthest reaches of left wing extremism, swinging a wrecking ball at our culture and our civilization. No civilized person could vote for this ghoul.
