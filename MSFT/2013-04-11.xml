That's dumb because good computers often cost $1000 and the iPad is a device that uses the mobile web system rather than the regular web. In fact I like the 2.6 pound 13.3" Samsung Series 9 at about $1200. But if insisting on the low price point then that aims the future PC towards the Intel Atom processor. In fact the quad-core Atom processor is due out before the holiday season. But also, there is an expected PC push using the Haswell processor and that one just out. Basically, the PC buyer is waiting for the correct form factor to develop and waiting for Intel to catch up to low power consumption.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1365654397921</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 00:26:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365655332518-2</Id><Title>One gets the feeling that Balmer's subconscience wants to destroy the company</Title><Msg>I just looked at the Surface Pro at the local Best Buy.

But if my quad-core Atom prediction is right, then those PC's will be a big market. A PC is IA. That's Intel-Architecture. A computer that is ARM-Architecture should be called something else.

Inasmuch as there are now other venues for doing this i.e., tablets and phones, the need for PCs is decreasing. This is supported in part by the losses to the laptop market which far surpass those of desktop PCs. The positive is that this will subside. At some point in the near future, those migrating from "PC driven internet surfing" to tablet derived surfing will begin to subside and comparables will once again improve; albeit absolute numbers are unlikely to return to prior levels. In a nut shell, we are looking at a transition of a subpopulation of users. That percentage will normalize going forward. The PC is here to stay. There are few that can do work on tablets unless they are modified with external keyboards etc....that mimic PCs. In the end, those people will gravitate to tablets with Windows operating systems if they wish to integrate with what they have at home and in their offices. So in the end, it will not matter what the device, it will matter only the operating system.</Msg><Username>zing21042</Username><Timestamp>1365683651252</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 08:34:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365683795829-25</Id><Title>In all my life I have never seen Microsoft stock price very high and they owned 90% of the PC market OS.</Title><Msg>WHY THEN does apple and all the rest reach heights of 500 to 800 dollars a share?

Quoting: 'In November 2012, CEO Steve Ballmer proclaimed that Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) is no longer just a software company that licensed its operating system to PC makers to use as they pleased. Instead, Microsoft is now a devices and services company that develops its own end-to-end experience for consumers. Ballmer said Microsoft wants to maintain firm control over how its products are used. 'Microsoft provided the first glimpse of how that plan might come together two weeks ago, when it unveiled its new strategy codenamed "Blue." The company promises to roll out more frequent and more incremental updates of Windows, Windows Phone, Office and Xbox software. More than that, those updates will be coordinated across Microsoft's multiple platforms, to get all customers' "devices, apps and services working together." 'Instead of a mishmash of systems out there using outdated Microsoft software with glaring compatibility issues, "Blue" could ensure that Microsoft's own products evolve at the same rate as the rest of the tech world. 'If this is starting to sounds a lot like how Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) and Google (GOOG, Fortune 500) do business, that's intentional.' ___________________________________ Well, okay, if "me, too" is a vision, then Microsoft has a vision.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365693106487</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 11:11:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365693505718-95</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8</Title><Username>jonfine399</Username><Timestamp>1365692972891</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 11:09:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sonney give it back to the sales rep who is showing it to you- when you grow up you can have one too</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1365693505718</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 11:18:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365693541512-96</Id><Topic><Title>MICROSOFT DOWNGRADED TARGET $5 CASH LEVELS PC IS DEAD WIN8 STINKS</Title><Username>nasdaqczar2</Username><Timestamp>1365691179765</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 10:39:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>single digits coming downgraded to sell this is bad</Msg><Username>glaxobioone</Username><Timestamp>1365693541512</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 11:19:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365693749530-97</Id><Topic><Title>Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) going LINUX ... saves lots of money</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1365690781505</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 10:33:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And I'd bet good money that father_zosima just proved once again that he doesn't know what a stock exchange is...</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365693749530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 11:22:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365693994189-98</Id><Topic><Title>Will Microsoft Bounce?</Title><Username>wanda.avila</Username><Timestamp>1361975704544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:35:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting report!</Msg><Username>tommyunknow</Username><Timestamp>1365693994189</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 11:26:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365694035978-99</Id><Topic><Title>Steve Ballmer must go</Title><Username>bobbleaque</Username><Timestamp>1365690090932</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 10:21:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't think that is what is holding it up.

OS X (Lion) is a very nice system with features not on Windows 7. But the issue of printers underlines the true difference. Lion sees the printers on the network and automatically loads the drivers. Windows 7 sees nothing. It took a Bangalore MSFT technician an hour to load the software. I had to hunt down the IP addresses for the printers. MSFT does not get it.

Quoting: 'Shares of software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) are getting hammered today, down by 5% at the low. PC partner Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ ) is seeing its shares crushed even more, with losses having flirted with 8%. Chipzilla Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) didn't escape the beating, with its shares having lost more than 3% before recovering moderately. 'The big news today is that the PC market just posted the biggest drop in nearly two decades, according to IDC's latest estimates. Worldwide PC units fell by 14% in the first quarter, much worse than the 7.7% decline IDC had previously braced itself for. Further, IDC's 7.7% prediction had already been reduced, so no one was prepared for the enormous dropoff. 'Windows 8 has done the PC market no favors. In fact, IDC says Microsoft's new operating system platform slowed the market, as consumers aren't too impressed by the radical interface changes that Microsoft is pursuing. Windows 8 is a bold new vision, but it would seem that it's too bold for the average user.' _____________________________ Well, Windows 8 is a big change, I wouldn't call it a "bold new vision". For years the big selling point of Windows has been that it's what people are accustomed to. So a big change is not a selling point for it.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365699098137</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 12:51:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365699105483-151</Id><Title>Ballmer Needs To Go!

Chrome books are starting to fly off the shelves because Win 8 stinks. You can live in disbelief but I bought a bunch of long range puts and will make a load of money when the numbers come out. I also hate what they are going to try to do to the Xbox, that will be a flop as well.

Michael Bonfigli/The Christian Science Monitor The federal Treasury expects to collect a record $2.712 trillion in taxes on Americans and U.S. business this year, shattering the 2007 high of $2.5 trillion in taxes. Despite the sputtering economy and sustained high unemployment, the fine print in President Obama's budget belatedly presented Wednesday revealed that the administration expects to take more in taxes than the Congressional Budget Office projects. CBO put the 2013 estimate at $2.708 trillion. Republicans have seized on the number to bolster their fight against Obama's goal of raising taxes, especially on the wealthy. "We are projecting to see revenues double over the next decade. I think this year will be the highest revenue number ever in the history of the country. I think we have enough revenue in Washington," said Rep. Dave Camp, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax law.

They do not account for every sale you know. They use polling methods that are often challenged in court. You can do the same in small claims court. It will cost you under $50.00 to file, no lawyer needed and it will only take several hours in court. The basis will be that there methods have been proven to be not 100% accurate and they do not inform consumers of this when releasing polling numbers. That is all you need. Also, Goldman Sachs can be sued using the same method except using a different basis. You would have to have a clerk assist you in getting their records of positions in Microsoft for up to 14 before and after. The 3 day trading window only applies for SEC. For civil matters it is up to a Judge and how he personally feels. Look and see if they had a short position prior to the announcement. See if they buy the stock after it has been knocked down. They do this every time it rises. So anytime the stock goes up on it's own, they want to protect their short position. Judges know this. If you have lost more than $500.00 since yesterday it would be beneficial to do so. Any analyst, writer or commentator can be sued the same way. The judge either says yes or no, it is easy either way. CNBC are liable as well.</Msg><Username>msftstockmachine</Username><Timestamp>1365707531392</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:12:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365707637999-217</Id><Title>LOok for new lows from low pc sales HPQ MSFT INTC and on and on</Title><Msg>Yep we are so over priced here on just games anyway.

IE 10 introduced new security features that take the control away from the user. Microsoft has shot itself in the foot and needs to restore much of what was best about their operating system.

A Fun Story: Windows 8 Engineer Has Good Idea There are three engineers in a car; an electrical engineer, a chemical engineer and a Microsoft engineer. Suddenly the car just stops by the side of the road, and the three engineers look at each other wondering what could be wrong. The electrical engineer suggests stripping down the electronics of the car and trying to trace where a fault might have occurred. The chemical engineer, not knowing much about cars, suggests that maybe the fuel is becoming emulsified and getting blocked somewhere. Then, the Microsoft engineer, not knowing much about anything, comes up with a suggestion, 'Why don't we close all the windows, get out, get back in, open the windows again, and maybe it'll work.' .................................................................................</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365716467066</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 17:41:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365716473108-298</Id><Topic><Title>Will Microsoft Bounce?</Title><Username>wanda.avila</Username><Timestamp>1361975704544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:35:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh feces!

Searches on Bing returned five times more links to malicious websites than Google searches, according to an 18-month study from German independent testing lab AV-Test. Though search engines have worked to suppress malicious results, the study concluded that malware infested websites still appear in their top results. The study looked at nearly 40 million websites provided by seven different search engines. About 10 million results came from Bing and another 10 million from Google. 13 million sites were provided by the Russian service Yandex, with the rest coming from Blekko, Faroo, Teoma and Baidu respectively. Of these 40 million sites, AV-Test found 5,000 pieces of malware—and admittedly small percentage of websites. Google the Safest The study concluded that while all the search engines the lab evaluated delivered malware, Google delivered the least. It was followed by Bing, which returned a disconcerting five times as much malware as Google. Yandex, the Russian website, delivered 10 times as many malicious sites. Thankfully, the 5,000 pieces of malware the study found are concentrated in Yandex results—which had 3,330 malicious links out of the 13 million the AV-Test looked at. Bing had a little under half that, with 1,285 malicious results out of 10 million pages. Google returned a mere 272 malicious results in 10 million while Bleko had even fewer: 203 out of around three million. ------------------------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365717907850</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 18:05:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365718114886-303</Id><Topic><Title>Will Microsoft Bounce?</Title><Username>wanda.avila</Username><Timestamp>1361975704544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:35:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very helpful.</Msg><Username>fordjohn842</Username><Timestamp>1365718114886</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 18:08:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365718148692-304</Id><Topic><Title>Windoze 8 Jokes</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365716467066</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 17:41:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow 25 minutes and you haven't been flamed by 100 MS fanboz yet????

The big banks and others on wall street have shown they are fully capable of flat out deception and chicanery and I would guess not much has changed. Ambition and hard work are good; excessive greed isn't.</Msg><Username>jscilla</Username><Timestamp>1365720960891</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 18:56:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365721453433-318</Id><Topic><Title>Win8 way ahead compared to iOS and Android</Title><Username>sjais0307</Username><Timestamp>1365720868329</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 18:54:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, yeah, yeah.....windoze 8 sucks butt crevices...it is a horrible travesty, and isn't selling.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365721453433</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 19:04:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365721763534-319</Id><Topic><Title>Big Volume, Still a Buy?</Title><Username>hugh_dawg</Username><Timestamp>1359170136948</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:15:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing this article.</Msg><Username>ontfutselsocorro</Username><Timestamp>1365721763534</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 19:09:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365722100841-320</Id><Title>Dow Hits a Record High!</Title><Msg>But Microsoft sinks to a new Low with Windows 8.

I have heard both Steve Ballmer and Steven Sinofsky doing the Windows 8 side show and am not impressed. Sinofsky was supposed to be THE Windows 8 guru. He was sent down the road following the Windows RT fiasco. Ballmer should be the next "guru" to be sent off stage. Then hire the best advertising firm on the planet to show the real advantages and benefits of Windows 8 on a state of the art Ultrabook/Tablet. Bring in Don Draper and the boys over at Weiden + Kennedy to present a serious and proper ad campaign. The sad part is that all the previous attempts have given such a "lame" impression of both the Surface and Windows 8, that is going to take a monster effort to overcome the damage those terrible, childish commercials have created.

It took me some initial adjusting to but I like it more and more as I use it. I think MS should put the Start Button on the classic desktop with a service pack and put the red "X" back in the upper right of programs so you can close them without having to use ALT+F4. (The third party Start Button utilities seem to throw you back to the Metro or Tile screen). But overall it certainly is much better than Vista and from the classic desktop it runs business programs as well as Windows 7. It does boot up and shut down much faster than Windows 7; installs printers more easily and seems more stable than Win7. I think more people will warm up to it over time but not sure that enough will to make it successful.</Msg><Username>baronbuck</Username><Timestamp>1365734375705</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 22:39:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365734521632-332</Id><Title>Sell Apple buy Microsoft and</Title><Msg>thank me later.</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1365734521632</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 22:42:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365734604356-333</Id><Title>Love my WIN8</Title><Msg>It's faster.
