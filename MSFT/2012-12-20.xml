Nothing is farther from the truth that Obama lies, and Obama is not for the middle class. You nuts can hold onto your stubborn destructive to America behavior forever against Obama, it isn't going to change a vote for him.

"Old men over 60 don't like those kids with tattoos." FALSE! I am 62 and have children and a large number of friends that have tattoos.

I have been a stockholder for many years and Ballmer has done nothing to get the stock price up. In fact, he has made negative comments that drove the stock down more than once. As reported on the internet: "In fact, Ballmer has been selected as one of the worst CEOs of the year, but luckily for him, Andrew Mason of Groupon has managed to prove “his incompetence as a CEO” with several occasions. So why Ballmer, you may ask. It’s pretty simple, Greenberg explains. Windows 8 is yet to deliver that great performance everybody has been expecting, the company’s shares have fallen by more than 40 percent since he became CEO and Microsoft has spent quite a fortune on smaller startups that seem useless for the time being."</Msg><Username>nw_ripper</Username><Timestamp>1356046317982</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 18:31:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356050056391-48</Id><Title>A good sign, it looks like partisan politics is falling away and people are going on with their lives</Title><Msg>instead of hating.

He isn't a King you know, he can't just raise or lower tax by himself like you think. Last I checked millions is more than the 250K net income limit, so that also is a bit of a stretch to call his truth a lie.
