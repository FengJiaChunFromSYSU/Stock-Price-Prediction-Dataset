The bloody awful surface has sunk.... ================================ Is the Surface Running Scared of Apple’s iPad? By Aabha Rathee | More Articles December 25, 2012 Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad was the most popular tablet at retail stores during last week’s intense shopping period, according to R.W. Baird’s William Power. By comparison, Microsoft’s Surface (NASDAQ:MSFT) did not make a very successful start. In addition, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Kindle Fire and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab line were “frequently cited alternatives,” while the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Nexus 10 was also a strong option.

How Did all the Tablets Fare? “Microsoft’s Surface, which Best Buy just recently started carrying, was not recommended to us by reps without us asking about it specifically,” Power wrote in a note to researchers, according to Barron’s. “When asked about sales to date, reps noted that the device was new and indicated that early demand has been modest relative to the iPad and Kindle Fire.” Power added that retail executives indicated that Surface sale volumes had been modest, with the primary appeal for its Surface buyers being the tablet’s ability to run Microsoft Office. “Consistent with our Best Buy checks, the Surface was also in stock at all Staples stores we contacted,” the analyst said. ==============================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1356446242466</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 09:37:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356446371003-10</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft’s Sales Weaker Than Expected</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1356382014428</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 15:46:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From the same source.....looks like the rubbish Surface has sunk...... ================================================= Is the Surface Running Scared of Apple’s iPad?

According to IRS data, the “richest 1% paid $84 billion more in taxes in 2007 than they had in 2000,” a 23% increase. In addition, their “share of the overall income tax burden grew, climbing from 37% in 2000 to 40% in 2007.” All this occurred even though their rates went down. The IRS numbers also found the bottom half of taxpayers “paid $6 billion less in income taxes in 2007 than they had seven years earlier,” which is a 16% decrease, and “their share of the total income tax burden actually went from 3.9% to 2.9%.” Further, as Investors Business Daily noted, the Bush tax cuts also pushed millions of people off of the tax rolls entirely because Bush “doubled the per-child tax credit to $1,000 and lowered the bottom rate to 10%.”</Msg><Username>willstand99</Username><Timestamp>1356488594630</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-25 21:23:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
