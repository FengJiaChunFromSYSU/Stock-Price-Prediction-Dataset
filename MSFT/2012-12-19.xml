That means that it effectively could own a 6.67% stake in the gun maker, which filed to go public in late 2009 before pulling the offering in early 2011. In fact, the figure could be even higher since CalSTRS also committed $100 million to a $1.4 billion predecessor fund, which likely made the original investment." Maybe? Possibly due to investment into a predecessor fund? "On Tuesday, private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management announced that in response to the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., it intends to divest itself from its ownership of gunmaker Freedom Group."

We can't protect ourselves from a modern mititary, but of course that stupid crazy notion is just an excuse to play with more guns. Our protections are built into the system, elections, and the self check structure of our govenment. It is a whackjob liberal idea to uphold assault weapons as a "right" when children are being mowed down. Look to Australia for an example of what to do. "Australia's newly-elected prime minister at the time was John Howard. The country's most conservative leader in decades, openly proud of his pal status with George W. Bush, Prime Minister Howard led the then U.S. president to refer to his nation as America's "sheriff" in South East Asia. Just like President Obama, Howard was seen to weep and to offer the nation's prayers in the wake of another gun massacre. But only 12 days after the shootings, in Howard's first major act of leadership and by far the most popular in his first year as prime minister, his government announced nationwide gun law reform."</Msg><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1355934047621</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 11:20:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355934258711-18</Id><Title>#1 Software in the world, and will be #1 Hardware</Title><Msg>Once the surface numbers are out during Earnings announcemen in January, Wall Street will jump on this like flies on #$%$.</Msg><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1355934258711</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 11:24:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355934394444-19</Id><Topic><Title>#1 Software in the world, and will be #1 Hardware</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1355934258711</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 11:24:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If so what are the odds, MSFT tract record is not that good lately</Msg><Username>tradervic1963</Username><Timestamp>1355934394444</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 11:26:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355935623578-20</Id><Topic><Title>#1 Software in the world, and will be #1 Hardware</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1355934258711</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 11:24:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>msft has billions in the bank, being the 2nd largest and most profitable company in world, it has traded sideway for the last decade.

By comparison, the median firm in MSFT's industry rates a market score of 49, which indicates the market is paying a normal multiple of past performance trends for industry firms. MSFT's market score thus converts to its official in-industry PRVit score of 93. Performance Score (P): 84 Higher is better 0-19 20-39 40-59 60-79 80-100 MSFT's exceptionally strong return on capital, muted by a lackluster EVA profit trend, leads to a first rate, 84th percentile P score.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has stepped up manufacturing of the Surface tablet, its new device designed to counter Apple Inc's iPad, and will introduce it to third-party retailers this week. The moves suggest Microsoft is seeing some demand for its first own-brand computer in the crucial holiday shopping season, although it has yet to divulge any sales figures. "The public reaction to Surface has been exciting to see," said Panos Panay, general manager of Microsoft's Surface project, which forms part of the company's Windows unit. "We've increased production and are expanding the ways in which customers can interact with, experience and purchase Surface," said Panay, but gave no details of how many extra units were being produced. Panay did not mention names of retailers that will sell the Surface, but separately office equipment retailer Staples Inc said it would stock the tablet from Wednesday. He said the Surface would also be on sale at retailers in Australia from mid-December, with more countries to follow in the next few months. Since launch in late October, the Surface has only been sold by Microsoft itself, in its own brick and mortar stores in the United States and Canada and online in Australia, China, France, the UK and Germany. The only Surface model available now - officially called Surface with Windows RT - runs a version of Windows created to work on the low-power chips designed by ARM Holdings, which dominate smartphones and tablets but are incompatible with old Windows applications. It starts at $499 for the 32 gigabyte version plus $120 for a thin cover that doubles as a keyboard. A larger, heavier tablet - called Surface with Windows 8 Pro - will be introduced in January, running on an Intel Corp chip that works with all Microsoft's Windows and Office applications. Microsoft plans to price the new Surface from $899 for a 64 gigabyte version. The world's largest software company also said it would keep its chain of 'pop-up' holiday stores open into the new year and will convert them into permanent retail outlets or what it called "specialty store locations". Microsoft's recent push into physical retail - following Apple's great success - has resulted in 31 permanent stores plus 34 holiday ‘pop-up' stores in the U.S. and Canada. If Microsoft converted each of the temporary stores into permanent outlets it would have 65 stores, still well below Apple with almost 400 worldwide.

Shooting deaths in 2015 will probably rise to almost 33,000, and those related to autos will decline to about 32,000, based on the 10-year average trend. As the nation reels from the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the shift shows the effects of public policy, said Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis. The fall in traffic deaths resulted from safer vehicles, restricted privileges for young drivers and seat-belt and other laws, he said. By contrast, “we’ve made policy decisions that have had the impact of making the widest array of firearms available to the widest array of people under the widest array of conditions.” While fewer households have guns, people who own guns are buying more of them, he said. ********************************************************************************************* The number of right wing nut jobs is declining but they are getting whackier.</Msg><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1355943655346</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 14:00:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355943918361-52</Id><Topic><Title>Report: Little demand for Microsoft's Surface RT tablet</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1355941465259</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 13:24:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL!!!

The Yoga actually resembles the Surface but is a convertible. The Surface, as compared to a convertible, has to be assembled on a table top. Now Samsung has a 13.3" Series 9 laptop at 2.6 pounds weight. And the convertible tablets are too heavy at about 3.5 pounds weight. So the obvious thing to do is a Samsung 11.6" Series 9 convertible. The problem is that journalists and analysts have declared the price point to be $500. Well, isn't a really good computer more like $1000 ? And isn't the acceptance of a $500 price point an admission that ARM tablets are just coffee-shop browsers ? Now Samsung has a detachable tablet. The ATIV 500T is about $750 including optional keyboard and the ATIV 700T is about $1200 includng optional keyboard. Both will run Photoshop but the 500T is for longer battery life while the 700T is for higher performance. Then HP has an Elite Pad 900 tablet scheduled for January while Lenovo has a Thinkpad 2 tablet not yet available.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1355967935334</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 20:45:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355968034859-82</Id><Title>100 Best Companies to Work For</Title><Msg>Microsoft ranks number 76, three steps below Starbucks, and three steps above Mattel.

HP has a Elite Pad 900 tablet scheduled for January while Lenovo has a Thinkpad 2 tablet not yet available.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1355972786120</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 22:06:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355973523501-94</Id><Topic><Title>Surface abysmal sales</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355971751421</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 21:49:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go eat another dork dorkeater.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1355973523501</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 22:18:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355973760283-95</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT Surface DOA</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355972124325</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 21:55:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>M$FT prints money you stupid GD Troll.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1355973760283</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 22:22:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355974624664-96</Id><Topic><Title>Surface abysmal sales</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355971751421</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 21:49:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does your mom know that your are posting past your bedtime?</Msg><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355974624664</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 22:37:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355974706858-97</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT Surface DOA</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355972124325</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-19 21:55:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not any more!
