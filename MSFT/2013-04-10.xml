Big problem with Linux is: 1. Lacks critical mass. Windows runs just about anything that users want to run and Linux doesn't. 2. No good support 3. Too many flavors of Linux to choose so it is very confusing for the common user. 3. Linux community members are bad citizens who aren't really that helpful to new users. 4. confusing UI for such things as adding new drivers, adding and removing and removing applications. Most folks just don't want to take the time to learn the Linux way of doing things. Linux use is around 5% and has been that way for the last couple of years.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1365593614980</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 07:33:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365595180815-20</Id><Topic><Title>Five reasons why Windows 8 has failed</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1363976193416</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 14:16:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I dare you to define "Windows 8 brought many things innovative to the desktop." without including the pointless GUI change.

The mantra is that MSFT has gone nowhere for the past 5 years and has underperformed the market. Quite honestly the market has gone nowhere in 5 years. So while technically true that MSFT has gone nowhere in 5 years what you have to look at is relative performance vs the S&amp;P to see whether MSFT is underperforming or outperforming. Pull up a comparative chart of the S&amp;P and MSFT over the past 5 years and you will see what I mean. In some years MSFT has underperformed the S&amp;P and some years it has outperformed but by and large it has tracked the S&amp;P. Over the past year it has underperformed but during the 2013 MSFT is outperforming the market and I expect that to continue. So MSFT goes through these periods of underperformance and outperformance but it is not a perpetual under performer that bears want you to believe.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1365598078940</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 08:47:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365598306928-24</Id><Topic><Title>Why The Filibuster Threat On Gun Legislation By Republicans?</Title><Username>captain_zee</Username><Timestamp>1365466816137</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-08 20:20:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>get rid of cars...they hurt ,kill and injure too many folks...duh....take the mental patients back into the care facilities,they wont get nor have access to guns</Msg><Username>mickey_0066</Username><Timestamp>1365598306928</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 08:51:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365598642857-25</Id><Topic><Title>Big Volume, Still a Buy?</Title><Username>hugh_dawg</Username><Timestamp>1359170136948</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:15:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what I am looking for.</Msg><Username>poopoomilagros</Username><Timestamp>1365598642857</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 08:57:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365598996046-26</Id><Topic><Title>Five reasons why Windows 8 has failed</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1363976193416</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 14:16:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Evidence enough that ineedastock is our old friend wallyball.

The massive abundance of legacy Windows software is its greatest strength. But this strength only applies for traditional desktop apps which Microsoft no longer favors. When it comes to a new interface and new apps Android (Linux) and IOS are crushing Microsoft's Metro and its ecosystem. This is why it is in Microsoft's benefit to "fix" W8 for those that need or want to use traditional desktop apps while also giving Microsoft the greatest leverage. Microsoft's problem isn't lack of technology, it's arrogance and their absolute view that users must conform to their view of productivity.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1365602512472</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:01:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365603191189-38</Id><Title>dang, you could have bought April $30 options a few days ago for $0.01</Title><Msg>why did it pop so high so fast?</Msg><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1365603191189</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:13:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365603442134-39</Id><Title>Had to sell finally... bought low 26 range... good luck guys...</Title><Msg>sell in may and go away right around the corner..</Msg><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1365603442134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:17:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365603654288-40</Id><Topic><Title>Will Microsoft Bounce?</Title><Username>wanda.avila</Username><Timestamp>1361975704544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:35:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for sharing.</Msg><Username>hopephillips63</Username><Timestamp>1365603654288</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:20:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365603913747-41</Id><Topic><Title>Had to sell finally... bought low 26 range... good luck guys...</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1365603442134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:17:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One minute you claim you're on the side lines,the next you claim this thing will not go below $30 once there,now you're selling your fantasy position LOL congrats!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1365603913747</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:25:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365603994677-42</Id><Title>smoke comming out of my ears 2 days</Title><Msg>nice</Msg><Username>raggwead</Username><Timestamp>1365603994677</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:26:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365604132697-43</Id><Topic><Title>Had to sell finally... bought low 26 range... good luck guys...</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1365603442134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:17:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why you make shyte up.. are you a liar..

But that isn't what is happening. Sales of Mac are stagnating so folks still want their Windows apps but like iPhones so they want to load iTunes on Windows. "When it comes to a new interface and new apps Android (Linux) and IOS are crushing Microsoft's Metro and its ecosystem." Well, these are really just mobile OS's and have nothing to do with Linux and MAC and Windows Desktop proper. They have their root there but really you can't take an IOS app and load it on your Mac. It is true with WP8 too but mobile is a small but fast growing segment of Microsoft's business. WP O/S sales doubled year over year which is faster then IOS and android so your statement "crushing Microsoft Metro" is completely off base. "it's arrogance and their absolute view that users must conform to their view of productivity." That is your opinion but having worked in a Windows environment, working with Windows support people and sales people over a number of years as a career not a bystander, I have quite a different experience with Microsoft. They don't always get it right out of the box but they listen to their customers and correct their mistakes. If people turn out to not like Win8 then Microsoft will fix it very quickly. People hated Windows ME for good reason and it had a short lifespan.</Msg><Username>bjaythebear</Username><Timestamp>1365605257335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 10:47:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365605350414-60</Id><Title>That a boy Softie Run Run Run</Title><Msg>Windows 8 is a game changer.

It has clients like ATT Uverse and a reach of 11mm pay-TV subscribers. ERIC will now have a 25% multi-screen video market share, the largest in this space! CCUR is about to explode big time to $8 this afternoon and possibly $9 tomorrow as this news spreads! CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen platform has technology that pay-TV providers rate a lot higher than Mediaroom, with two huge clients: Virgin Media the largest cable TV operator in the UK and Jupiter the largest cable TV operator in Japan. CCUR's MediaHawk delivers their TV and on demand content to the mobile devices of 6.3mm pay-TV subscribers or 57% of Mediaroom's reach. If Mediaroom was acquired for just under $200mm, CCUR's MediaHawk must be worth appx $100mm! Currently, CCUR extremely profitable video business is not receiving any value at all! CCUR at $6.98 with 8.72mm shares outstanding has a market cap of only $60.87mm with $24.6mm in cash and an enterprise value of only $36.27mm. After subtracting $15mm for the price CCUR paid to acquire their Media Data Intelligence business, CCUR is only receiving $21.27mm in value for their real-time and video delivery solutions businesses combined! CCUR's real-time business has been operating for 47 years, providing ultra high performance real-time technology for time critical simulation devices used by the military and auto makers. It has 4 of the world's 5 largest defense contractors as clients and current annualized revenue of $27.6mm. It's worth a minimum of $25mm, leaving zero value left for CCUR's video delivery business! For CCUR's video business with its MediaHawk technology to be worth $100mm, CCUR needs to rise by $11.47 or 164% to $18.45! CCUR could rise to $8 today, $9 tomorrow, and $10 Friday, before exploding to $15+ next week! CCUR earned non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 last year and will earn non-GAAP EPS of at least $0.50 this year!</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1365612977384</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:56:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365614022158-80</Id><Topic><Title>Is Anyone Making Money WIth MSFT?</Title><Username>irenemontoya554</Username><Timestamp>1365081666691</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 09:21:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fantastic this is what a board can do when it works together</Msg><Username>mendozathad183</Username><Timestamp>1365614022158</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 13:13:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365614200945-81</Id><Topic><Title>Wayne LaPierre Is An ssA Boy For The Firearms Manufacturers!</Title><Username>captain_zee</Username><Timestamp>1365610962113</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 12:22:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>plmowrawn the whetback bellyaches about Americas failure to arm every man woman and child with an AK-47 so they can run around, scream and holler, squeeze off a few rounds every now and then just like the bloodthirsty Taliban murderers of Afganistan and Pakistan</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1365614200945</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 13:16:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365614201765-82</Id><Title>Mr Softy</Title><Msg>I had MSFT for years.

According to IDC study "Windows 8 actually deterred potential PC buyers as users felt they could not afford touch-screen models required to make the most of Windows 8." Because Microsoft forced Windows 8 on non-touch screen devices and removed the traditional desktop PC buyers were left with no good option other than to postpone buying, buy MAC or an Android tablet. RT is useless and consumers figured this out fast. Fortunately for Microsoft, Intel is delivering so much innovation to the PC &amp; tablet space Microsoft may get another chance at success. Microsoft needs to immediately fix Windows 8 and restore the W7 desktop for every PC user that wants it. They need to drastically cut the cost of Windows for the new class of Intel based Haswell and Baytrail tablets coming to the market and by doing this they may be able to compete against the same Intel powered tablets that will also be running Android, Ubuntu Touch and Tizen.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1365630556822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 17:49:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365631048631-123</Id><Title>Yes, Obama has been terrible for investors!

Another indicator of the horrible mess that is windoze 8. I love it..... ====================================== International Data Corp. says first-quarter computer shipments tumbled 14 percent from the previous year, much worse than the estimated 7.7 percent slide. First-quarter global computer shipments dropped 14 percent from the previous year, the tech research firm said, much worse than its forecast for a 7.7 percent decline. The extent of the pullback marked the worst ever quarter since IDC began tracking quarterly PC shipments in 1994, and it's the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment declines. All regions dropped in the period, despite improving economic conditions in some areas, IDC said. As if that wasn't enough, the main factor expected to boost the PC market -- the release of Microsoft's Windows 8 -- actually hurt computer shipments. And even if people desire PCs with touchscreens, they still cost too much and suffer from component shortages. IDC noted that innovations being pushed by PC makers are actually being viewed by consumers as "cumbersome or costly." ============================================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365631770992</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 18:09:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365631795850-128</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone notice after the runup the all day dither?</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1365620411544</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 15:00:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dither this you putz !</Msg><Username>pentomic</Username><Timestamp>1365631795850</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 18:09:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365631964550-129</Id><Title>my short at 30.25 working out well</Title><Msg>wow that was easy</Msg><Username>chairmanofthejointchiefsofbash</Username><Timestamp>1365631964550</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 18:12:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365632189344-130</Id><Topic><Title>Windows RT price cuts don’t stop the death spiral.

Worldwide PC shipments in the first quarter totaled 76.3 million units, down 13.9% compared to the same quarter last year, IDC said in research released on Wednesday. The decline was worse than 7.7% previously forecast by the analyst firm. PC shipments fell across all regions worldwide, and the market is headed into a further contraction than previously expected, IDC said in a statement. Windows 8 also did little to help PC shipments grow, IDC analysts said. Fewer consumers are upgrading PCs to Windows 8, while businesses are largely sticking with Windows 7 as the new OS does not fit into their usage model. Windows 8 has not been successful among mobile or desktop users, who have struggled adapting to its touch-based user interface, Daoud said, adding that users are also missing the Start button. Microsoft has to take quick corrective action to help the PC market, he said. ===================================================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365634599814</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 18:56:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365634691988-139</Id><Topic><Title>Yes, Obama has been terrible for investors!

The analyst firm released its rundown of global PC shipments on Tuesday, and the year-on-year double digit decline blows a cold wind for traditional PC makers like Dell and HP, and OS-slinger Microsoft. "It seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market," Bob O'Donnell, IDC's program vice president for clients and displays, said in a canned statement. "While some consumers appreciate the new form factors and touch capabilities of Windows 8, the radical changes to the UI, removal of the familiar Start button, and the costs associated with touch have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices. Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market."

It also excludes any device that has a detachable keyboard. With the release of Windows 8, PC makers have been reviving their experiments with tablet-laptop hybrids, some of which have detachable keyboards. Consumers are likely to have shifted some of their buying away from traditional laptops and toward these new devices, which means that the total sales decline of Windows-based devices may not be quite as drastic as IDC's numbers suggest.</Msg><Username>htyen1</Username><Timestamp>1365637767171</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 19:49:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365637961973-151</Id><Topic><Title>PC Sales Plummet, W8 Is The Reason</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1365630556822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 17:49:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You threatened whist too? you've been reported to the authorities, FOAD you ugly MEWLING QUIM!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1365637961973</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 19:52:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365638218642-152</Id><Topic><Title>PC Sales Plummet, W8 Is The Reason</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1365630556822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 17:49:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well you certainly are one of the least intelligent posters arent you phands- BTW you are going to be late to your nightly trysts with your Sailor bois tonight if you insist on posting</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1365638218642</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 19:56:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365639869167-153</Id><Topic><Title>PC Sales Plummet, W8 Is The Reason</Title><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1365630556822</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 17:49:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh? restore the desktop- but W-8 has the W-7 desktop-- all you gotta do is punch the Microsoft button on the bottom row of the keyboard- do you think you are smart enough to learn to do that???</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1365639869167</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 20:24:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365640636591-154</Id><Topic><Title>Obama selling TVA, Iz it a market oriented bit of genius ???</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1365637005965</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 19:36:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That may or may not be true, but I've always seen egghead spelled as one word.</Msg><Username>zingermaster</Username><Timestamp>1365640636591</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 20:37:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365641652103-155</Id><Title>MSFT PE 16.6....APPLE PE 10</Title><Msg>lol.
