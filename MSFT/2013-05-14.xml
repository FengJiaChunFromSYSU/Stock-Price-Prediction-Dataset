What can you say about an administration that lies systematically about events leading up to the torture-murder of one of its ambassadors, U.S, military personnel and other U.S. citizens in Benghazi? What can you say about an administration that uses drones to spy on its own citizens and to kill them overseas without due process? What can you say about an administration that monitors the phone records of the largest news-gathering organization in the world – and one of the friendliest to that administration? The only fair assessment is that it is a rogue administration – one that represents a frightening departure from any previous historical precedent in its authoritarian nature, one out of touch with the rule of law, one that is revealing itself to be prone to tyrannical policies and one that has committed so many impeachable offenses it’s becoming difficult to count them all. Obama is fighting off too many scandals – Benghazi-gate, IRS-gate and now Press-gate. If this were almost any other president in American history, he would already be writing his resignation letter.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1368525994415</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 06:06:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368527883881-10</Id><Title>Obama on Benghazi: "There is no 'there' there"</Title><Msg>Depends on what your definition of "is" is, Mr. Liar in Chief.

The Justice Department executed the nitty-gritty here: The records obtained by the Justice Department listed incoming and outgoing calls, and the duration of each call, for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and the main number for AP reporters in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. A release from the Associated Press notes that President and CEO Gary Pruitt has denounced the action in a May 13 letter: “There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters. These records potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period, provide a road map to AP’s newsgathering operations, and disclose information about AP’s activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know.” “We regard this action by the Department of Justice as a serious interference with AP’s constitutional rights to gather and report the news.”</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368532008876</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 07:46:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368532327005-13</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT Option Activity May 8/2013....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368484168944</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 18:29:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IT seems one investors is getting ready to take a large position without buying up 270 million shares at once and will take possession on Friday on Options Expiry Day.

The Jews, Christians and most tragically the Kurds would not agree with you over the "unjustified war". However, saying if that was true, you are saying anything that Obama is caught in can never be discussed because of something that Bush did is incredibly stupid. On the other hand, Obama doing nothing in Syria has cost 90,000 lives. Whether you agree that is a good thing or a bad thing, it is a result of America doing nothing. His do nothing policy has resulted in America's problems, with Russia,Iran and the Arab world have all become inarguably worse since Obama came to office. The last time America took an isolationist view ended in Sep of 1939. Personal charisma just doesn't hack it in the real world.

Security researcher and creator of p0wnlabs, Jeff Bryner, showcased the Kinectasploit game at Defcon 20. The game is a product of the improbable melding of Microsoft's Kinect gaming motion-sensor with hacking tools such as Metasploit. Together with the Blender 3D environment toolkit, Kinectasploit allows hackers to break wireless networks, launch web attacks and run forensics using body gestures in the style of a first person shooter. Players are represented as an avatar within a series of three-dimensional rooms, each one housing different hacking tools which materialise from the walls in an event inspired from a scene in The Matrix. Kinectasploit hackers choose from a cyber arsenal of 20 tools that includes Snort, Nessus, John the Ripper and Ettercap. They navigate the game by using full body motion; leaning will move the character in a corresponding direction, pivoting at the hip turns the character, and a series of arm gestures can execute commands. In a demonstration, Bryner hacked into a target and retrieved and forensically analysed a file from Windows machine recycle bin folders. He began by scanning for targets and cracking a WEP key by shooting a "fireball" at an access point to select it, and then dumping packets - illustrated by balls of packets being sucked towards the player. He then showcased the Nessus room which was depicted as a hospital where the victim machine appeared on an operating table for scanning.

Speaking at the J.P. Morgan Technology, Media &amp; Telecom Conference, Reller reiterated Microsoft's assertion that it has sold more 100 million licenses for Windows 8. Reller, who is chief financial officer and chief marketing officer of Microsoft's Windows division, said the company would release Windows 8.1, formerly called Windows Blue, as a free update to Windows 8 later this year. As Reller spoke, Microsoft shares rose over 50 cents to $33.34.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368544612400</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:16:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368545277235-67</Id><Title>So over bought manipulated</Title><Msg>Same old Wall Street games just keep upgrading different stocks/sectors daily to move markets.

Emotionless bots are programmed to buy or sell on price without consideration for volume demand. Couple that with the Fed pumping the market and you have a market rise on no demand (no volume). If you are short it is possible to continue longer than you can stay liquid but because there will also be a cascade effcet should there be any black swan event the possibility of a crash is far greater than a huge surge. There is no further argument otherwise, the market is being coordinated and manipulated, and that will work until volume sellers hit. Down days volume increases, up days are largely bot A selling to bot B in my opinion to toll in the chasers.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368546919991</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:55:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368547093306-82</Id><Topic><Title>WHY Would Someone Buy 2.7 Million Calls Contracts 4 Days Before Expiry....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368537577549</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 09:19:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good point and this is such a large bet that points to a very bullish stance on Microsoft.</Msg><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1368547093306</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:58:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368547233465-83</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's Reller touts Windows 8 success....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368544612400</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 11:16:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I not with interest and not a little skepticism that Reller didn't differentiate between licenses "sold" into the channel and those that have wound up in the hands of consumers and businesses that have "broken the shrink" and actually deployed the mess.

The shift will not only cause oil companies to overhaul their global investment strategies, but also reshape the way oil is transported, stored and refined. According to the MTOMR, the effects of continued growth in North American supply – led by US light, tight oil (LTO) and Canadian oil sands – will cascade through the global oil market. Although shale oil development outside North America may not be a large-scale reality during the report’s five-year timeframe, the technologies responsible for the boom will increase production from mature, conventional fields – causing companies to reconsider investments in higher-risk areas. In virtually every other aspect of the market, developing economies are in the driver’s seat. This quarter, for the first time, non-OECD economies will overtake OECD nations in oil demand. At the same time, massive refinery capacity increases in non-OECD economies are accelerating a broad restructuring of the global refining industry and oil trading patterns. European refiners will see no let-up from the squeeze caused by increasing US product exports and the new Asian and Middle Eastern refining titans.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1368549631950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:40:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368549668647-108</Id><Topic><Title>I say release your numbers</Title><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1368549182925</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:33:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes the businesses are upgrading to Windows 7 as they are migrating from XP and as Windows 8 becomes the standard, they will adopt Windows 8 so to integrate their Mobility and Desktop platforms.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368549668647</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:41:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368549815790-109</Id><Topic><Title>I say release your numbers</Title><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1368549182925</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:33:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NO they won't. they will skip 8 all together.

The bulk of the nation's energy development boom is occurring on private and state land, and is declining on federally controlled land. In fact, in a March report, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) states that President Obama’s policies have handicapped oil-and-gas production on federal lands. Despite the glaring and desperate irony, the president often proclaims that oil-and-gas drilling has spiked under his watch. No mention of the fact that he has no effect up or down in the private and state sectors.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1368555218607</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 14:13:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368555352245-154</Id><Topic><Title>Who Is Winning the Mobile App Store Wars?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368552534065</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 13:28:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I am write apps..."

There are some large DOD contracts where the guy in charge of the contract is saying he wants to switch to all Windows 8 phones, Surface tablets and PC's. It is a friggin Wave of power. Nokia is flying under the radar of the smart money. Trust me, Nokia is not going anywhere and may already be part of Microsoft you just do not know it. The other phones are basically POS SPECIALS. Samsung is history next year "don't let the door hit you in the can on the way out". HTC is on the verge of a going under. The Chinese phones are only good for overseas. Let them stay, they will help overseas. Lenovo will be coming but it is not the same as Nokia. The Nokia LUMIA phones were designed with Microsoft (co-design experience). They have ad revenue sharing, here (Nokia) maps sharing etc. The share intellectual property and the have a legal business partnership. If you own Microsoft and do not own Nokia, you need to do more research. I own both and they cannot be owned separately in my opinion.

Reller also emphasized that many of the consumer apps people want are starting to appear on Windows 8: Urban Spoon, Twitter, MLB.TV, Museums of the World.

Quoting: "The Windows 8 app store is perhaps the most controversial feature in Microsoft’s new operating system. Windows has thrived for decades because of its openness to developers and willingness to let them take both the spotlight and the profits. Some developers – like Marcus Persson, the creator of Minecraft – have denounced Microsoft’s store as a blatant attempt to make Windows a closed platform. "Microsoft may turn out to be the greatest ally of its critics. Though the Windows 8 store exists, the company doesn’t seem to care about its quality. Redmond has released a sloppy, inefficient, obtuse store that’s arguably the worst store baked into any modern OS. In short, it’s a disaster. "The store is full of shovelware "Windows 8 is not Microsoft’s first attempt at a store. The company already created two for Xbox Live. One, Xbox Live Arcade, is a pleasant curated experience filled with games that range from playable to amazing. The other, Xbox Live Indie Games, is an anything-goes mess. "Microsoft has used the latter to model the Windows 8 store. While there are some decent apps, many are shovelware. They either don’t work as advertised or work poorly. And some stand on questionable legal grounds."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368563624641</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:33:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368563833839-240</Id><Topic><Title>New hearings and investigations</Title><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1368563407705</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:30:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not hawcreek.

Every American deserves to find out about the fantastic rights they have as an individual, and about the wonderfully severe limitations on what the federal government can do to interfere in their personal daily affairs. Then they can decide whether they want to vote for progressive liberal collectivist destroyers or traditional mainstream conservative Americans. That's all.

Microsoft claimed last week that it's made '100 million' Windows 8 sales and the claim has been widely repeated. But channel feedback and the experience on the ground point to a very different picture. The Guardian's Charles Arthur has made a stab at estimating the true figure, and suggests it's much less, at between 57 million and 59 million machines running Redmond's latest OS. Arthur looks at two metrics of browser usage: StatCounter and Net Applications' NetMarketShare, and extrapolates a usage figure from the number of PCs actually shipped. The logic here is that browser usage is a reliable proxy for real-world usage. Which is solid, unless we are to believe that many Windows 8 machines are in use but do not access the internet. Perhaps they're pushed into use as departmental servers? Or perhaps they're used by determined accountants who are so busy with Excel that they never check Facebook. But how likely is that? From this metric, both figures (57.3m and 59.25m) are far lower than the 100m licenses Redmond claim. Only one third of new PCs are running Windows 8. But for some it's lower. Windows 8 PCs can ship as "downgraded by default" - with the new Tile-centric OS bundled in a box. Lenovo confirmed that many of its "Windows 8 shipments" are just this configuration. That's a "license" that has "shipped", but it's not a PC running Windows 8.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368565436336</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 17:03:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368565480127-254</Id><Topic><Title>New hearings and investigations</Title><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1368563407705</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 16:30:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, I see.

Obama voted in support of infanticide on multiple occasions when he was in the Illinois Senate. He even delivered a floor speech in support of his vote. The proof is in the Illinois Senate records and the testimony of his co-senators at the time. Obama has woven a fog shrouded narrative around this issue claiming that he would have supported the, "Born Alive Infants Protection Act" if that was what the Illinois Senate bill was ... but the verifiable fact is that the wording of the Illinois Senate bill which he rejected was the same bill as that which became federal law. Obama is a liar and a supporter of infanticide.

According to malware researchers at F-Secure Labs, the number of active mobile threat families and variants initially spiked in the winter quarter, with Android's share jumping from 49 out of 74 known threats to 96 out of 100, with the balance being related to Nokia's essentially mothballed Symbian platform. That was enough to rouse a tweet from the rarely used account of Apple's head of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller, who linked to the report with the brief admonition "be safe out there." However, F-Secure's new report for the latest quarter shows Android now accounts for 136 out of 149 known threats, or 91.3 percent of all malware activity (up from 79 percent in 2012). The other threats remained related to Symbian, with zero discovered for Blackberry, Microsoft's Windows Mobile/Phone or Apple's iOS. The research noted that mobile threats are overwhelmingly motivated by profits, with 76.5 percent designed specifically to con users out of money, rather than seeking to just cause damage.

Additionally, examples of increased commoditization of Android malware surfaced. The new Android techniques are a cause for concern, says Sean Sullivan, Security Advisor at F-Secure Labs. “I’ll put it this way: Until now, I haven’t worried about my mother with her Android because she’s not into apps. Now I have reason to worry because with cases like Stels, Android malware is also being distributed via spam, and my mother checks her email from her phone.” The Android trojan known as Stels began distributing via fake U.S. Internal Revenue Service-themed emails, using an "Android Crimeware Kit" to steal sensitive information from the device, and monetizing by making calls to premium numbers. This example of mobile malware commoditization “could be a game changer,” according to Sullivan. Q1 also saw the first confirmed targeted attacks in the mobile space. Tibetan human rights activists were targeted with emails that contained an Android-malware-infected attachment, and a so-called “coupon app” for a popular coffee chain steals information from phones with South Korean country codes. Mobile is being targeted in India, as the discovery of the first Android advanced fee fraud proved. A fake “job offer” Android app in India informs that the user is being considered for a position at TATA Group, an Indian multinational company. To arrange the interview, the app asks for a refundable security deposit.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368574953214</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 19:42:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368575344453-307</Id><Topic><Title>Will Obama Pardon Baby Killer Gosnell?</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1368569530946</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 18:12:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama and Gosnell are "soul buddies" ... both big promoters of infanticide.

In a way, Android is experiencing the same fate as Windows where its huge market share works in both good and bad ways. Such popularity certainly translates well in terms of sales, but it also appeals to the maliciously-minded crowds.

Even lawmakers sometimes struggle. At Rep. Steny Hoyer's weekly meeting with reporters on Tuesday, the Maryland Democrat was asked if he was concerned about the DOJ seizing phone records from Associated Press journalists working in the House press gallery in the Capitol building. Hoyer's answer was well-delivered: Articulate, clear, firm and precise. One problem: He responded to the wrong scandal. "The IRS activity was inappropriate, inconsistent with our policies and practices as a country, very concerning, needs to be reviewed carefully," Hoyer, one of the top-ranking House Democrats, said in response to a question from Fox News' Chad Pergram about the DOJ. "We need to ensure that this does not happen again, and we need to find out how long it continued, when it was stopped. It is my understanding—there was a front-page story on this at the [Washington] Post—it's my understanding that [IRS official] Lois Lerner, who was apparently overseeing this, at some point in time found out about this and said ..." When Hoyer named Lerner, Pergram interrupted. "We're talking about two things," Pergram, who apparently had not heard the first mention of the IRS, said from across the table, "You said Lois Lerner and the IRS."</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368585847202</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 22:44:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368585984305-342</Id><Title>over 5 million shares trade AH....MSFT</Title><Msg>decent amount....</Msg><Username>trendpicker</Username><Timestamp>1368585984305</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 22:46:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368586326208-343</Id><Title>I hate Windows 8 and Metro!</Title><Msg>No way I'm spending $1000 for an Ultrabook or Surface Pro with Windows 8.
