Your team is not imaginary. Of course GM has not been saved to you, now, under good President Obama. If you read, it is under Ronmey that you will heap credit on. Praising Ronmey for saving and restoring GM, with the same Obama ideas. Ronmey is as good as on the assembly line himself punching out the new cars alone. Romney himself took credit for GM when Obama's plan worked, and after the fact. Till then it was Obama bashing day and night. Obama's success shut most up, except old holdouts like you.

The libs called it "red lining" and made the compassionate appeal to the voters that the rich guy banks were preventing poor folks from owning a home as if it was an entitlement. Barney Franks pushed, and helped put teeth into the Community Reorganization ACT as well as Slick Willy, and the rest is history. Banks were forced to make loans, and Barney promised that Fanny and Freddie would buy up the risky loans, and remove the risk from the banks. "You just write the loans, and we will buy them up." Along with low loan rates this created the speculative buying frenzy as well as the subprime loans. In the end, Alan Greenspan, Mr. economy guru, said that he miscalculated the impact on the overall economy from the subprime loans. He stated he thought it would have a minumum effect when it had a major effect. But then Barney and friends highly leveraging these loans selling "bundled" loan packages called (??) to foreign Central banks, and the entire packages went under because of the bad home loans brought down world economies. Totally a lbieral playground of squandering tax payer money...Barney, Freddie, and Fanny.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1359848023952</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 18:33:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359849412564-20</Id><Topic><Title>160,000 leave labor force and still jobless rate ticks up to 7.9%</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1359797216707</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 04:26:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And all the liberal media talks about is that some 150,000 jobs were created!
