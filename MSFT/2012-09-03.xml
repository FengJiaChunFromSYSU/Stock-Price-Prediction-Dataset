So, he was telling us that Harvard Lawyer Obama is a bad choice but Harvard Lawyer Romney who also happens to be tax cheat would make good president. 2. Obama did not learn from Russia's war with Afghanistan. So, am I supposed to believe that Obama started Afghanistan War? Thank you Mr. Eastwood. You Made my day by talking to Invisible Obama.

Five states now require a woman, before an abortion, to endure an ultrasound that may use a probe inserted into her vagina. Four of those states make no exception for a rape. And if the Republican Party succeeds in defunding Planned Parenthood, the result will be more women dying of cervical cancer and fewer women getting contraception. The consequence will probably be more unintended pregnancies — and more abortions. Or there’s sex education. Today in America, more than one-third of teens say that when they began having sex, they had not had any formal instruction about contraception. Is this really the time for a Republican Party platform denouncing comprehensive sex education? Some Americans don’t even seem to have had any sex education by the time they’re elected to Congress. Like Todd Akin.</Msg><Username>therwnjneedhelp</Username><Timestamp>1346675685998</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 08:34:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346680492166-12</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan Lies Like Richard Nixon</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1346614413112</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-02 15:33:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most of us were there in 2011 when bachmann etc said let the country go into default, that's a D debt rating folks.
