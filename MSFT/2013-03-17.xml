I just uninstalled IE10. IT DOES NOT WORK WITH VISUAL STUDIO 2010. I installed Visual Studio 2012 and it apparently didn't install cleanly even though it gave no indications. Every time I started it up it said it was corrupted but started up anyways. Weird! SharePoint 2010 is the software I'm using at work and it is one of the most unintuitive, buggy piece of you know what. I've been in the software industry as long as you and it's getting worse. I will not upgrade anymore software! Junk, junk junk! Apple software is only slightly better as I tried to update my the music on my iTunes only to see the interface and changed and it is unintuitive also. Had to google to try and figure out how to use it. I'm turning off all updates to all software because the ethics of the software industry has turned to garbage. Yet they don't want to hire people that are experienced because they think they cost too much. I've seen IBM almost go bankrupt, DEC, Sun, Silicon Graphics, and Compaq disappear. I think you are on your way to going the same route with releasing buggy software. Just keep pushing people to phones because your desktop software is starting to suck! Solution to problem: Hire older people who are experienced at testing and releasing software. The college grads may be smart but inexperience resorts to release anything.</Msg><Username>gr8fun4me</Username><Timestamp>1363532862567</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 11:07:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363533253112-13</Id><Topic><Title>The new rich: Chelsea Clinton Buying $10 Million NYC Apartment</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1363478389320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 19:59:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The question was what did you and they produce.

Thanks for the tip. It looks like it will use Bluetooth to ID your mobile phone and then use the Kinect connection to ID your face at the cash register from some remote database. This provides a two factor authentication to charge the purchase to your handset. That way if you lose your phone all someone needs is a picture of you and a USB cable or a battery charger to purchase what they want on your account with your carrier.

CRIME, FRAUD, COUNTERFEIT, NARCOTICS ACTIVITY, AND MONEY LAUNDERING ALL FLOURISH. THE VATICAN BANK IS RUN LIKE ALL THE REST, PROTECTED FOR ITS SCUMMY DEALINGS AND COMPLICITY TO MURDER AT ARM'S LENGTH. TAKE A WALK ALONG MEMORY LANE FOR A BRIEF HISTORY. $$$ The image of the Vatican Bank, formally known as the Institute for Works of Religion, has been badly tarnished in the last decade or two. It has been linked in clear terms to criminal activity. The paths to its bank are littered with corpses of avid Roman investigative reporters trying to obtain a story. The secretive Vatican Bank was established in 1942 by Pope Pius XII so as to manage the vast Vatican finances. Its operation is run by a CEO and overseen by five cardinals like a Board who report directly to the Pope. The Jesuit bankers are in charge, known as the dark catholics or the black cardinals. In my opinion they follow the Prince of Darkness from the nether domain, complete with child sacrifices. Their advanced communication center connects the covens of the world, according to a direct contact who endured a two-year internship 15 years ago in Rome. The bank has extensive ties to the central banks of the West, with a long history of deals, back scratching deals like hired mules to move bearer bonds, like leasing gold, like arrangement for murders. The official Vatican Bank charter is to safeguard assets and to administer property dedicated for works of religion or charity. The actual activities of the bank are somewhat different. They include money laundering for narcotics traffickers, bribery, skimming charitable funds to enrich priests, and tax evasion means for wealthy Italians extending a hand into the Holy See. The bank answers to nobody, since the pope is left uninformed, and the Holy See is a sovereign city state. If a pope attempts to interfere or to expose the corrupt dealings or sexual underworld, he ends up like John Paul I, who was treated to a heart attack in his first month. Injection of potassium is my guess. My belief is firm, not a natural event. The door to sexual impropriety was exposed by American monsignor Paul Marcinkus, the chief of the Vatican Bank from 1971 to 1989, whose tenure was mired with scandal. The scandals tied to the Vatican Bank of the last few decades are so despicable and heinous that they defy the imagination for the majority of religious observers who conjure thoughts of foreign missions and UNICEF for children and hunger. In medieval times when Martin Luther roamed Europe, the past offenses were to sell indulgences and to charge fees for sacraments. They have been updated and modernized in adaptation to the elevated criminal level of modern finance, complete with shell companies like for Manhattan property and London property (SEE LINK), speculation in popular leveraged financial instruments, and secret transfers such as bearer bond mule traffic like seen at the Swiss border in 2009. Roman journalists and reporters routinely attempt to penetrate the Vatican. Last year, Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi published a book delving into the intrigue and corruption swirling in a bank that is accountable to no one. It was a shocker. He might be killed for it. The door swung wide open for light to shine on the dark side where the Jesuit bankers operate. In May 2012, the butler to Pope Benedict was arrested for leaking documents bursting with juicy evidence of financial corruption and criminal activity. The Vatican has been in league with major Italian companies on shady dealings. The last Vatican Bank chairman, Ettore Gotti Tedeschi, was fired when the bank was caught hip deep in international money laundering. The bank has been serving as a rogue offshore vehicle favored by widespread politicians, mafia figures, and tax evaders. Recent information from a USGovt source indicates that Obama, Geithner, other leading figures, and even Bill Gates from Microsoft infamy, each own slush fund accounts at the Vatican Bank, many of which were fed by the raided Falcone account. The source has been reliable over half the time in intriguing stories. My belief is that Gates is being paid for his service on developing a virus arsenal toward African genocide under the guise of HIV vaccine. The Vatican is Cayman squared for the elite.</Msg><Username>bdannye</Username><Timestamp>1363565541508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 20:12:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363568342645-40</Id><Topic><Title>dude..like apple OS and like linux is like cooler dude...like for servers..UNIX..dude..wow dude</Title><Username>bizbladio</Username><Timestamp>1363457500480</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 14:11:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well, wally, you seem to texpect people to take advice from a total #$%$ like you.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1363568342645</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 20:59:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363568426870-41</Id><Topic><Title>Is This Tech Giant Falling Behind in a Critical New Market?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1363514017758</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 05:53:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They're not falling behind at all: they're not even in the game.
