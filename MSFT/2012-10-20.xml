Microsoft opened up Windows Phone to devices with lower specifications, prompting phones like the Lumia 610 with an 800Mhz processor and only 256MB of RAM to play with. Looks like Skype isn’t the only app having problems with the meagre amount of memory. The Lumia 610 is starting to ship to customers across Europe, and already reports are coming in that more apps are being restricted on the handset. Last week Nokia and Microsoft pulled Skype for the Lumia 610, but other apps including Angry Birds, PES 2012, and Tango refuse to install. When you browse those options on the market, you’re greeting with a message that the app “requires a phone with more RAM than the Nokia Lumia 610.” We’ve confirmed that these apps are unavailable on our Lumia 610 review unit, and have run into a few others that won’t install either, including the official Google app. Microsoft say that only around 5% of apps won’t be able to run on the 610, but so far everything that refuses to install seem to be quality apps that would showcase the platform. Not only that, but we’ve run into problems with apps that require a lot of caching – such as IMDB and Nokia Maps – crashing under load. It presents a huge problem for Microsoft going forward: if developers don’t (or worse, can’t) tweak their apps to run on 256MB of RAM, it sets a dangerous precedent for the platform and presents a bad user experience if consumers can’t get their hands on apps that help sell the OS. We can only wait and see what happens going forward, but this should be a big concern for Microsoft and developers.

You have a job and pay tax on your salary, done. You take that taxed money and put it in a savings account and it earns interest. You are taxed on the interest, done. That is not double taxing. Tax is on any new income. you're trying to double talk it.. Earnings retained means what? Disrributions later means what? Earnings retained is your savings account. Distributions later is like the interst earned on the savings account, or if distributed to another entity, of course the other entity pays tax on their income seperately.

Romney will cut everyone's taxes by 20%, expand the military by $2 trillion, paid down the debt AND balance the budget!! It's to his advantage to exploit that fantasy. But he won't tell you how the math works. Wait until ater the election then he'll tell you. That's when you grab your ankles and get ready to be exploited.

The most tragic day in America's history was when some anti American more ons put a Musllim monkey from Kenya in the white house that sat in a racist Black Panther church for well over 20 years. This country has no POTUS but it will when president Romney guides the country to strength and prosperity and the best part is he's not Musllim and he is DEFINITELY an American unlike the blood thirsty clueless Kenyan.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350767423049</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 17:10:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350770712619-76</Id><Topic><Title>America as a family business Will we be better off with Romney??</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1350741652109</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-20 10:00:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Quote of the Decade: "The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure.
