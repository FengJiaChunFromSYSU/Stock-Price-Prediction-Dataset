UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest private health insurance company, has announced its intent to continue allowing parents to keep their kids under the age of 26 on their insurance policies while also sticking with the concept of providing their customers with preventative medical care without need for co-pay or other additional out-of-pocket charges, no matter what the future of Obamacare may be. Apparently, UnitedHealthcare has discovered that—in both the short and long term—health care reform had it right when it comes to the savings to be accomplished when encouraging customers to take care of themselves before they fall ill. The approach also saves the insurance company money by fostering patient practices designed to discover disease early, thereby avoiding the far higher costs that attach when illness becomes more serios to treat. Both you and your alias here are liars. Sitting there unemployed, not paying income tax, calling others who work hard all day freeloaders.

Quoting: "Chromebooks, for anyone who needs reminding, are low-cost “stateless” (i.e., no hard drive) notebooks that run Google’s Chrome OS and need to be connected to the cloud to function." ... "I note that my own kids are mostly using Google Docs in school and browsers for pretty much everything. Although my boy does some gaming that works better with a local client, my girl could do everything in the cloud. Our school system has standardized on Google for software and Apple for hardware. But that Apple hardware is expensive, and a conversion to Chromebooks would be easy on top of the existing infrastructure. "So, the education segment represents a great target. Secondary schools love the easy remote management, the low cost, and the security of a stateless device that doesn’t need to be maintained or upgraded. "Another class of consumer that seems to like Chromebooks is übergeeks, highly tech savvy people who own a number of devices and want a secure and somewhat untrackable PC-like system that doesn’t keep cookies, browsing history, and other dirty little fingerprints that tell where the user has been." ... "Acer recently made a public statement saying that 5-10% of its U.S. PC shipments are Chromebooks these days.

Oh, and by teaming up I mean that Microsoft is footing the bill for this. Sponsoring the commercial-free access to Windows Phone users as a way to celebrate Pandora's app arrival on Windows Phone is a smart move for both companies. Microsoft will be able to set itself apart. There are 67.7 million active monthly users of Pandora, and one can safely imagine that a lot of them would love to have the ad-free experience for free. The Pandora app also offers a unique Kid's Corner feature in the Windows Phone version where parents can make sure that their kids aren't hearing explicit lyrics. This is also a big win for Pandora. There are plenty of companies that have either jumped into the personalized radio niche or are negotiating with record labels to introduce streaming music services later this year.</Msg><Username>qikceltic</Username><Timestamp>1363967624419</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:53:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363967830024-31</Id><Topic><Title>Oh look up 80 to 14,500.00 and dithering again.

Love it: w8 is a giant flop...... ================================ Summary: The numbers are in and they don't lie. Windows 8 market adoption numbers are well behind Microsoft's greatest previous operating system failure, Vista. Windows 8's failure is actually greater than it appears. The tablet and phone markets in 2007 were next to non-existent. Now, in a market where NPD expects tablets to out sell notebooks by year's end, neither Windows 8 nor its cousins Windows RT and Windows Phone 8 even appear on NetApplication's mobile and tablet reports for February 2013. How bad is that? Android 1.6, with is tiny 0.02% of the market, does make the list. I predicted that Windows 8 would be dead on arrival last year, but it's flopping even more than I thought it would be. So, why has Windows 8 been such a failure? Here's my list: 1. Metro, aka Modern: An ugly, useless interface. 2. Windows 8 brought nothing innovative to the desktop. 3. Developers hate it. 4. Legacy Windows 7 users aren't moving. 5. Tablet, smartphone, and desktop competition. ================================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1363976193416</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 14:16:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363976300199-45</Id><Topic><Title>Marines killed in tragic murder suicide, look for left to call for them to give up weapons</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1363966109529</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 11:28:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Marines killed in tragic murder suicide, look for the right to call for more weapons and politicize the tragedy.

The demo bypasses a centralized server and instead makes a direct peer-to-peer connection between browsers. The key component of the demo is a set of work-in-progress standards known as WebRTC. WebRTC is a proposed standard — currently being refined by the W3C — with the goal of providing a web-based set of tools that any device can use to share audio, video and data in real time. It’s still in the early stages, but WebRTC has the potential to supplant Skype, Flash and many device-native apps with web-based alternatives that work on any device. The app that the Chrome and Firefox teams developed is available on Google Code and there’s a demo app available on Google app engine if you’d like to try it out for yourself. To make it work you’ll need to use either Firefox Nightly or Chrome 25 (currently in the beta channel). In Firefox, you’ll need to go to about:config and set media.peerconnection.enabled to “true.” Mozilla has previously showed off a demo of WebRTC with it Social API and Chrome has previously used parts of WebRTC for an interactive sand sketching experiment. This latest demo relies on a new WebRTC trick known as RTCPeerConnection, which should arrive in final form in Chrome next month and Firefox around the end of May. The RTCPeerConnection support in both browsers means there’s no need for plugins and developers can rest assured their apps will “just work” across browsers. Together Chrome and Firefox account for just under 60 percent of browsers on the web. There is of course one other major browser that’s not yet coming to the WebRTC party. Indeed Microsoft has proposed a WebRTC competitor to the W3C, though thus far little has happened beyond the initial proposal. As it stands now neither WebRTC nor Microsoft’s competing CU-RTC-Web proposal are actual W3C standards, but work is progressing on WebRTC and, with browsers already implementing it in the wild, it stands a much better chance of becoming a standard one day. It’s still a little early to throw out Skype. For now you’ll have to content yourself with a very cool demo and the tantalizing possibility to one day soon you might not need Skype, Facebook or any other third-party server to chat with friends around the web.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1363986442691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 17:07:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363986900621-54</Id><Topic><Title>Rumor has it Xbox 720</Title><Username>creephhi</Username><Timestamp>1363971310196</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 12:55:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No so much I have good sources.</Msg><Username>creephhi</Username><Timestamp>1363986900621</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 17:15:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363999104140-55</Id><Topic><Title>THERE GOES YOU SKYPE BILLIONS:Google, Mozilla Team Up for Skype-Killing Video Call Demo</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1363986442691</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-22 17:07:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is great news.
