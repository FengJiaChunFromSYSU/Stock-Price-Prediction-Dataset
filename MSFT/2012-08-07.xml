It is indeed pathetic that you're reduced to doing nothing but posting garbage endlessly in response to your single multi-nymed European adversary on this message board and can't find any buyers for the swampland you speculated in during the Bush Bubble or any bagholders stupid enough to buy any of the worthless stocks you bought into on the basis of your "financial insights". Your anticipation that a Romney Presidency would return you to the "high flying" years during which rampant deficit spending by Republican "fiscal conservatives" floated your asset bubble driven financial boat is just as confused as your other bizarre notions.

Wind River's adoption of Linux happened more recently than that. Quoting a bit more from Wikipedia: "Wind River Linux "Wind River's Linux product is source code and a build system that generate runtime images suitable for embedded devices. It supports a variety of architectures, including ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, IA32 and SPARC. "In 2004, Wind River announced a partnership with Red Hat to create a new Linux-based distribution for embedded devices.[10] Wind River has since ended its partnership with Red Hat and now ships its own Linux distribution optimized for embedded Linux development. "Wind River released the first version of its embedded Linux distribution, Platform for Network Equipment - Linux Edition (PNE-LE) 1.0 in 2005.[11] It was registered against the Carrier Grade Linux 2.0 specification and supported IA32 and PPC architectures. They added other platforms in subsequent releases, General Purpose Platform - Linux Edition (GPP-LE) and Platform for Consumer Devices - Linux Edition PCD-LE) starting in version 1.4. "On March 16, 2009, Wind River announced Wind River Linux 3.0.[12] "On February 20, 2007, FSMLabs' embedded market was acquired by Wind River Systems. Wind River maintains the free versions of RTLinux previously offered by FSMLabs;[13] and Wind River committed to continue to offer the FSMLab approach to RTLinux as part of their product line rebranded as Wind River Real-Time Core for Wind River Linux. "On August 7, 2007, Palm Inc. announced that it had chosen Wind River Systems as the software solution for its (later aborted) Palm Foleo. "In 2008, Wind River announced cooperation with BMW, Intel and Magneti Marelli for development of a Linux-based open-source platform to control in-car electronics,[14] which was extended in the GENIVI Alliance in 2009.[15]" ______________________________________ So Wind River definitely is involved with Linux. What's not clear to me is what kernel underlies current versions of VwWorks, and in particular the one that controls Curiosity on Mars. Wind River ads make much of providing "deterministic realtime" systems, meaning that responses are guaranteed to occur within a certain time interval, and Linux as normally designed doesn't necessarily make such a guarantee, even if it does beat the time limit on average. Wind River is certainly capable of modifying the Linux kernel to provide "deterministic realtime" performance, but whether it has or not is not clear from information I've seen so far.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1344349148000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 10:19:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344350595000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: America needs "soul searching"</Title><Username>hawcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1344341387000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 08:09:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is funny that all these liberals that loved Clinton don't realize his biggest accomplishments were adopting Republican policies.

If Romney paid his taxes then lets see his returns eh? If his grades were poor, he's been president for 3.5 years - who would care now? If Obama had poor grades then Romney must have had 4 years of strait F's If he had poor grades at Occidental, how did he get admitted to an Ivy League school?

If he had student loans or scholarships, how did he keep them if his grades weren't good?- looks like you have completed the proof- his grades had to be good then QED Most likely, Obama got admitted to both Occidental and Columbia as a foreign exchange student, being raised as a citizen of Indonesia.

That's not a flashy or sexy product line, but it makes them a lot of money. That’s why Koch Industries is the largest privately held company in the United States. Libertarians David and Charles Koch also do something that far too few big business owners in this country do. They use their money and influence to help promote the free market principles that allowed them to become so successful in the first place. In addition, they've generously donated more than 600 million dollars to hospitals, theaters, museums, and cancer centers among other worthy causes.

Now, "we become the first to crack the code on costs." Hundreds of health care leaders joined Patrick Monday to endorse the law… Patrick, who made tackling health care costs a top priority, gave credit to the broad coalition that helped to pass the state’s access law and seems to be holding together to lower costs .&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Crper, you will notice that Patrick gave credit to the broad coalition that passed "RomneyCare". Since he was Gov of a liberal state he had to go along with what they and the people wanted. Not like Obama jamming it down the majorities's throats that didn't want what he was pushing.

Such speculations are just that, speculations. Certain aspects of my own experience incline me toward the view that he and wally are bots. First, I have a lot of experience with software of other kinds, so I have some sense of the typical ways software fails, as opposed to the typical foibles of real people. For one example among many I could give, I would expect a human idiot to have a lot more trouble operating a computer than he seems to have; with software, on the other hand, one is not particularly surprised at odd mixtures of competence and incompetence. Second, over time there have been several entities posting here that very clearly were bots, without any possible doubt. For some of them, it was evident not so much in what they had to say, but in the typography. For example, for one of them, every "content" word, i.e. any word other than common conjunctions, prepositions, articles etc, was enclosed in quotation marks, and if I remember correctly capitalized. For others, the typography was fine, but the content was so severely deficient both semantically and syntactically that such a person, if it was a person, would be utterly unable to operate a computer. One, long ago, struck me as a probable schizophrenic at the time, because of the word-salad character of its utterances, but in retrospect was almost certainly a bot. I look at it as an informal Turing Test. Entities posting here might only be trying to convince others that they are people, but might actually be software. How can one decide?

MS is not even in the same ballpark of demanding control when compared with Apple. They have certainly had issues, but they develop and deliver a functional and capable API, development toolset, and still continue to dominate the desktop market in the enterprise. Linux is great, but hasn't got anywhere near the numbers of capable individuals who can provide support, development, and network integration. Microsoft seems to be stepping up and setting the standard with premium hardware which will allow the OS to perform as designed. Many hardware manufacturers and OEMs have cut corners to sell cheaper products, which MS has taken hits for over the years. With a premium example hardware line, these faults will now more likely be directed where they belong. MS can then focus more on the actual software issues.</Msg><Username>Bill_Meister</Username><Timestamp>1344381569000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 19:19:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344382025000-105</Id><Title>If the Military was pro-Obama</Title><Msg>He wouldn't be suing Ohio.
