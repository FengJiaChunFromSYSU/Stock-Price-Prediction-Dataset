You're not making it with what the meaning of "is" is, you can't even start. Willard Mitt Romney has claimed employment status with Bain Capital in 2010 to run this particular tax scam. That makes his employment a fact under the law unless he wants to repudiate that and pay, along with Bain Capital, the associated penalties. His prior tax returns would show that he was doing exactly the same thing during his tenure as Governor of the Commonwealth, something that would present him with serious legal liabilities and a significant number of them. The reasons for that may escape you, but there will be ample evidence that Willard Mitt Romney was in fact the first wholly owned subsidiary of Bain Capital Inc. to have served as Governor. He'd like to extend that service to the Presidency. We know how your "anecdotes" clearly illustrate your lack of any point, but your "work" is failing to make much of a dent in Romney's problems as well as illustrating that you project your own ignorance of business and finance onto others while you pursue your career of twelve to sixteen hour posting sessions on this backwater financial message board. You should reflect a moment longer on your "personal experience" anecdote while we have a bit of a good laugh at your expense.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345891416000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 06:43:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345895062000-13</Id><Topic><Title>Obama partly to blame for Empire murder?</Title><Username>hawcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1345863151000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 22:52:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you examined them a bit more carefully you'd scry out the following: Mitt Romney directly profited from the extraction of funds from GST Steel in the process of depleting its retirement accounts and leaving its pensioner health care accounts empty; a financial fraud that left the U.S. Pension Guarantee Corporation with the need to partially provide for the contractual obligations Mitt Romney defaulted on with taxpayers funds. Whatever you're babbling about the President of the United States, on the other hand, has nothing to do with reality.

You keep trying to distract from the fact that Mitt Romney has stated very clearly that he remained in Bain Capital's employ until at least 2010. Your lack of any understanding of business, finance and the law has always been obvious in this forum as well as your lack of any of the many other areas of "expertise" you expound on in the course of your all-day, every-day POLITICAL OPINION posting sessions.

You analogy has flaws, first buyers do not 'leave' after a purchase in the market, they stay in exactly the same state they were in prior to their last purchase. The low volume thing is no longer relevant now that algorithmic trading is the rule. Low volume indicates nothing more than indecision on the part of trading algorithms, as the market becomes more efficient in the economic sense this would be expected. Your hypothesis that low volume somehow indicates nobody is watching therefore allowing prices to be pushed is not nearly as true now that computer algorithms are the traders as they never cease looking for opportunities ( every ms ).

We’ve got to have a civilian national security force that’s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.” (emphasis mine) What sounded absurd in 2008 might not be so crazy in 2012. In a piece I found at the Daily Caller today, Major General Jerry Curry, US Army (Ret.) asks the question, “who does the government intend to shoot?” The question isn’t without some substance when you consider these facts from his article: The Social Security Administration (SSA) confirms that it is purchasing 174 thousand rounds of hollow point bullets to be delivered to 41 locations in major cities across the U.S. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has ordered 46,000 rounds of hollow point ammunition. These “small” purchases could be considered an anomaly if not for some seriously troubling numbers from America’s “Big Brother” arm of the government, the Department of Homeland Security. In March, DHS ordered 750 million rounds of hollow point ammunition. It then turned around and ordered an additional 750 million rounds of miscellaneous bullets including some that are capable of penetrating walls. This is enough ammunition to empty five rounds into the body of every living American citizen. Advertisement Privacy | Remove AdsParticularly troubling about these ammunition purchases is the type of bullets these agencies are preparing to use. According to the Major General’s article. . . Hollow point bullets are so lethal that the Geneva Convention does not allow their use on the battle field in time of war. Hollow point bullets don’t just stop or hurt people, they penetrate the body, spread out, fragment and cause maximum damage to the body’s organs. Death often follows.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1345926363000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 16:26:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345926406000-82</Id><Topic><Title>Gotta read this-(MSFT)</Title><Username>sherioqwgz638604</Username><Timestamp>1345907638000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 11:13:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm subscribed.

Seems like a lot of backpeddling to me. You analogy has flaws, first buyers do not 'leave' after a purchase in the market, they stay in exactly the same state they were in prior to their last purchase. The low volume thing is no longer relevant now that algorithmic trading is the rule. Low volume indicates nothing more than indecision on the part of trading algorithms, as the market becomes more efficient in the economic sense this would be expected. Your hypothesis that low volume somehow indicates nobody is watching therefore allowing prices to be pushed is not nearly as true now that computer algorithms are the traders as they never cease looking for opportunities ( every ms ).

In 1827, Joseph Smith began translating the golden plates using what he claimed as the "gift of God." Three years later, the Book of Mormon was published. In that same year (1830), Smith organized The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and became its first president. He continued to claim receipt of various prophecies and revelations, earning him the title "The Prophet" until his death in 1844 when he was arrested for treason and murdered by a mob....&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;... Joseph Smith's writings are the foundation of Mormonism (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). The influences from the occult, Shakers, Quakers, Seekers, teachings of William Miller which formed the basis of the Seventh Day Adventist church, as well as Jewish cabalistic traditions and the Masonic order can all be found throughout Smith's writings. Most of these came out of the nineteenth century religious environment of western New York during his lifetime....&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;... In 1833, ten years before Joseph Smith's death and three years after the publication of the Book of Mormon, the Smith family men were described in an affidavit signed by several prominent citizens of Manchester, New York, as "lazy, indolent, intemperate, destitute of moral character and addicted to vicious habits." ...&gt;&gt;</Msg><Username>migrationisahumanright</Username><Timestamp>1345936991000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 19:23:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345937071000-98</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA RUINED OUR COUNTRY.

"... Mitt Romney's problem of his own making, perhaps a clue might be Mitt's declaration of his occupation as being "executive", just as his occupation has been for the years after his alleged 2002 "retirement" that he recently backdated to 1999. In fact, Mitt is still a Bain Capital executive receiving his compensation in restricted stock that he launders through his wife's "blind trust". So it's not me who you should get your undies in a bunch over, since it's much more likely that Mitt "let the veil slip" a bit by disclosing that through the year 2010 he was occupied as an executive and gave quite clear indication of the scheme he's used for many years to convert his pay into long term capital gains to cheat the government out of taxes he owes..."

In 2010, the spinning wheel stopped with the "Queen Ann I" trust under the pointer. Bain Capital Partners X is the vehicle through which CLear Channel was taken private in 2009 when its exclusively hate radio content model wasn't cutting it for a public company. The "partnership" and its various tentacles obviously survive and prove useful both for broadcasting the gospel of Mitt as well as funnelling money into Mitt's always soon to be retroactive retirement accounts. In the Bain Capital Partners X LLC and LP corporate pair, the scam is repeated, but with slightly greater opacity (Mitt's running for office, for Pete's sake) so the underlying of the options that Mitt has received through the "services' he's rendered at a zero strike and converted to "fair value" at zero dollars to push through his wife's "blind trust". Just as in the CC stripdown, there's no way for Mitt to "lose" anything in the process of sucking whatever former "industrial titan" dry, but at least in the CC scam, Mitt was throwing hate yackers into the wood chipper instead of steelworkers or medical diagnostic testing developers. That doesn't make Mitt anything less of a continuing Bain Capital principal, and not exactly as unconflicted in his financial interests as he had indicated to the FEC or even the MEC. more from the bored here: http://messages.finance.yahoo.com/Stocks_%28A_to_Z%29/Stocks_M/threadview?m=tm&amp;bn=12004&amp;tid=1801094&amp;mid=1801094&amp;tof=17&amp;rt=2&amp;frt=2&amp;off=1 messages.finance.yahoo.com/Stocks_%28A_to_Z%29/Stocks_M/threadview?m=tm&amp;bn=12004&amp;tid=1801094&amp;mid=1801094&amp;tof=17&amp;rt=2&amp;frt=2&amp;off=1</Msg><Username>hellasmusic</Username><Timestamp>1345938077000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 19:41:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345938129000-102</Id><Topic><Title>Mitt maybe going to jail...</Title><Username>hellasmusic</Username><Timestamp>1345937511000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 19:31:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;&gt;Sounds like a felon..
