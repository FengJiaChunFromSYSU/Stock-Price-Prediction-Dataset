Morgan....</Title><Msg>Wait around at your peril for that oft-traditional May selloff, say J.P. Morgan Cazenove strategists. Back in April, they predicted there would be no May/June correction (aka ‘Sell in May and go away’), and they stuck to that on Tuesday: It’s been some month so far. The S&amp;P 500, up more than 4%, has knocked out several records in May and keeps trekking past that 1,600 landmark. Some even say we’ll see 1,900 by year end, though it’s got others nervous. Yet ‘Sell in May and go away’ deems investors make their money between November and April, sell at the beginning of May, stick it in cash and then come back in autumn. So why should we stop stressing? Four reasons, says J.P. Morgan: 1.The commodity selloff is not a “zero-sum game,” but rather a positive for global growth. “We think it will end up being interpreted as increased purchasing power, rather than raising the specter of deflation.” 2.The U.S. will not repeat the full “double-dip scare” of the prior three years. The big difference this time around compared with the summers of 2010-12 is that house prices are moving up, while jobless claims are moving lower. Some of the big tail-risks have also eased, and U.S. consumer de-leveraging looks mostly done, with the household debt-to-net-wealth ratio below trendline now. 3.Technicals aren’t being stretched. Hedge-fund beta is negative and investors expectations for a correction are up — “a good contrarian signal, in our view.” 4.The periphery — those troubled euro-zone countries — are pretty stable this time around. Thanks to the ECB, the there is no sign of the demon of the past — perhipheral bonds threatening to fall into a vicious spiral of ever-increasing yields. Peripheral spreads should keep tightening.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367928076701</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 08:01:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367928186318-24</Id><Topic><Title>4 reasons why ‘Sell in May’ won’t happen: J.P.

Quoting: "When Nokia (NOK) abandoned its own operating system (Symbian) in favor of WP, it was (probably) under the expectation that Microsoft (MSFT) would offer its users unique advantages of owning multiple Microsoft products. For instance, an effective WP ecosystem would make it more attractive to buy a Lumia phone if one already had W8 on the computer and subscribed to Office 365. "However, at this point, one has to conclude that Nokia's expectations haven't been completely fulfilled. Windows Phone simply isn't as big of a success as expected. So that brings us to the question of whether Nokia and Microsoft can turn the tide and significantly increase the WP market share. While there are many variables to analyze in an assessment of Nokia's future, I will only focus on the impact that the ecosystem will have on Nokia in this article."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367934418570</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:46:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367934446361-36</Id><Title>Wallstreet hated this stock at 26 but loves it at 33.</Title><Msg>lol, go back and read all the bullsheet.. how windows will fail. blah blah blah... be carefull however since they love it now could mean they want you to buy so they can dump.</Msg><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1367934446361</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:47:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367934665967-37</Id><Title>Ballmer Feels Heat From Windows 8 Performance</Title><Msg>Google it...</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367934665967</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:51:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367934827955-38</Id><Title>Ballmer sells 100 million copies of Windows 8</Title><Msg>beat that wotopimp</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367934827955</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:53:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367934863003-39</Id><Topic><Title>$34, time for a short?</Title><Username>jackjones367</Username><Timestamp>1367931971446</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:06:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some longs have the impression that MSFT is going to Hit the 40 Mark....34 Mark can be a bad Short....by the way CNBC on MSFT this morning...the have no idea why is going up so much....Mineral Spirits I say...lol... gl JB.</Msg><Username>jbspectrum</Username><Timestamp>1367934863003</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:54:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367934899202-40</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Prepares U-Turn on Windows 8</Title><Username>low_mac</Username><Timestamp>1367924863561</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 07:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It will be better I OS for all devices that is the same.

Using a variety of technologies, NASA/JPL created its new BeAMartian Web site. The site provides entertaining and engaging ways to view and interact with information delivered by Mars-based rovers and orbiters. The goal is to let the public participate in exploration, making contributions to data processing and analysis. It also provides a platform that lets developers collaborate with NASA on solutions that can help scientists analyze vast amounts of information that can be used to understand the universe and support future space exploration. Following extensive research, NASA/JPL launched a new Web site called BeAMartian that is designed to attract “citizen-scientists” to Mars exploration activities. The site was built using a variety of technologies, including the cloud-based Windows Azure platform, Silverlight, a cross-platform Web browser plug-in that delivers rich content and interactivity, and Windows Azure Marketplace DataMarket, a service that lets developers and organizations create and consume applications and content on the Azure platform.

Don't buy a new machine if you want it to be exactly like the last it is simple. The overwhelming majority of users like it as is. You don't dumb down an operating system for illiterate people. The changes have already started and will roll out slowly. The start button is already available by third parties if you want that. However the main screen with the tiles is the start screen.

According to the Perry administration, the formula for that kind of success IS simple, as is demonstrated by Texas' thriving economy.

You will love the change so much you won't be able to put it down. It is my favorite operating system out of everything and I have everything Google Android, Apple, etc. I never picked my Apple device up from the week Windows 8 came out. I honestly looked around to see where it is just know and I have no idea. I bought a Nokia Lumia and the Apple stayed at home 1 week later. Direct X makes Windows 8 run faster and the start time is almost immediate no several minute boot time. The look is so modern and reading the new and surfing is modern &amp; fresh. The flicking of the touch screen makes everything you used to do twice as fast. If you are holding down the scroll bar to go down the page that is pretty slow. The apps are fantastic. If you do not know there is an app for basically anything you want. I got the CNN breaking news on my windows 8 phone and the lock screen. The Boston incident was there within 2 seconds of happening . It is amazing to be informed and important for investors. There are a large amount of apps for free and some have low fees. The Xbox music is fantastic. You will find songs re done different and better than you remember. I love the music. Putting live tiles for the programs you want on the start screen is great. The free cloud storage is fantastic for photos and transferring files from phone or work PC's. The Windows 8 Phone &amp; Windows 8 Laptops sync so good I do not even have to do anything. I set it up once and all my contacts, photos etc are updated automatically. The Windows 8 Phone, Windows 8 Touch Screen Laptop &amp; a pair of Wireless High Grade Speakers = A hell of a great experience. I do not know where my Apple device is and the google tablet is the worse pos I ever used.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1367947924866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:32:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367947994023-151</Id><Title>Back to normal - markets setting new all time highs....</Title><Msg>....and MSFT down 50 cents.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1367947994023</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:33:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367948321068-152</Id><Topic><Title>Don't Drink The Windows 8 coolaid.</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1367947924866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:32:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is posting here all you do for MS, or do you have other responsibilities there?</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1367948321068</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:38:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367948349104-153</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro pricing confirmed in Australia, $1099 for 128GB and $999 for 64GB....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367880698055</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 18:51:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who noodles? bet you don't know ... :haha: it seem you also not know who vote macbook as best window pc. bcuz it not who you say -- (how come it never what you say? always something different? hmmmmmm ...) from slate: Now comes a report that grinds a little salt into the PC industry’s wounds. Soluto, a cloud-based PC-services company that helps people manage and troubleshoot their computers, released its first PC purchasing guide for small businesses. The ratings are based on Soluto’s own huge data set on the performance of its users’ computers, including application crashes, boot times, and blue screens of death. The company focused solely on laptops running Windows, and came to a startling conclusion: “MacBook Pro is the best Windows PC on the market.” from ign: The PC vs Mac debate has continued unabated for years. But as Macs have grown in popularity, and Apple eventually provided an easy menthol for dual-booting with Boot Camp, the lines sometimes get a bit blurry. As mentioned by CNET, one analyst group even thinks the MacBook Pro provides the best Windows experience. from laptop: At LAPTOP, we review dozens and dozens of laptops each year, putting each and every model through a series of rigorous tests. From screen brightness and heat to speed and battery life, our writers and editors evaluate every aspect of a given system to arrive at a rating. This list of 4-star notebooks represents the best of the best in every category. Apple makes the quintessential ultraportable notebook even better by giving the MacBook Air faster performance and longer battery life. The 3rd Generation Intel Core i5-powered notebook now lasts for over 8 hours on a charge. what? none of those guys are who you said? ok, you consistent. have to be satisfied with that since you can't be right. :haha:</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367948349104</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:39:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367948715414-154</Id><Topic><Title>Why Nokia's Biggest Problem Is Microsoft</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367934418570</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 09:46:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you speaking cuneiform now? you know, operating system, or language, do you know, that you can't spell! car car car car car car car car car! what the black stuff in tire grooves? that wally! not smart enough to stay off of freeway!</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367948715414</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:45:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367949066372-155</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT will bring back Windows 7 and name it Windows Blue</Title><Username>everyloser99</Username><Timestamp>1367938629607</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:57:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no w7 tablet ever exist then? ;)</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367949066372</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:51:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367949206824-156</Id><Topic><Title>All Aboard for Bubbleville!</Title><Username>celtic70737</Username><Timestamp>1367935416609</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 10:03:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not know about dow curve shape but i see parabola in msft price for may 6/7! that count for anything? :-D</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367949206824</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:53:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367949263815-157</Id><Topic><Title>Don't Drink The Windows 8 coolaid.</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1367947924866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:32:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>As much as I like MSFT....

"Key aspects" of how the software is used will be changed when Microsoft releases an updated version of the operating system this year, Tammy Reller, head of marketing and finance for the Windows business, said in an interview with the Financial Times. Referring to difficulties many users have had with mastering the software, she added: "The learning curve is definitely real." Analysts warned that changing course would be a significant admission of failure for Steve Ballmer, chief executive, who called the October launch of Windows 8 a "bet-the-company" moment as Microsoft sought to respond to the success of Apple's iPad. ----------------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1367955580226</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 15:39:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367955591544-182</Id><Topic><Title>Don't Drink The Windows 8 coolaid.</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1367947924866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 13:32:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go to hell or back to your Apple fan boy board whichever, they are both hell I guess.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1367955591544</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 15:39:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367955755617-183</Id><Topic><Title>This has been short selling and covering all day....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367955152217</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 15:32:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL - what a dope.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1367955755617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 15:42:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367955756550-184</Id><Topic><Title>For the 'hawcraper' moe: East Coast to be overrun by billions of cicadas</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367942984528</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 12:09:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All the training, 100% was done while Clinton was chasing skirts, moe, that is known.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367955756550</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 15:42:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367955828484-185</Id><Title>Qualcomm Says Tablet sales down 45% (ipads) &amp; PC sales only down 6%</Title><Msg>I guess CNBC missed the big news.

Why? Becuse they are the most violent, and like much of their neurosis they always project their distasteful behaviors onto others, (see Freud’s Theory of Projection) especially Conservative Republicans. The Democrat Party is the party of slavery, they are heirs to the philosophy of Kings, Dictators and Tyrants. If you go to the Democrat Party website they do not talk about their history before the 1920s. Now they are the party of assassins and mass murders. It is the history that you don’t know that is the key here… and although we can not predict future events by any historic measure, in this case, the Progressive, Liberals or Democrats have been pretty consistant in producing these destructive people and regiems. Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, and the Kennedys were all assassinated by registered Democrats. I recently received a viral email on this subject. It inspired me to jot down this blog post. It was about the last string of mass murders that the Democrats and their sycophant media have been trying to blame on the Tea Party or Right wing Radio Talk Show Hosts. Here is an excerpt from that email. Ft Hood Shooter: Reg­istered Democrat and Muslim. Columbine Shooters: Too young to vote … both families were Registered Democrats and progressive liberals. Virginia Tech shooter: Wrote hate mail to President Bush and to his staff. Registered Democrat. Colorado theater shooter: Registered Democrat, staff worker on the Obama campaign, occu­py wall street participant .. progressive liberal. Connecticut school (Sandy Hook) shooter: Registered Democrat. Hated Christians. Common thread is that all of these shooters were progressive liberal Democrats. Curious, isn’t it? So I was thinking, maybe we should just make registered Democrats also register to buy guns. Problem solved. I think that is a fair compromise. After all. it is for the children too.

On The Silicon Valley Business Journal... ------------------------------------------------------------- Sales of traditional computers are expected to fall 10 percent over the next four years, as consumers gradually migrate to tablets and other touchscreen devices. That’s the latest prediction from analysts at the NPD Group, which published its Quarterly Mobile PC Shipment and Forecast report on Monday. NPD analysts believe the industry will sell 203.3 million traditional desktop and laptop computers this year. They say that number will decline to 183.3 million PCs in 2017. Meanwhile, sales of tablets will only grow. The analysts said computer makers would probably end the year selling 256.5 million tablet computers. That number is expected to grow to 579.4 million tablets by 2017. “The rapid rise and establishment of white box tablet PCs (tablets made by small local brands, mainly in China) is putting pressure on traditional notebook PCs,” Senior NPD Analyst Richard Shim said in a statement. “These low-cost tablets are reaching further into emerging regions where notebook PC penetration rates have remained low, resulting in cannibalization by tablet PCs.” Despite that growing competition, Apple has managed to consolidate much of the premium tablet market, selling 19.5 million iPads in its most recent quarter. ------------------------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1367967134578</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 18:52:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367967319293-242</Id><Topic><Title>Financial Times: M$ admits success on the windowe 8 operating system</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367962860055</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 17:41:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Absolutely as I don't know of anyone who does not like the Security, Speed, SkyDrive, Skype, Audio/Video and all the 130,000 "SECURE" Apps that come with the Desktop Windows 8....

The 2-year-old mobile messaging and VoIP service, developed by Viber Media, announced the new stat Tuesday, saying that it has 200 million members spread across 193 countries. The company also revealed Viber Desktop for free calling and messaging on PCs and Macs. Viber, which specializes in mobile apps for iOS, Android, and most other operating systems, lets people use their mobile numbers in place of usernames and allows for free calls and multimedia messages over cellular or Wi-Fi connections. Viber Desktop carries the once mobile-only experience over to PCs and Macs, and introduces desktop-to-desktop video calls. The service's iOS and Android apps were also refreshed Tuesday to allow for a hiccup-free experience when switching between mobile and desktop. The redesigned apps also come with video messages, additional stickers, and support for more languages. Viber now supports 27 languages in total. Viber joins Facebook, WhatsApp, Kik, and others in disrupting the messaging market with over-the-top offerings that eat into carrier profits. WhatsApp suggested last month that it was beyond the 200 million user threshold. Viber, now with a striking presence on the desktop, also looks like a formidable challenger to more entrenched VoIP calling providers such as Microsoft-owned Skype, which has more than 280 million users. ----------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1367968399981</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 19:13:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367969097626-247</Id><Title>Hillary was either responsible for Benghazi or she was irresponsible, no other choices</Title><Msg>And now finally tomorrow we get to hear the truth perhaps.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367969097626</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 19:24:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367969384298-248</Id><Title>Google under investigation for Tax Fraud in Euroup (Source Reuters)</Title><Msg>Folks looks like Google claims they are not doing any business in Europe, but are making a lot of cash somehow!

In one sense correct, and they will do it to each and every one of us unless those empowered by 10 times as much money funding as should be needed to protect us, do their jobs. Hillary failed.

In December 2011, Microsoft announced that the Office 365 platform was now compliant with the ISO/IEC 27001 security standards, the European Union's Data Protection Directive (through the signing of model clauses), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for health care environments in the United States. At the same time, Microsoft also unveiled a new "Trust Center" portal, containing further information on its privacy policies and security practices for the service. In May 2012, Microsoft announced that Office 365 was now compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act: compliance with the act would now allow Office 365 to be used by U.S. government agencies. AND that is why DoD purchased nearly $700.00 million worth of Windows-8 licenses back in Jan 2013.
