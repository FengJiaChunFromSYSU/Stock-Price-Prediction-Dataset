Samsung has pushed back the launch of its Knox security software for Galaxy Android smartphones until summer, according to a New York Times report that claims more testing is needed before Knox finds its way into people’s hands. The setback is reportedly due to Samsung needing more time to test the software internally. Rigorous carrier testing was also cited as a delaying factor. Carrier compatibility testing can take months, and is one of the major reasons why the Android platform remains so fragmented.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367158552197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 10:15:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367160274296-15</Id><Title>Windows 8's main target is Android....</Title><Msg>Which has over 75% market share and is doomed because of "fatal security flaws"....

This open source code and permissive licensing allows the software to be freely modified and distributed by device manufacturers, wireless carriers and enthusiast developers. Additionally, Android has a large community of developers writing applications ("apps") that extend the functionality of devices, written primarily in a customized version of the Java programming language. In October 2012, there were approximately 700,000 apps available for Android, and the estimated number of applications downloaded from Google Play, Android's primary app store, was 25 billion. Android had a worldwide smartphone market share of 75% during the third quarter of 2012, with 750 million devices activated in total and 1.5 million activations per day". SO while the Open Source is Androids main strength, it is also its main weakness as it allows major room for abuse, Malware and serious security flaws so that the Handset vendors have to invent their own security protocols.... This leaves the door open for major migration by Enterprise and Consumers to to Windows 8 as is evidenced by recent introduction of Windows 8 Mobility devices by Samsung and HTC aside from Nokia.... SO as the awareness level of Windows 8 security features becomes more evident, this would present a once in a lifetime boost for MSFT and Apps developers (some 2 million activations per day).</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367167154363</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 12:39:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367169225196-21</Id><Topic><Title>Skype will make MSFT the largest telecom on Earth</Title><Username>matterofmoney</Username><Timestamp>1367140051224</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 05:07:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just started using it.....seems incredibly complex and obtuse....is this the Microsoft touch at work?

Why ?!....</Title><Msg>We longs, all agree, that launching an aggressive marketing campaign is critically important and will have a decisive impact on W8, WP8 devices acceptance and obviously, Nokia and even MS future. This is how I try to explain to myself that very tepid marketing or as some believe complete lack of such. Here, in my opinion, are main reasons for purposeful delay : a) visible, early symptoms and farther advancement of aapl decline (over the hill effect) b) Android OS progressing saturation and spread of fragmentation, (mutant versions) c) Samsung reaching over saturation level with little room to grow (fatigue level) d) MS selling large enough number of W8 devices to create fertile environment for WP8 handsets demand (so money spent on marketing won’t miss a target ) e) extra time to test, correct and improve W8, WP8, critically important security features f) implementation of Win Blue and new Xbox soon g) implementing new Intel processors , Hassel and Atom in new line of Win 8 (Blue) devices. h) resolving parts supply chain issues i) to reach units production level which will fully satisfy the demand level Only then, after those conditions are met, starting a costly and aggressive marketing campaign makes sense and potentially large marketing /advertising funds wasted. Saying that I also want to stress that, there should be no excuse for almost complete lack of marketing or limiting it to minimum as we witness everywhere nowadays. Absolutly imperative is creation of a new and much better TV and other media, ads, for all age groups. Attractive and instructive ads showing great features in use, less “dancing on the head” tv commercials and Jessica Alba sitting and then walking with her WP8 phone. I welcome your opinions, because I consider this issue (lack of aggressive marketing ) as a central and decisive factor to, especially Nokia’s future but also although to lesser degree Microsoft’s.

In the meantime the death of the PC crowd had revved up its nonsense.... So we are six months into the Windows 8 launch and in two months will be releasing Windows Blue aka 8.1.... MSFT needs to drive the point home on Windows 8 Platform's "security features", on/off speed, audio/video qualities and newly being developed Apps and deal with Desktop vs Metro start screen which is quite simple to do.... WE really need to focus on Android's security flaws and above all Google's appetite to steal your personal info and read your emails so they can sell you short and make money.... I think the Scroogle video was a good start, but now they need to go after Android in conjunction with Samsung, HTC and others who use Android and that needs a lot of coordination and patience as MSFT does not want to alienate its downstream eco-system.

Notebook prices should soon hit $200, but most of those will be Android-based devices, not Windows 8, an Intel executive said. Intel CEO Paul Otellini last week said touchscreen PCs could debut at prices as low as $200 in the coming months. At the time, he didn't specify what operating system those products would run. But Dadi Perlmutter, Intel executive vice president and chief product officer, told CNET on Wednesday that notebooks priced at the $200 level will predominantly be Android products running on Intel's Atom mobile processor. Whether Windows 8 PCs hit that price largely depends on Microsoft, he said. "We have a good technology that enables a very cost-effective price point," Perlmutter said. The price of Windows 8 laptops "depends on how Microsoft prices Windows 8. It may be a slightly higher price point."</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1367187711480</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 18:21:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367189086686-53</Id><Topic><Title>Android notebooks?

Intel has been slow coming out with their new chips which are really essential for great win8 pro tablets. They are coming out in a month. Also later this year (Q4) Intel will have a chip for 4g lte phones. Intel has just been slow.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1367202147789</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 22:22:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367202227860-81</Id><Title>$200 bucks for an android laptop is $120 too much</Title><Msg>Android is fine for throw away devices.
