Yes, says Jay Hakes, who directed the independent U.S. Energy Information Administration for seven years during the Clinton administration. "From a statistical standpoint, to take one year out of three — one year is not indicative of a trend," he said. So we pulled the numbers from when George W. Bush was in office -- January 2001 to January 2009 -- as well as from when Obama was in office. In our chart, we’ve italicized the years he was in office and put in bold the years Obama led. • From 2004-08, well into Bush’s tenure, oil production on federal lands and waters fell in four of five years, for a net decrease of 16.8 percent. • From 2009-11, the Obama years, oil production rose two of three years, for a net increase of 10.6 percent.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1350482569569</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 10:02:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350482820044-46</Id><Title>Whisper is LOSSES coming FRI - MSFT will Miss earning and number</Title><Msg>strong sell coming win 8 very hard and not user friendly,,,, Big Industry very concerned.

That created the perception that Obama did well, because he was less laid back. But on the bread and butter issues, the economy and taxes, Romney wins.

If you want more time to get your message out in debates, it’s good to be a Democrat. According to the CNN debate clock, President Obama spoke at greater length than Mitt Romney during both debates, as did Vice President Biden during his debate with Paul Ryan. In the first debate, Obama spoke for 3 minutes, 14 seconds more than Romney — which means he got 8 percent more talking time than Romney. In last night’s debate, Obama spoke for 4 minutes and 18 seconds longer than Romney, giving him 11 percent more talking time. Obama talked for 52 percent of the time when either man had the floor, while Romney talked for 47 percent. During the vice presidential debate, the gap wasn’t as wide: Biden spoke for 1 minute, 22 seconds more than Ryan. Still, that gave Biden 3 percent more speaking time than Ryan.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350490943379</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:22:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350491044594-81</Id><Topic><Title>Perot Endorses Romney</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1350486215210</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:03:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Posted at 11:37 AM ET, 10/17/2012 Presidential debate: Libya questioner says Obama didn’t answer By Erik Wemple Kerry Ladka stood before President Obama at last night’s town hall-style debate and asked the question that would touch off an onstage verbal brawl and, later, an intense national discussion. Here’s how it went: Q: It’s Kerry, Kerry Ladka. PRESIDENT OBAMA: Great to see you here. Q: This question actually comes from a brain trust of my friends at Global Telecom Supply in Mineola yesterday. We were sitting around talking about Libya, and we were reading and became aware of reports that the State Department refused extra security for our embassy in Benghazi, Libya, prior to the attacks that killed four Americans. Who was it that denied enhanced security and why? Was Ladka satisfied with how the president responded? Simply no. “I really didn’t think he totally answered the question satisfactorily as far as I was concerned,” Ladka tells the Erik Wemple Blog. Jeez, what about the president’s response could possibly have disappointed Ladka? Was it the fact that he started out with a canned talking point, inserted, perhaps, in the hope that the audience will forget the question? Here’s the first part of Obama’s response: PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, let me, first of all, talk about our diplomats, because they serve all around the world and do an incredible job in a very dangerous situation. And these aren’t just representatives of the United States; they’re my representatives. I send them there, oftentimes into harm’s way. I know these folks, and I know their families. So nobody’s more concerned about their safety and security than I am. Or was it the next part of the president’s response, when he goes bureaucratic, explaining his three-pronged set of instructions to his staff? And since no response in a presidential debate is complete without an attack on your opponent, Obama was careful to then point out that Romney had politicized the tragedy in Benghazi. Now, Governor Romney had a very different response. While we were still dealing with our diplomats being threatened, Governor Romney put out a press release trying to make political points. And that’s not how a commander in chief operates. You don’t turn national security into a political issue, certainly not right when it’s happening. That was all by the way of not answering the question Ladka had placed before him. The president’s clear intent to sidestep Ladka’s inquiry might have prompted activist moderator Candy Crowley to say, Hey, how ‘bout an answer, Mr. President? She didn’t, and the conversation careened toward a clash over whether the president had given the country a timely admission that Benghazi was a terrorist attack. President Obama, though, wasn’t done with Kerry Ladka. “After the debate, the president came over to me and spent about two minutes with me privately,” says the 61-year-old Ladka, who works at Global Telecom Supply in Mineola, N.Y. According to Ladka, Obama gave him ”more information about why he delayed calling the attack a terorist attack.” For background, Obama did apparently lump Benghazi into a reference to “acts of terror” in a Sept. 12 Rose Garden address. However, he spent about two weeks holding off on using the full “terrorist” designation. The rationale for the delay, Obama explained to Ladka, was to make sure that the “intelligence he was acting on was real intelligence and not disinformation,” recalls Ladka. As to Ladka’s question about who turned down the Benghazi security requests and why, Obama reportedly told him that “releasing the individual names of anyone in the State Department would really put them at risk,” Ladka says. Obama’s retail politics left an impression on Ladka:”I appreciate his private answer more than his public answer,” he says. Spoken like a very genuine undecided voter, Ladka says he wasn’t impressed with Romney’s response to the Libya matter, either. “I like Obama very much but I am very impressed with Romney’s business background,” says Ladka, who’s not saying in which direction he's leaning. Didn’t someone out there say these debates make no difference?</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350491044594</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:24:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350491492950-82</Id><Topic><Title>Perot Endorses Romney</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1350486215210</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 11:03:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Miff Bombney is already a talking point parrot.

Housing starts increased 15 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 872,000 units, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. That was the quickest pace since July 2008, though data on starts is volatile and subject to substantial revisions. America's economy has shown signs of faster growth in recent months as the jobless rate has fallen and retail sales data has pointed to stronger consumer spending. Wednesday's data showed that housing, which was battered by the 2007-09 recession, is increasingly one of the brighter spots in the economy. "One of the big headwinds for the economy has been the weak housing market and this indicates that headwind has dissipated," said Gary Thayer, an economic strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis, Missouri.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1350492709420</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:51:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350493101676-87</Id><Topic><Title>Billy Graham supports Romney, do anything for his run for the presidency</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1350492616912</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:50:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama met with Billy three times for advice and never took it.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350493101676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:58:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350493192726-88</Id><Topic><Title>GREAT 10% POP TRADE</Title><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1350416154326</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 15:35:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice call #$%$ wipe LOLOLOLOL Nowhere near $30 - and won't be HAHAHAHA - what a #$%$ head!!!</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1350493192726</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:59:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350493270202-89</Id><Topic><Title>Billy Graham supports Romney, do anything for his run for the presidency</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1350492616912</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:50:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Senile old religican, founder of the American Taliban.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1350493270202</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:01:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350493323256-90</Id><Topic><Title>INTC BEAT, NOW UP 5%</Title><Username>squeezetracker</Username><Timestamp>1350417830305</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 16:03:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTC getting whacked- LOLOLOLOL What a freaking moronHAHAHAHAHAHAHS!!!!!1</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1350493323256</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 13:02:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350493342555-91</Id><Topic><Title>Billy Graham supports Romney, do anything for his run for the presidency</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1350492616912</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 12:50:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because the Kenyan is a Musllim and Billy Graham is a Christian.

Though the survey was taken before Obama's comparatively strong performance in Tuesday night's second debate, the survey shows that the White House is now Romney's to lose. The former Massachusetts governor's lead now stands at 51 percent to 45 percent among likely voters, up from a 50-46 percent figure on Tuesday. With just three weeks to go until the election Romney also leads for the first time in a month among all registered voters, the venerable polling group says. That figure is narrower with the Republican up by 48 percent to 46 percent.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350501712914</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 15:21:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350503294233-109</Id><Title>Another one of Obamma's Musllim tries to blow up Fed Reserve bank in NYC</Title><Msg>FBI sold him fake bomb material and arrested him.

[aka Halliburton] was selected for a no-bid contract worth as much as $568 million through 2011 for military support services in Iraq, the Army said.The Army announced its decision yesterday only hours after the Justice Department said it will pursue a lawsuit accusing the Houston-based company of taking kickbacks from two subcontractors on Iraq-related work. The Army also awarded the work to KBR over objections from members of Congress, who have pushed the Pentagon to seek bids for further logistics contracts. Is Dick Cheney secretly still in government? Or, is Halliburton one of the few contractors who can get the job done? Either Halliburton is the son of Satan, or the left was wrong in demonizing them in the first place. They can’t have it both ways. Either they were right, and Halliburton is evil incarnate and The One – their one - is supporting such evil; or they were wrong in the first place and should just shut up. Either way, they really should shut up. You're a steaming piece of Crap.... Aren't you???</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350527379256</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 22:29:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350527775604-151</Id><Topic><Title>Even CNNs Candy lying for Obama couldn't cover up his lies</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1350513508179</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-17 18:38:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Mitt Romney is now ahead 6 points in a national poll of 2700 registered voters with a +/- 2% error range.
