You probably listened to Fox News all of last year telling you that inflation was coming, to buy gold, short the dollar and U.S. equities. Your posts reveal that it is you who have, to use your own words, said "goodbye to your savings". I pity your situation. You cannot all by yourself posting at this little used message board create a wave that will ever rectify your obvious painful losses. You are wasting your time posting here. I am replying only because I feel sorry for you. I will ignore your future posts, but you can not drive up gold, drive down MSFT, drive down the dollar with your manic posting here. Turn off Fox for it is that skewed reality that ruined your portfolio. You are not alone. I have friends who took their lead from the manics at Fox and are in near ruins. Hating President Obama or loving him does has no place in investing. Ever. Blame Fox for your losses. You believed them. You should not have.</Msg><Username>roirop</Username><Timestamp>1364431879561</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-27 20:51:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1364431881869-74</Id><Title>Win 8 market share reached 4.2%</Title><Msg>News out today from Softpedia that Windows 8 finally reached market share of 4.1%.

If you or I were to win the lottery including a free vacation, both would be taxed as ordinary income. Obama is fond of bemoaning tax loopholes for the rich. Well this is an opportunity for him to close one of the most flagrant of them ... the Obama vacation loophole.

The fundamental philosophy of atheism is, "Everything is permitted; nothing is forbidden." The weird and perverse outcomes which liberals espouse flow directly from this worldview.
