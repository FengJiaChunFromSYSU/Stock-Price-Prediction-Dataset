I guarantee he wasn't lying as there is no reason to lie #1, and he is as honest as the day is long, #2. I guarantee you falsify the truth and distort it into your cause.And I will prove you wrong as always when you show the actual quote, all of what he said, not parts snipped out to mean something he did not say. the rose garden speech, for the hundredth time, says acts of terror, attackers, and in no way says demonstration. You can't make it not about benghazi because that was the reason for the speech, and what he talked about. You keep reaching for the 9/11 reference as something, but it was a side comment to the subject. You can't change the context, the subject, or the truth. He gave the rose garden speech specifically to address benghazi. There is no other side to it, none. This President does not lie, honest Abe II.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1368159893816</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 00:24:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368160089225-2</Id><Topic><Title>Laptop sales are down sequentially quarter over quarter as Surface Pro and Convertible Laptops are....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368123388575</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 14:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surface Pro is killing customers with hits ultra-high price tag.</Msg><Username>papa.weelee</Username><Timestamp>1368160089225</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 00:28:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368160150731-3</Id><Topic><Title>hawfeces your back, what happened, did an_obama_nation get banned</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1368151078246</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 21:57:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I support the new term for your posts, Feeces, all of them, "online fukery."

Nixon swore there was nothing to Watergate. If you ever tried to put out a fire in short dry grass on a hot day and in a slight breeze you know how it is. The flames remain low and you can stomp out a location with your foot but with the dry tender and the breeze as you move down the line putting out fire the embers and breeze re-ignite spots and the fire grows slowly. Obama boi focus on these points. (1) Rice was briefed with known lies and visited 5 Sunday talk shows spreading the official line lie. (2) The day after the incident Obama used carefully worded, scripted text in the Rose Garden to later fool dense. He said "terrorist attacks" while referring to the original 9/11, non native speakers were fooled (3) Three days after the incident, Obama, Hillary and Rice all told the other of a slain ex SEAL that it was a spontaneous demonstration protesting a video TO HER FACE. Now here is the point, there is a reason these lies were told. The reason may be less damaging than the lies but there is a reason, and Obama cannot tell us because to do so would admit the lying to the few dense dolts still defending the lies...so we must continue digging, until the reason for the lying is uncovered.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368181839200</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 06:30:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368182265349-17</Id><Title>At one point futures were up almost 70 points, does anyone actually still believe this pretend anxious</Title><Msg>buying is not manipulation?

Romney (his debate coaches were also fooled) and when Romney said Obama never mentioned terrorist in the 3rd debate, Obama made sure the commentator, Candy, made the point that terrorist was mentioned in the rose garden speech, winning that point clearly for Obama and making Romney look stupid. Criminals are really good liars and it takes overwhelming proof to find them out. The bottom line is nobody has connected Obama to Benghazi when he is the only one who could order a troop movement.

AS we can see, the Start Button removal in Windows 8 has become the lightening rod used by our detractors just to prove the point that change is impossible and PCs and Windows will rule the Enterprise space till the end of Time.... THE latest on the Enterprise front is that as CIOs want to cut cost and increase efficiency, DELL and HP Tablets and Convertible Laptops are replacing iPad at an "alarming rate" as they are the largest vendors of Hardware and Windows software to corporate clients.... THE next shoe to fall is switching to Windows-8 Phone which as Lenovo folks have pointed out, Android OS are infested with malware (Some even suggest that they come pre-installed with malware, kind of pre-hacked ready for sabotage and theft of personal/corporate data); the CIOs are pushing for a "consistent and seamless" OS across the corporate IT domain now that Cloud computing and security issues are becoming front and center.... SO folks the first victim on Phone wars will be Android OS followed by iPhone and the only reason that it may take a bit longer than Tablets/iPads is that DELL and HP do not have a Phone "to offer a more price competitive Hardware package", unless of course they develop one or team up with Nokia to stick it to AAPL.

They can also be accessed without you knowing it. Look at an app called hidden camera or something like that. That is sort of what is happening. That app can record video with the phone screen off and the camera light not on. So a hacker can turn on you video and watch you. They can also turn on your mic. Android phones are insanely unsafe. Anyone can alter the source code. That should be banned. Microsoft has namespaces and safeguard that make it a royal pain to get around. Most do not have that patience or skill.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Every day, all across the world, American diplomats and civilians work tirelessly to advance the interests and values of our nation. Often, they are away from their families. Sometimes, they brave great danger. Yesterday, four of these extraordinary Americans were killed in an attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi. Among those killed was our Ambassador, Chris Stevens, as well as Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith. We are still notifying the families of the others who were killed. And today, the American people stand united in holding the families of the four Americans in our thoughts and in our prayers. The United States condemns in the strongest terms this outrageous and shocking attack. We're working with the government of Libya to secure our diplomats. I've also directed my administration to increase our security at diplomatic posts around the world. And make no mistake, we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people. Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification to this type of senseless violence. None. The world must stand together to unequivocally reject these brutal acts. Already, many Libyans have joined us in doing so, and this attack will not break the bonds between the United States and Libya. Libyan security personnel fought back against the attackers alongside Americans. Libyans helped some of our diplomats find safety, and they carried Ambassador Stevens’s body to the hospital, where we tragically learned that he had died. It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi because it is a city that he helped to save. At the height of the Libyan revolution, Chris led our diplomatic post in Benghazi. With characteristic skill, courage, and resolve, he built partnerships with Libyan revolutionaries, and helped them as they planned to build a new Libya. When the Qaddafi regime came to an end, Chris was there to serve as our ambassador to the new Libya, and he worked tirelessly to support this young democracy, and I think both Secretary Clinton and I relied deeply on his knowledge of the situation on the ground there. He was a role model to all who worked with him and to the young diplomats who aspire to walk in his footsteps. Along with his colleagues, Chris died in a country that is still striving to emerge from the recent experience of war. Today, the loss of these four Americans is fresh, but our memories of them linger on. I have no doubt that their legacy will live on through the work that they did far from our shores and in the hearts of those who love them back home. Of course, yesterday was already a painful day for our nation as we marked the solemn memory of the 9/11 attacks. We mourned with the families who were lost on that day. I visited the graves of troops who made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan at the hallowed grounds of Arlington Cemetery, and had the opportunity to say thank you and visit some of our wounded warriors at Walter Reed. And then last night, we learned the news of this attack in Benghazi. As Americans, let us never, ever forget that our freedom is only sustained because there are people who are willing to fight for it, to stand up for it, and in some cases, lay down their lives for it. Our country is only as strong as the character of our people and the service of those both civilian and military who represent us around the globe. No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for. Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done. But we also know that the lives these Americans led stand in stark contrast to those of their attackers. These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity. They should give every American great pride in the country that they served, and the hope that our flag represents to people around the globe who also yearn to live in freedom and with dignity. We grieve with their families, but let us carry on their memory, and let us continue their work of seeking a stronger America and a better world for all of our children. Thank you. May God bless the memory of those we lost and may God bless the United States of America. END 10:48 A.M.

During the past six years, annualized dividend payments grew no less than 10% each year except for 2010, which has seen a growth of only 5.8%. But in the last couple of years, the annualized payout had increased by an average rate of a whooping 22.8%. How safe is the dividend? The company has a payout ratio based on cash flow of 20.2% and its free cash flow has been increasing since 2010. Both factors indicate its ability to pay the same if not increase dividends in the near future. Also, improvements in its core business can be observed as the net operating cash flow continues to grow at double-digit rates. The increase was 26% in 2010, 12% in 2011, and 17% in 2012. In fact, one analyst has calculated that the company’s core operating cash flow, where non-cash adjustments in its cash flow statement are eliminated, grew by 21% and was higher than what rivals Google, Apple, and BlackBerry have had in the past year. Also, Microsoft continues to show its profitability prowess; its profit margin is almost back in the 30% range based on its performance in the last quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013. Together with the robust revenue performance, this had brought the company to surpass earnings estimates in the two most recent quarters.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368198961714</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 11:16:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368198979078-95</Id><Topic><Title>"Doomed Operating System ($MSFT)"</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368196803143</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 10:40:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BTW I know what he means by "brutal customer service" from Microsoft.

White House emails reviewed by ABC News suggest the edits were made with extensive input from the State Department. The edits included requests from the State Department that references to the Al Qaeda-affiliated group Ansar al-Sharia be deleted as well references to CIA warnings {to the administration} about terrorist threats in Benghazi {that were ignored} in the months preceding the attack. That directly contradicts what White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said about the talking points in November. “The White House and the State Department have made clear that the single adjustment that was made to those talking points by either of those two institutions were changing the word ‘consulate’ to ‘diplomatic facility’ because ‘consulate’ was inaccurate,” Carney told reporters at the White House press briefing on November 28, 2012.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1368201489501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 11:58:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368201601572-124</Id><Topic><Title>WHY Windows will win this round as well....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368147359000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 20:55:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this comment inappropriate! you not allowed to be contestant and judge contest too! :haha:</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368201601572</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:00:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368201964409-125</Id><Topic><Title>ABC News: Administration Lied About Not Contriving the Benghazi Fairy Tale</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1368201489501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 11:58:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Within hours of the initial attack, the State Department sent out two alerts. The first, at 4:05 p.m., indicated that the compound was under attack; the second, at 6:08 p.m., indicated that Ansar al Sharia, an al Qaeda-linked terrorist group operating in Libya, had claimed credit for the attack. The story from Obama, Hillary and Rice that went on for months about it all being a protest about an offensive on-line film was an intentional lie. "What difference does it make" asks Hillary and maybe many low information kooks out there? The administration was warned by the CIA about the terrorists before the strike and did nothing. The embassy pleaded for additional security - they were denied. When the terrorists attacked, Obama went to bed, and the administration did nothing. They HAD to cover up their incompetence. Thanks to the good guys that are willing to trek into the darkness to find and testify to the truth.

The ACLU's complaint notes that only two percent of the hundreds of millions of Android handsets on the market today are running the most recent version of Android. The majority of handsets run a version released in the last two years, but nearly half of all Android users are running software older than that. This fragmentation of the Android market has led to many users being locked out from some software offerings, such as Facebook Home. It has also led to no small level of discontent within the developer community, with some predicting that independent developers will be squeezed out due to their inability to develop across so many version numbers.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368202405609</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 12:13:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368202657695-128</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft says Yammer sales up 259%, added 312 customers in quarter....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368188028400</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 08:13:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IN fact this is the next Big offering by MSFT to large organizations and governments....

The main greenhouse gas blamed for global warming averaged 400.03 parts per million at a monitoring station on Hawaii’s Mauna Loa volcano yesterday, according to data published today on the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration website. The administration’s data stretches back to 1958. The reading is considered a landmark by scientists and environmentalists, who say carbon emissions caused by burning fossil fuels are warming the planet and must be reined in before they cause irreversible changes to weather, sea levels and Arctic ice cover. “We are in the process of creating a prehistoric climate that humans have no evolutionary experience of,” Bob Ward, policy director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics said in a telephone interview. The last time CO2 levels were this high was at least 3 million years ago, he said. Then, “temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius higher than pre-industrial times, the polar ice caps were much smaller, and sea levels were about 20 meters (66 feet) higher than today,” he said. ********************************************************************************************** BELIEVE THE SCIENCE OR BELIEVE THE KOCH BROS, THEIR SHILLS ON THIS BOARD AND THE HOUSE MEMBERS IN THEIR POCKETS.

There are a plethora of different things going on. From the US Gov &amp; Military concerned about spying &amp; hacking, id theft and other odd happenings like 100's of thousands of clicks redirected to google ad sense pages and generating 100's of millions of dollars in phony ad clicks. That means someone allows other peoples ads to be delivered to their own web site and they get paid and google get's paid by the advertisers whose ad words account ads are displayed. The likely hood of figuring out how to bypass googles security for click fraud and malware detection without internal previous or current knowledge from the inside of google is slim to none. Google says Russian &amp; Chinese organized crime controls it. I have ad words and ad sense. If you even click your own ads one time they shut it off. These people have figured out how to hit a page 100's of thousand times without being detected. You cannot do what they are doing without some internal experience in google its software, safeguards and policies on detecting fraud accounts. You don't just learn how to hack Linux and be able to know their extensive security policies to prevent even minor click fraud. That part of it is just too hard to do and to blame it on some organized crime outfits is iffy. We are not talking about just redirecting a hit.

I have no knowledge that it is being done internally, I just do not know how it can happen being a programmer and a little familiar with their policies.

The FBI is not putting out warnings on Microsoft only Android. I have said that all of this almost sounds like some message board BS. It is not, they are really investigating and making accusations. I think it is crazy every single time this comes up. The Microsoft Phones are hard as hell to hack. I was originally doing Silverlight programming which used XAP files. You cannot visit a website and have your Microsoft Phone infected, etc. Documentation I have read says can only install a xap app via the sdmicro card on the phone if you do not go through the Microsoft Store. That does not sound correct to me, but I have not had a chance to play around with it yet. Most of the phones do not even have an SD micro card. Luckily I have one to experiment with. You cannot get any malware through their system and you cannot alter source code. I am working on ways to get legitimate apps on the phones via xap files without going through the Windows Store for businesses. Windows Phone &amp; Android are just so far on different ends of the security measuring stick they cannot be compared.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368210400665</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 14:26:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368210403877-170</Id><Topic><Title>Bloomberg: Greenhouse Gases Hit Threshold Unseen in 3 Million Years</Title><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1368208415564</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 13:53:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess I missed something in the thread re Andrew and peers but nevertheless I suspect you missed somethingas well.

Current sea-level rise potentially affects human populations (e.g., those living in coastal regions and on islands)[2] and the natural environment (e.g., marine ecosystems).[3] Between 1870 and 2004, global average sea levels rose 195 mm (7.7 in).[4] From 1950 to 2009, measurements show an average annual rise in sea level of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm per year, with satellite data showing a rise of 3.3 ± 0.4 mm per year from 1993 to 2009,[5] a faster rate of increase than previously estimated.[6] It is unclear whether the increased rate reflects an increase in the underlying long-term trend.[7] Two main factors contributed to observed sea level rise.[8] The first is thermal expansion: as ocean water warms, it expands.[9] The second is from the contribution of land-based ice due to increased melting. The major store of water on land is found in glaciers and ice sheets. Sea level rise is one of several lines of evidence that support the view that the climate has recently warmed.[10] It is very likely that human-induced (anthropogenic) warming contributed to the sea level rise observed in the latter half of the 20th century.[11] Sea level rise is expected to continue for centuries.[12] In 2007, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that during the 21st century, sea level will rise another 18 to 59 cm (7.1 to 23 in), but these numbers do not include "uncertainties in climate-carbon cycle feedbacks nor do they include the full effects of changes in ice sheet flow".[13] More recent projections assessed by the US National Research Council (2010)[14] suggest possible sea level rise over the 21st century of between 56 and 200 cm (22 and 79 in).</Msg><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1368212943515</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 15:09:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368213188148-179</Id><Title>Will MSFT ever go up?</Title><Msg>will this pig EVER have an up day? what happens when the markets start having down days? this pig will get CRUSHED , that's what</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1368213188148</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 15:13:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368213259714-180</Id><Topic><Title>ABC News: Administration Lied About Not Contriving the Benghazi Fairy Tale</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1368201489501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 11:58:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The 4 Americans were allowed to be murdered rather than bring in support because the Administration along with the State Dept's knowledge, and top Military officials were supplying the Muslim Brotherhood with Arms" Is that the MBA group for short? yeah that's what hapened all right, mmm hmmm.

That filmmaker remains jailed on a parole violation, continuing to serve as a scapegoat for the failings of the Obama administration. Meanwhile, the perpetrators of the Benghazi attack run free and presumably plan new attacks against America, either overseas or here at home.

Quoting: "Global handset manufacturer, Nokia Corporation (NOK), introduced Asha 501, the first from its new Asha smartphone platform. The company is targeting the entry level smartphone customers who want to upgrade their phones. "Asha 501 happens to be the first smartphone to be built on the new Asha platform, which is an open standard platform and allows any developer to create and upload mobile applications. The new smartphone possesses many high-end features like a 4GB memory card, Wi-Fi facility, a 3.2 megapixel camera and is preloaded with social networking sites. However, the 3 inch screen is smaller than most smartphones and it does not support 3G networks. "Significantly, Nokia has introduced two new features namely Home and Fastlane in the smartphone. Home is a standardised application grid used for launching individual apps while Fastlane keeps track of the recently accessed contacts, social networks and applications used by the user. "Asha 501 is designed to simplify smartphone usage and comes at a low price of $99. The phone is expected to be shipped from Jun 2013 and is likely to be available through 60 operators and distributors spread across 90 countries." ________________________________________ I like the part about allowing any developer to create and upload mobile applications...</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368218386236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:39:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368218885336-205</Id><Topic><Title>Nokia Extends Asha Family</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368218386236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:39:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah...windoze phone has failed Nokia.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368218885336</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:48:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368218924161-206</Id><Topic><Title>Boston Replacing M$ Exchange With Google Apps</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368218371092</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:39:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like Microsoft's moat is beginning to silt up...</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368218924161</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:48:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368219157827-207</Id><Topic><Title>Nokia Extends Asha Family</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368218386236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:39:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That has nothing to do with Microsoft Windows 8 Phone. Nokia Asha is just Nokia no connection to Microsoft and that phone is a very low end 2g phone for developing markets. Windows 8 does not let any developer to upload mobile applications. Windows 7 used Silverlight which is xap. Windows 8 is different xaml but still uses xap files to deploy. I just happened to get into the Silverlight developing when it first came out so I am way ahead of the game on the xap files and deployment. It would take someone months to a year to be able to figure all of the stuff involved in Windows 8 phone development and deployment. It is hard stuff not like creating a web site. You can actually use html/java to build Windows 8 apps now. So it is easy. I am just saying the deploying and creating xap files and knowing how to get them onto the phone is a major project. Hacking W8 phone will never ever in a million years get to the point of Android. Those guys cannot figure it out and even if there are isolated problem it will never be like 60% infected with Malware which is what I heard about Android. That Asha probably is just as bad. That has nothing to do with Microsoft though. Maybe take the Asha phone being unsecure over to the nuts on the Nokia board. Microsoft Windows 8 phones are safe as you can get. Nothing is ever fool proof but it is not a freaking cluster F like Android.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368219157827</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:52:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368219211492-208</Id><Topic><Title>Nokia Extends Asha Family</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368218386236</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:39:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm trying to learn more about the Asha platform.

Someone listening in fell asleep while eavesdropping and started snoring. I than realized it was real. I also have been able to demo a phone taking video and recording with the screen off and camera off. Even if you had it in your hand you would not know it was recording. Unless it happens to you, most people will not believe it or care. Apple has had problems also and that is a closed system.

In a statement to Dow Jones Business News, Google spokesman Matt Kallman said: "This is the same tactic we've seen time and again from Microsoft. Instead of building great new products, Microsoft attacks the competition, and tries to drive up the prices of Android devices for consumers." 'No case has ever been successfully made for any of Microsoft's undisclosed patents that are being used to profit from Android, but that's not what is important for businesses. The bottom line is that it's usually cheaper to pay off patent trolls than it is to fight them in court. Whether Microsoft's publicly undisclosed patents are valid or have any relevance to Android is beside the point. 'That's why Motorola Mobility's patent lawsuit against Microsoft is anything but done. In today's legal climate, the biggest companies use patents to battle over market share and patent licensing. Nokia, Microsoft, and Oracle's attempt to knock Android out of the European Union market as "a below-cost Trojan horse", is simply another tactic in their legal attempts to win profits from a market where Microsoft is unable to compete with its products.'</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368220441900</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 17:14:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368220515249-215</Id><Topic><Title>Boston Replacing M$ Exchange With Google Apps</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368218371092</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 16:39:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When they start getting sued after someone steals info with address and pictures and commits some type of crime.

Looking at her searches, looking at her messages. He can see her texts. If you think it is a joke, it is not. If a small company did what google is doing they would be in pull ups in the county joint. It is basically too big to prosecute. What do investigators do when they get to the campus. They will be awe struck and they will be met by professionals and then what do they do. They do not know where to go, how to look in the system. Google is going to just act professional and they will all smile and shake hands. It is like the banks "too big to fail". Google will be "too big to prosecute". The campus is just too impressive and it makes them look like they own the world. They probably will get a slap on the wrist and a pep talk.

The current version is no better. LOL. Google has had the NSA "work" their phones and make them safe for the NSA to use. However, that is not the way it works for public phones. In 2010 google tried to make a deal with NSA to find the wholes in their own system or at least make it a good show that they were trying to deal with the problem. The current version is still being exploited. It would be good to have it updated if they can do it without crashing the phones completely. I am not sure why they think it is safer. No one including google has been able to find the ongoing holes. It needs to be scrapped. They will never ever be able to secure a Linux based phone. You can ask the NSA to look into it, but they cannot be there every minute. The Pentagon etc, are using 3rd party IT security firms to try and enlighten them what to do. In all fairness to Google they do not have an easy solution here. They did not create Linux or it's variants. They are under attack 24/7 from every country in the world. This is not going to be a solve able problem. It is just going to be kicking the can down the road. Let's see how long before Facebook Home has problems. It is scary that all these kids are using Facebook Home running Android.

That is because the code is not all the same. They can just write brand new stuff and keep fooling it. So the ACLU is suing the carriers to force an upgrade that is a little safer but NOT SAFE. #$%$?

ANYONE who thinks software is just a mathematical formula and can not be protected is dishonest to the core.... There are many ways to "design" a software from structural viewpoint that make one software faster, easier to use and more secure, otherwise no one will innovate and any ruling to alter the current status quo will have disastrous implications....

The next morning, he went out and told the nation about the terrorist attack on BenGhazi, you think so or not. That pops your balloon on the so called cover up, because he already said it was acts of terror. Nothing to cover up. He did not say spontaneous demonstrations. 10,000 dollars to your paypal account if you can prove he said s.d. in the rose garden speech. Andrea is not evidence, again it is still opinion. Next the emerging emails. They need to be fuly verified and investigated before a conclusion about any mistake. Who has not changed wording in emails sent? There were a bunch of people involved, all trying to say the right thing, and that's all it was. It doesn't matter what it is called, Americans were killed. Call it boys out for a lark, the deed has been done already, the name is not what is important. What is important is what the President stated so eloquently in the Rose Garden speech, what we must do, and who we are. It's detrimental to the nation's security to not allow officials to do what they think best at the time, in real time. Name how they like, change the name how they like, it is not good to help terrorists know what is up. Sorry if your excited little pre parade is rained on.

"We don't see Android happening in the commercial market," said Iris Sepulveda, sales and marketing manager for PR Computer Services. "I think most customers right now on the corporate side are choosing between Apple and Windows."
