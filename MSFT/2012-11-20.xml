The results were devastating for Microsoft (MSFT) and non-Apple PC makers. They were excellent, meanwhile, for Apple (AAPL). Byron Acohido wrote up the results for USA Today and filmed a short video with charts. You can watch that here. In the meantime, here are the key points: The survey covered 135,000 Windows users split across three versions of the operating system: Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. Only a very small percentage of users--9%--said they were going to accelerate a purchase of a new computer because of Windows 8. Overall, 16% of those surveyed said they planned to buy a new computer Of these folks, a staggering 42% said they plan to buy an Apple product--either a Mac or an iPad. Most of the Apple buyers (30% of the total buyers) planned to buy an iPad, suggesting that some of these planned purchases are motivated by the desire to buy a tablet. (Maybe Microsoft can save some of these with strong sales of the Surface.) The rest of the switchers, 12%, planned to buy a Mac.</Msg><Username>mashiach</Username><Timestamp>1353416794750</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 08:06:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353417628047-6</Id><Title>What Seeking Alpha does not say......</Title><Msg>is allmost everyone of those tablets run windows software.

If you ever want to have half a prayer of selling this ludicrous tale of subterfuge there is one thing you will have to explain. Flight 77 took off from Dulles that morning at 8:20 AM. This is not disputed. According to the official manifest there were 58 passengers (including the hijackers) and 6 crew on board. This is not disputed. The aircraft's path after takeoff was tracked both by radar and by on board transponders so that it's exact location and heading were known precisely at all times. This is not disputed. Neither the aircraft nor any of the people on board have ever been seen or heard from again. This is not disputed. So, WHERE is the plane and WHERE are all those people? Their relatives would certainly like to know, I'm sure. Even after the plane descended below radar the transponders were still supplying altitude and heading data. Where did the plane and people go after the radar and transponders showed the aircraft turning around, approaching and then descending into D.C.? Until you can answer that question you will never sell this bogus claptrap to a single soul that has an IQ above 50. Only conspiracy theory simpletons that refuse to consider ALL the facts would swallow this #$%$ without raising that question and having it answered.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1353420086320</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 09:01:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353420721251-12</Id><Topic><Title>Nokia "smartphone" is worst on the market.</Title><Username>daytradejoe</Username><Timestamp>1353366027677</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 18:00:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Get your head out of your behind" "all you nok haters" "two idiots, evil balmer and eflop" Interesting choice of nyms you made.

"W8 got pummeled by analysts who cited it a a major factor in tepid PC growth". No surprise. Go into any computer store and look at the reaction customers have looking at new PC's without touch. They don't like what they see and they leave the store empty handed. But it's worse than they realize. In addition to the absence of the W7 Start Menu there's also no support for POP3 email or movie DVD's. Instead MS gives you cloud-login so they mine your personal data, they force you into their cloud so they can stream data to your apps and then they push paid adds to the OS you paid dearly for. No wonder consumers are walking out of the computer store without a PC.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1353421642967</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 09:27:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353421666278-14</Id><Title>MSFT &amp; mobile apps search play MIMV.

From this mornings 10-Q: Mimvi has initiated several development, marketing and engineering efforts with Microsoft Corp. that we expect will combine Mimvi's proprietary search and discovery technology with Microsoft's Azure Cloud platform, Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 product lines - including Microsoft Surface tablets and other devices. The first of these initiatives is the development of "Mimvi Mobile App Search" for Windows Phone 8, a mobile app that enables Microsoft consumers to search, discover and receive recommendations for mobile apps, mobile content, and mobile products. In addition, Microsoft and Mimvi are jointly promoting the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform in hosting and delivery services for mobile apps. Below are screenshots of Mimvi Mobile App Search which the Company expects to release in late November. Mimvi is also working with other groups within Microsoft to develop search, discovery, recommendation and social media technologies for applications on a wider range of Microsoft products and platforms. This collaboration we believe will help other developers migrate their solutions to the Microsoft Phone 8 and Windows Azure platforms opening up their applications to run on over 400 million Microsoft desktops and tablets worldwide.</Msg><Username>cashflow599</Username><Timestamp>1353421666278</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 09:27:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353422135308-15</Id><Title>24.45 is my target get me some microsoft shares.</Title><Msg>yeah I love me some microsoft.</Msg><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1353422135308</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 09:35:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353422179542-16</Id><Topic><Title>I love Linux!</Title><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1353259366462</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-11-18 12:22:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Mac is Linux BSD linux backend" That's some of the stupidest, most uninformed tripe I've ever read.

On one side, we've heard Steve Ballmer publicly tout early adoption of the operating system. On the other, the rumor mill claims sales aren't looking so hot, and Microsoft really isn't happy. So, which is it? The folks at ReadWriteWeb have found a tie breaker: Merle McIntosh, Newegg's Product Management chief for North America. McIntosh spoke to the site on record, and his take seems to lend weight to the rumor mongers. See for yourself: "On the software side it has been slow going, and I think it will be that way until the pricing normalizes sometime next year," McIntosh said, declining to provide actual sales numbers. "But on the hardware side, we're starting to see some slow but steady increases in notebooks, and as the tablets become available, we're starting to see some good sides of the tablet part of the equation as well." To be entirely fair, Ballmer was touting early adoption from enthusiasts—and I expect most PC enthusiasts bought their Windows 8 upgrades straight from Microsoft, not in retail-boxed form at Newegg. Buying direct from Microsoft isn't just quicker; it's cheaper, too: $39.99 instead of $69.99 for a retail copy. Nevertheless, McIntosh says Newegg and its partners planned for an "explosion" at the Windows 8 launch, despite internal doubts about just show successful Windows 8 would prove internally. "[Windows 8] did not explode, as I think you know, coming out of the gate," says McIntosh. McIntosh seems enthusiastic about Windows 8. It's just a matter of patience. His take: we'll have to wait until next Spring before the new operating system "really gets some momentum."</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1353425375874</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 10:29:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353425549815-37</Id><Topic><Title>Analysts remain positive on Windows 8 prospects</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1353424575704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 10:16:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I plan to buy the new INTC powered Surface when it comes out.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1353425549815</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 10:32:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353425554550-38</Id><Topic><Title>Analysts Turn Negative On Windows 8 Prospects</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1353421642967</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 09:27:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>phands still running around half the day with a mouth full of spunk can barely find time to post</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1353425554550</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 10:32:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353425632290-39</Id><Topic><Title>911 Pentagon</Title><Username>cyber_critiquer</Username><Timestamp>1353375504129</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 20:38:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think the post is to ridicule the ignorant stories about Benghazi, the President not saying what he did say, they said, she said , why this why that, blah blah blah, etc, etc?

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- For all of its radically redesigned features -- and in part because of them -- Microsoft's Windows 8 won't be an instant success. The latest update to the world's most popular operating system goes on sale Friday. Microsoft has high expectations: CEO Steve Ballmer said in July that he expects Windows 8 to kick off "the most epic year in Microsoft's history." Steve Sinofsky, Microsoft's Windows chief and heir apparent to Ballmer, speaks of "reimagining Windows" to create "a new PC experience." Windows 8 may be the operating system of the future, helping Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500) make up for past mistakes that left it well behind chief rivals Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) and Google (GOOG, Fortune 500), especially in the mobile computing field. But for the near future, all signs point to buyers taking a wait-and-see approach. The vast majority of Windows sales come from new PCs, and both Wall Street and industry analysts think that PC sales in the fourth quarter will be very weak. Intel (INTC, Fortune 500) said last week that it expects holiday PC sales to grow at half their usual seasonal rate. The industry doesn't expect Windows 8 to jump-start PC demand. Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa thinks it will have "no effect" on sales. New Windows releases sometimes motivate consumers with aging PCs to upgrade, but that's unlikely this time around. Those with older machines running Windows XP, Vista or 7 are still expected to wait on the sidelines, despite Microsoft's ultra-low, $40 Windows 8 upgrade offer. The main reason: For the first time since Windows 95, there will be a learning curve associated with the new version of Windows. It has a radically redesigned user interface and a series of new, gesture-based commands for interacting with apps. On a touchscreen device like a tablet, it's pretty intuitive, but with a mouse and keyboard, it can be awkward. The completely different look and feel could turn off some buyers. "Consumers going into the store for a PC will be shocked and possibly disoriented by what they discover on the shelves," said Michael Silver, analyst with Gartner. "Users hate change, and won't embrace a new user interface without at least a basic sales pitch. Consumers may be forced to accept it, but they will be more critical and more likely to find fault with the approach." That goes for business customers too, who will require training, says Vijay Rakesh, an analyst with Sterne Agee. Many corporate customers, which typically skip versions of Windows, won't be using Windows 8 at all. The majority upgraded to Windows 7 over the past few years and could choose to simply wait for Microsoft's next release. "Windows 8 stands a very real chance of gaining only limited uptake in corporate environments," said Silver. "The drastic changes in Windows 8 leads us to predict that most organizations will be hesitant to deploy it broadly, especially to users that won't have hardware that takes advantage of touch." Related story: Microsoft's Steve Ballmer may have to watch his back Gartner expects Windows 8's launch to be much weaker than Windows 7's, even though Windows 8 is launching during the holiday season. (Windows 7 went on sale in July.) Next year is expected to be slow as well: Gartner anticipates sales of the new operating system coming in 6% lower than the first full year of Windows 7 sales. Here's another kicker: Windows 8 won't end Windows 7's strong run. A year after Windows 7 went on sale, the previous version -- Vista, Microsoft's biggest disaster -- sold on just 53 million new PCs. But there will be 168 million new Windows 7 PCs sold next year, Gartner forecasts. Windows 8 is not expected to significantly disrupt Windows 7 sales until 2014. "Adoption is going to be slow," said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research. "Microsoft is making appropriate, significant changes to Windows, but it's going to be challenging for customers to embrace it wholeheartedly. It will be a rough year -- not just a rough quarter -- for Windows 8." Microsoft's giant marketing machine missed an opportunity to get the positive message out early about Windows 8, Gillett thinks. The company hasn't advertised the new operating system ahead of its release, which Gillett said could have prepared users for the new look. As a result, it will take time for customers to digest just how radically different it is. Even if Windows 8 isn't an instant success, most analysts expect it to sell well over the long haul. Windows is the most ubiquitous operating system in the world, after all. But is this the operating system that will turn every kind of device into a PC, including tablets? That's what Microsoft is hoping. Faced with stiff competition from Apple and Google, though, Microsoft might have to wait until the next version of Windows to really make a dent. "Ultimately, Windows 8 will sell well," Gillett said. "But it won't blow the doors off."

The initial dispute came when Pres said the next day I said acts of terror in the rose garden, which is undeniably 100% TRUE, then romney got that gotcha look in his eye, and proceeded to make a fool of himself. The topic was not whether in the following weeks, blah blah blah, other words were used, which of course means nothing anyway outside of faux news hyping it up.

Anti-virus company Avast conducted a survey of Windows-based PC users the day before Windows 8 was released. The results were devastating for Microsoft (MSFT) and non-Apple PC makers. They were excellent, meanwhile, for Apple (AAPL). Byron Acohido wrote up the results for USA Today and filmed a short video with charts. You can watch that here. In the meantime, here are the key points: The survey covered 135,000 Windows users split across three versions of the operating system: Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. Only a very small percentage of users--9%--said they were going to accelerate a purchase of a new computer because of Windows 8. Overall, 16% of those surveyed said they planned to buy a new computer Of these folks, a staggering 42% said they plan to buy an Apple product--either a Mac or an iPad. Most of the Apple buyers (30% of the total buyers) planned to buy an iPad, suggesting that some of these planned purchases are motivated by the desire to buy a tablet. (Maybe Microsoft can save some of these with strong sales of the Surface.) The rest of the switchers, 12%, planned to buy a Mac.

That's not surprising, given the results of this survey. And the most ominous part of the survey is the implication that nearly a third of those who plan to buy a new computer plan to buy an iPad. Some of these purchases may be supplemental--the PC owners may keep their PCs--but they won't do anything to help the Wintel PC business.

I mean, you're such an experienced pilot and all.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1353441538928</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 14:58:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353441755545-93</Id><Topic><Title>Windows users jumping ship</Title><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1353428085015</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 11:14:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Actually Wintel is the only game in town" You mean besides fondling the alter boys, father_wally?</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1353441755545</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:02:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353443049867-94</Id><Title>It still is way too HIGH.</Title><Msg>Wat tll hits South around 20.</Msg><Username>verable1</Username><Timestamp>1353443049867</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:24:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353443437232-95</Id><Topic><Title>It still is way too HIGH.</Title><Username>verable1</Username><Timestamp>1353443049867</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:24:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only if you're a lowlife parasitic short.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1353443437232</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:30:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353445017071-96</Id><Title>COME ON PLEASE FURTHER NORTH.</Title><Msg>JERKS.</Msg><Username>verable1</Username><Timestamp>1353445017071</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 15:56:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353445313213-97</Id><Topic><Title>Pentagon</Title><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1353441335979</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 14:55:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YOU STUPID IDIOT..!!</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1353445313213</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 16:01:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353446579448-98</Id><Topic><Title>HTC Windows 8 Smartphone</Title><Username>stok1mom</Username><Timestamp>1353348457535</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-19 13:07:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Again, I purchased the Windows 8 HTC phone on Sunday.

In an interview with Readwrite, Merle McIntosh, senior VP of product management for online tech retailer NewEgg's North American division, described sales of Windows 8 as "slow going," though he declined to cite actual figures. According to McIntosh, NewEgg – one of North America's largest tech retailers, with around $2bn in annual sales – was hoping for an "explosion" of Windows 8 sales following its October 26 launch. That didn't happen, he said, though sales have been steadily improving. Even before Windows 8 launched, McIntosh said, there were many within NewEgg who didn't expect sales to pick up until well into 2013. McIntosh himself now expects the OS to start taking off somewhere around the second quarter. Unlike some retailers, however, NewEgg doesn't plan to discount the Windows 8 upgrade package for the all-important holiday shopping season, although it will offer deals on such items as TVs, digital cameras, and Android tablets. And Windows 8 tablets? Not so much. McIntosh said that so far, most of the devices NewEgg has sold with Windows 8 preinstalled have been traditional desktops and notebooks. What's more, McIntosh hinted that many of the PCs NewEgg sells during the holidays will likely be older models designed to run Windows 7. NewEgg bought up lots of the older kit from OEMs during August through October, he said, explaining that the retailer has "aggressive ambitions in market share." ===========================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1353452722407</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 18:05:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353454135896-112</Id><Title>NICE DIVIDEND.

Nighty night, nurse Dogface already has tucked you in with dreams of thinking more bad things to say about Obama tomorrow. Nice little project you have gotten into. Keeps you busy all day, huh? You're quite a guy, if crazy, but hey, geniuses are always crazy, right? Just think of that when they call you nuts, it's just you're a genius! Tell about this in group tomorrow morning before posting starts. Tell them you learned it at work, your message board engineering job. You're not nuts, you're a genius!! Like Einstein even!!
