Every week I put out a newsletter with new mentions as well as updates on held stocks. Here is this week's chart update on MSFT: MSFT generated a reversal week having made a new 4-week high and then closing in the red and on the lows of the week. Further downside with 28.32 as the minimum objective is expected to be seen this coming week. Nonetheless, based on the action seen the past couple of weeks, the drop down to the $25 that I had projected would happen has lost its high probability rating and likely needs a further breakdown of the index market to be accomplished. A drop down to 27.50 is still a decent to perhaps high probability but if the indexes reach the downside objectives mentioned in the newsletter this week (12700 in the DOW and 2873 in the NAZ) and the stock was able to stay above 27.76 (like at 28.32), consideration to taking profits (though small) should be done.</Msg><Username>luckyone581</Username><Timestamp>1352592347454</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 19:05:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352594131819-38</Id><Topic><Title>Rasmussen Poll Romney STILL Lead</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1352582628974</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 16:23:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Their polling base are white people who don't understand beyond what is told to them on Faux News. I've heard some amazing outrage on ObamaCare, etc and it is all false information. I don't really care now except man there are a lot of stupid people who voted for romney. Believing completely false information without checking for themselves. And not just romney did that. Just think, if romney hadn't been white he would have gotten zero electoral votes.

Lessons can be learned from the Cola Wars in the 1980s and 1990s, and if history does indeed repeat itself then there is room for more competition which will help the consumer by offering more choices. For Microsoft this launch is very exciting but also risky, but if successful will put them on the right course, especially when Apple and Samsung fight over patent issues. With Microsoft's dividend of 3%, I believe MSFT to be undervalued at $29.52 and fairly valued at $33.00 and would not be surprised if it reaches $37.00.</Msg><Username>davidanderson916</Username><Timestamp>1352605767458</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 22:49:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352607703968-43</Id><Topic><Title>More people may get jobs with Obama care in place</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1352603116255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 22:05:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why not add all the people currently denied insurance by the greedy packs of pirates that we call health insurance companies and exorbitant premiums they charge</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1352607703968</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 23:21:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352608106337-44</Id><Topic><Title>More people may get jobs with Obama care in place</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1352603116255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-10 22:05:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Premiums are a product of probabilities.
