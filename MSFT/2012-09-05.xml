Microsoft has been trying for a decade to diversify, but hasn't been able to repeat the coup that was Windows 95.

My guess is that it will stay that way until the ship is about to sink and the old management has jumped or been thrown overboard. That would be the time for the company to bet everything on some new venture. It's still trying to preserve Windows/Office in the way it approaches Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8, and that's just ugly. It won't really commit to something completely new until there is nothing else it can do.

He then taught at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years—as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004—teaching constitutional law. From April to October 1992, Obama directed Illinois's Project Vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African Americans in the state, leading Crain's Chicago Business to name Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be. In 1993, he joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. His law license became inactive in 2007. ..... Mitt Romney, on the other hand, continuously relied on taxpayer funded bailouts to ensure that his leveraged buy-out schemes would be profitable to him no matter how badly the target corporations were mismanaged, even to the point of leaving the taxpayer to foot the bills for bankruptcies that resulted from his predatory wealth extraction schemes.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1346842101015</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 06:48:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346843985094-19</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT performance</Title><Username>cris.chest</Username><Timestamp>1346654240482</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-03 02:37:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nokia placing a bet on Windows 8: Geoff Blaber, senior analyst at CCS Insight “This really is a make-or-break time for Nokia in terms of their Windows strategy and partnership with Microsoft. We saw the strategy announced in February 2011, and this time last year, Nokia did really well with its first round of Lumia products. But this will be the first time we’re seeing the official combination of Nokia and the Windows 8 platform. This is Nokia’s chance to show that they can differentiate from the competition. The big question is whether there is consumer appetite for another platform. Nokia and Microsoft have got a chicken-and-egg situation — they need a big commitment from carriers to push a Windows phone, but carriers are loathe to do that because consumer demand is far from certain.”</Msg><Username>tomsaga25</Username><Timestamp>1346843985094</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 07:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346847870852-20</Id><Title>Slow economy due to lack of demand</Title><Msg>I know the real reason for the slow economy is the impoverished consumer and the resulting lack of demand.

Apple has gone from holding zero LTE patents last year to having 318 filed away today. That's around five per cent of the world’s total, today, the Korea Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) told local news site The Chosun Ilbo. Cupertino apparently developed just 44 of those patents itself while the rest were bought from once-proud Nortel as it was broken up. The Rockstar Bidco consortium which Apple joined with EMC, Microsoft and others to bid for further Nortel patents owns a further 116 LTE patents, effectively bumping Apple’s number up in excess of 400. By comparison, Samsung has the largest share of the patents on the planet with 819 (12.7 per cent), while US patent firm InterDigital is second with 780 (12.1 per cent). "This shows that Apple has been taking strategic steps to acquire intellectual property to prepare for potential legal disputes before it launches its own LTE smartphones," a KIPO official told Chosun Ilbo. The report echoes claims in the Korean Times on Friday that Samsung – still smarting after its defeat to Apple in a Californian court last month – was readying a move to strike back at the fruity tech brand. It claims that Samsung confirmed it would “immediately sue” Apple if the Californian phone-maker releases an LTE device. With the iPhone 5 possibly set to sport such functionality when it is announced next week, we should find out sooner rather than later. However, patent expert Florian Mueller warned that the Korean electronics giant would do well to rethink its strategy, telling The Reg: “4G/LTE won't be Samsung's key to a free pass for infringement”. “I would strongly discourage Samsung from trying to use 4G/LTE-essential patents to shut down the iPhone 5,” he added in a blog post. “It won't improve Samsung's position. It will only make things worse, especially with antitrust regulators. In my view, the reasonable approach for Samsung would be to sue for FRAND royalties over its Standard Essential Patents, not injunctions.”</Msg><Username>patentsaddicted</Username><Timestamp>1346851268268</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 09:21:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346851349261-31</Id><Title>MEMO TO OBAMA:START PACKING!</Title><Msg>Michelle's list of things to do today: 1.

It isn't about letting the rich pay more, it is they don't get a tax cut they don't need like we, the consumers, do. Who is buying all the iphones, miff romney? Miff Romney pays less tax than 420 50k income citizens, using his own 14% rate and a 20% rate for someone with a 50k job. He gets special deductions, and likes them a lot apparently. Income tax isn't use tax. The revenue from it is based on, well, income. If you want to change topics and talk about how much govt services one miff uses compared to 420 citizens, first you need to extract medicare and social security out because miff pays like one person making his income. He pays more into ss up to the limit but he will get more at the end depending on the years. As for national defense, one miff costs the same as 420 citizens. One miff costs the same as all citizens. Police services, miff probably costs like 10 citizens. Plane flights, FAA use, fuel use roads use miff probably uses like 100 citizens worth. 50k citizens wouldn't get food stamps I don't think. Nothing wrong with helping people with food, according to Jeezus and me.and even marmans. The point was missed, income tax paid by you is not your personal account at the govt anymore, you pay in more than one 50k citizen because you make more. That's the rules, want to change them buy an island and make your own rules.

The influx of out-of-towners has sparked a crisis for the 26-year-old homeless mom and dozens of others like her. RELATED: FIRST LADY WOWS 'EM DURING DNC SPEECH Eager to cash in on the thousands streaming into town, many down-market motels have jacked up their rates, forcing the homeless families who had been living in them into the streets and emergency shelters. Ramsey’s home over the past three months had been a dingy, $200-a-week lodge. But she and her 4-year-old son and 2-year-old daughter were abruptly sent packing last week after the motel started charging $150 a night. “They kicked me and my kids out like we were trash,” said Ramsey, who found refuge at a church. The plight of Ramsey’s family and others like it are inflicting added pressure on a shelter system that’s already beyond capacity. LIVE COVERAGE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION In the shadows of its gleaming skyscrapers and plush green spaces, this banking hub is struggling to reign in a skyrocketing homeless population. Family homelessness shot up by nearly 40% in 2010, and another 20% in 2011, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Some of these families are able to afford rooms in extended stay motels thanks to a part-time job or support from family members. “These are folks who are on the edge of homelessness and they’re eking out an existence,” said Dale Mullenix, executive director of the Urban Ministry Center, a homeless services organization.

Eking out an existence is precisely what Belinda Cherry, 41, says she and her husband were doing — until the Dems came to town. With his salary as a part-time dishwasher, they had been able to afford a room at the Arlington Suites on South Tryon St., the same motel where Ramsey was bunking down. But after the hotel ratcheted up its rates, Cherry and her husband were left sleeping atop a cement loading dock outside an abandoned brick building. “I’m really #$%$ off,” said Cherry. “We were just now getting on our feet.” HOMELESS5N_1 copy James Keivom/New York Daily News Arlington Suites, where Belinda and Steven Cherry were staying before they had to leave.

The company is pushing the phone’s Pureview Camera, which features image stabilization and a floating lens which captures substantially more light than the competing smartphone cameras. The Lumia 920 will also be the first handset to ship with a wireless charging station. One of the native apps is called City Lens, which pulls up notifications in real time of surrounding restaurants and transit routes. The phone also features a 4.5-inch curved glass screen and ceramic side buttons. Don’t Miss: Major Drama: Is This Nokia’s Final Act? In order to support all this, the Lumia 920 is probably going to be expensive. The Lumia 820 is a lower-cost alternative with different hardware, like a smaller 4.3-inch screen, and no PureView camera. The 820 will still feature the City Lens augmented reality app, which is a major draw. Microsoft and Lumia are trying to get ahead of the curve this week before Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) big event on September 12, which is expected to unveil the new iPhone. The companies have stepped up their game with these new phones. Apple and Motorola (NYSE:MSI), which is holding an event on September 6, are going to have to ante up if they want to deny Nokia and Windows Phone 8 market share. With poor growth over the last three months, this is make or break for Nokia.....</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1346870628435</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:43:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346870629070-74</Id><Title>The 1% pay more than any other country</Title><Msg>David, I challenge you to find another country where the top 25% pay 73% of the federal tax - I believe it was CNN that did the research - they didn't find another country even close to those numbers, but hey I guess the top 25% won't be paying their "fair share" until they endorse their entire pay over to the gov't</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1346870629070</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 14:43:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346870753315-75</Id><Topic><Title>Debbie Wasserman Schultz caught in bald-faced lie</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1346850986083</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 09:16:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And what truth would that be?

And from that playbook, he has two basic strategies. One is to blame the supposed deregulation policies of the George W. Bush administration that Obama and his surrogates endlessly say “got us into this mess.” And the second is to hug former rivals Bill and Hillary Clinton as hard as he can and harken back to the prosperity and economic growth of the 1990s. But there is just one problem with this theme. The Obama campaign’s twin messages of bashing deregulation and embracing the Clinton years are inherently contradictory. He is telling Americans to, in essence, look at the ‘90s, but don’t look too closely. Or they might see that the ‘90s, perhaps even more than even the ‘80s, was a decade of deregulation. In a much-hyped new pro-Obama ad, Clinton warns that a Mitt Romney presidency would “go back to deregulation,” and we can expect Clinton to make similar claims in his prime speaking slot in the Democratic convention. The fact remains, however, that on financial regulation, Bill Clinton as president was actually more of a deregulator than Bush.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346899337506</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 22:42:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346899362400-114</Id><Title>Billy must be choking on the Obamanure he is putting out!</Title><Msg>!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1346899362400</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-05 22:42:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346899362764-115</Id><Title>Commie libs have one drunken lying womanizing murderous liar, Bill Clinton...</Title><Msg>..... defending another misogynistic lying blood thirsty anti American lying Marxist lying Musllim in the form of, el diablo, Hussein, the brain dead corpse man.
