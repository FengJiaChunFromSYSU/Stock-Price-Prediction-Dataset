Winphone8 300% growth</Title><Msg>Microsoft: Windows Phone sales up 300 percent Summary: The freshly introduced Windows Phone 8 platform is performing well according to Microsoft, as the company prepares to roll out an update to its Windows Phone 7 OS. By Ben Woods | November 29, 2012 -- 11:51 GMT (03:51 PST) 9 Comments 0 Votes inShare more + Sales of Windows Phone 8 handsets have taken off just one month after the devices were introduced, according to Microsoft. Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, told shareholders in a meeting on Wednesday that sales of Windows Phone-based handsets in the month since launch were 300-percent higher than the same period last year. Read this Windows Phone 8: A tour of the business features Read more However, Ballmer did not say exactly how many devices have been sold, and the earlier generation of Windows Phone handsets, running Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 7.5, have not sold particularly well. Analyst house Gartner estimates for the fourth quarter of 2011, Windows Phone sales were around 2.8 million. Should the platform see its fourth-quarter sales for 2012 remain 300-percent higher than those of 2011, Microsoft can expect to shift around 11 million devices. Microsoft also launched its first Windows 8-based tablet, the Surface, at the same time as Windows Phone 8, marking a move away from its traditional software-centric business model into one that sees it producing more of its own hardware. Following the release of the Surface RT, rumours circulated online speculating that Microsoft would follow with its own Windows Phone 8-based hardware. "Focusing on devices and services will impact how we run the company, how we develop new experiences and how we take products to market for both consumers and businesses. The work we have accomplished in the past year and the road map in front of us brings this to life," Ballmer told shareholders on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Microsoft also confirmed that it was working to make the Windows Phone 7.8 update available to existing handsets by "early 2013". Most notably, the update will introduce the resizable tiles found on the home screen.</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1354196849452</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 08:47:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354197448920-26</Id><Title>More Seeking Alpha Nonsense</Title><Msg>According to Seeking Alpha, MSFT is a long known 'Value Trap' that hasn't performed forever.

An example of the way courts utilize the Preamble is Ellis v. City of Grand Rapids.[18] Substantively, the case was about eminent domain. The City of Grand Rapids wanted to use eminent domain to force landowners to sell property in the city identified as "blighted", and convey the property to owners that would develop it in ostensibly beneficial ways: in this case, to St. Mary's Hospital, a Catholic organization. This area of substantive constitutional law is governed by the Fifth Amendment, which is understood to require that property acquired via eminent domain must be put to a "public use". In deciding whether the proposed project constituted a "public use", the court pointed to the Preamble's reference to "promot[ing] the general Welfare" as evidence that "[t]he health of the people was in the minds of our forefathers".[19] "[T]he concerted effort for renewal and expansion of hospital and medical care centers, as a part of our nation's system of hospitals, is as a public service and use within the highest meaning of such terms. Surely this is in accord with an objective of the United States Constitution: '* * * promote the general Welfare.'"[20] "Don't be fooled" We are not fooled by you. You are a message board troll (a particularly lame one), not a constitutional nor legal scholar by any stretch of the imagination, including your own.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1354204830724</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 11:00:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354204950722-58</Id><Topic><Title>Obeying the Constitution means you cannot take from one to better another</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1354155867148</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-28 21:24:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you keep saying redistribute like it is a bad word.

I ordered a Dell Mini 9 Netbook with Ubuntu Linux in 2008 after the Vista Fiasco. 2 years ago, I picked up a Dell Vostro 14 inch laptop with Ubuntu Linux. It cost less than $350 including shipping. it was one of the lowest priced laptops available at that time. Since then, I upgraded it to Linux Mint and it's more traditional desktop environment. Ubuntu switched to the Gnome 3/Unity interface to be more like a touch screen tablet. Unfortunately, this new graphical interface isn't very popular. Ubuntu dropped from #1 most popular Linux distro to third place, according to Distrowatch. That's why Linux Mint took the #1 spot instead. Microsoft could learn a few things from the mistakes Ubuntu made. Most users don't want a tablet interface on their desktop or laptop.</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1354211650911</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 12:54:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354212567835-83</Id><Title>Surface Pro - Starting at $899</Title><Msg>Just got the email.

You picked a convenient time to interject that nonsense, didn't you. Let's go back and pick up the thread with your original assertion, shall we? "Obeying the Constitution means you cannot take from one to better another. It is depriving a citizen of their property without due process, which is SPECIFICALLY prohibited by the Constitution. Don't be fooled, Communists like 'Tard Baldy hate the U.S. Constitution." You were profoundly in error with that. In juxtaposition, to illustrate just how ignorant you are regarding our constitution I posted: "An example of the way courts utilize the Preamble is Ellis v. City of Grand Rapids.[18] Substantively, the case was about eminent domain. The City of Grand Rapids wanted to use eminent domain to force landowners to sell property in the city identified as "blighted", and convey the property to owners that would develop it in ostensibly beneficial ways: in this case, to St. Mary's Hospital, a Catholic organization. This area of substantive constitutional law is governed by the Fifth Amendment, which is understood to require that property acquired via eminent domain must be put to a "public use". In deciding whether the proposed project constituted a "public use", the court pointed to the Preamble's reference to "promot[ing] the general Welfare" as evidence that "[t]he health of the people was in the minds of our forefathers".[19] "[T]he concerted effort for renewal and expansion of hospital and medical care centers, as a part of our nation's system of hospitals, is as a public service and use within the highest meaning of such terms. Surely this is in accord with an objective of the United States Constitution: '* * * promote the general Welfare.'"[20]" Your reaction was to abandon the thread and inject Mr. Obama in an attempt to escape your own words.

But some of those members who signed on, many of them years ago, have started to back away, apparently leaving him several votes shy of the majority he would need to block any tax increase. Mr. Norquist contends that every few years, several noisy Republicans say their support is squishy. Yet every time, he says proudly, the outcome is the same. According to Mr. Norquist, “It’s been 22 years since a Republican voted for a tax increase in this town.” But ask Republicans in Congress what they think of the pledge, and many of them say that while they still subscribe to a low-tax view of government, they resent being hamstrung by a piece of paper they signed well before they were elected. Some of them are even saying they want out. “I’m frankly not concerned about the Norquist pledge,” Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia said in mid-November. Senator John McCain said in November that “fewer and fewer people are signing this, quote, pledge.”</Msg><Username>rightwing_rethink</Username><Timestamp>1354218269733</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:44:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354218371263-109</Id><Topic><Title>O, my God, 40 millions of Windows 8 sold in the 1st month!!!!</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1354051035490</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 16:17:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can always tell a "short" by there comments...</Msg><Username>ggray1956</Username><Timestamp>1354218371263</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:46:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354218451597-110</Id><Title>Whats wrong?</Title><Msg>What's wrong with softy this time?</Msg><Username>ggray1956</Username><Timestamp>1354218451597</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:47:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354218565963-111</Id><Title>This is excellent hub for MSFT stock, your views and thoughts</Title><Msg>If your interested in understanding the working of MSFT stock through insight and analysis, visit and subscribe too, Vippennystocksite dotcom</Msg><Username>nero1847</Username><Timestamp>1354218565963</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:49:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354218717735-112</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft -try being STRAIGHT with customers</Title><Username>goaway_hank</Username><Timestamp>1354217421997</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:30:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Also -I wonder if microsoft is trying to increase revenue by offer to "repair" this error for $99,which is probably more money than they get for a win 8 license from manufacturers??</Msg><Username>goaway_hank</Username><Timestamp>1354218717735</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:51:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354219133824-113</Id><Topic><Title>O, my God, 40 millions of Windows 8 sold in the 1st month!!!!</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1354051035490</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 16:17:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Msft is such a great company and such a strong buy in your viewpoint why then has the Surface production been scaled back by half due to poor sales and why has the stock price been virtually unchanged for over 10 years?</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

According to one industry watcher, however, they should all be watching out for Microsoft (MSFT). Sizemore Capital’s Charles Sizemore writes in a contribution to NASDAQ that “Microsoft will ultimately muscle-out Apple as the leader in smartphones and tablets.” He says the war will be long and grueling, but Microsoft will ultimately pull ahead because Apple has no ”durable long-term advantages” to keep customers loyal. He also contends that “Apple’s insistence on controlling every aspect of both its software and hardware puts it at a disadvantage to a more flexible Microsoft.”</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1354219616989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 15:06:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354219897625-116</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT's growing 300% in phones, 400% in Tablets</Title><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1354185878444</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 05:44:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good post,the people I have talked with that have WIN phones really like them, BTW you really have Queen all upset LOL!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1354219897625</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 15:11:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354219995360-117</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT's growing 300% in phones, 400% in Tablets</Title><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1354185878444</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 05:44:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Upstream supply chain sees Surface RT orders cut by half Monica Chen, Taipei; Joseph Tsai, DIGITIMES [Wednesday 28 November 2012] The upstream supply chain of Microsoft's Surface RT has recently seen the tablet's orders reduced by half, and with other Windows RT-based tablet orders also seeing weak performance, sources from the upstream supply chain believe the new operating system may not perform as well as expected in the market. Microsoft originally expected to ship four million Surface RT devices by the end of 2012, but has recently reduced the orders by half to only two million units. Although Asustek Computer, Samsung Electronics and Dell have all launched Windows RT-based tablets, consumer demand for those devices is also weak. The sources also pointed out that Surface RT is also unlikely to achieve great performance in the upcoming quarter which may force Microsoft to bring out its Intel-based Surface Pro tablet earlier in December. The sources also noted that Microsoft may consider reducing its Surface Pro price to attract more consumers; however, such a decision may put the already awkward relationship between the software giant and notebook vendors in an even worse situation.</Msg><Username>A Yahoo!

U.S. taxpayers screwed</Title><Msg>most of America is suffering through one the worst economic downturns in U.S. history, the Obamas are living the high life at your expense. During 2011, U.S. taxpayers spent an astounding 1.4 billion dollars on the Obamas. Meanwhile, British taxpayers only spent 57.8 million dollars on the entire royal family. Does anyone else see something wrong with this picture? So where did the 1.4 billion dollars go? That money paid the salaries of their staff members, it paid for their transportation and housing costs, it paid for entertainment and vacations for the Obamas, and $102,000 was even spent on a "dog handler" for the family dog Bo. In his new book entitled "Presidential Perks Gone Royal: Your Taxes Are Being Used For Obama's Re-election", author Robert Keith Gray reveals some absolutely shocking details about the enormous amounts of U.S. taxpayer money that are being spent on the personal needs of the Obamas. At a time when the U.S. national debt is absolutely exploding this kind of outrageous spending is completely and totally inappropriate, but of course the mainstream media is not going to report on this because they don't want to do anything to put the Obamas in a bad light this close to the election.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1354224491612</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 16:28:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354225186720-138</Id><Topic><Title>1.4 billion spent on Obamas versus only 57.8 million spent on British royalty.

Someone can surf the web while waiting for a plane and if he needs to open up Visual Studio 12 and create some code to change the world and keep his company going he can. If a worker in the field wants to run the same programs on the network computer they can. Not an $899.00 tablet. It is an $899.00 portable computer that will create millions of new businesses now that people can run a business on the go. Anything they can do at the office they can do on a lightweight tablet/innovation on the go machine. The possibilities are endless unless you have a closed mind. There will be millions of side businesses started by people who can now juggle two jobs because they have thier office with them.

"We have sold 40 million Windows 8 licenses so far," said Tami Reller, the new head of the Windows division's business side, at the Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference. "The 40 million is roughly in line with Windows 7." Analysts on Wednesday put Reller's numbers into context, and tried to divine what she meant by "sold." "That's good, but not great," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst with Moor Insights &amp; Strategies, in an interview, implying that the debut of Windows 8 was not going to be enough, as some industry watchers had expected, to turn around the PC business. Still, Moorhead said the 40 million figure was impressive. "Think about that. When Windows 7 released, everyone was eager to get away from Vista," he said. "But you don't see people running to upgrade to Windows 8." Rob Helm, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft, agreed. "It looks like license sales are on par with Windows 7, at least," Helm said in an email Wednesday. "That's a good result given other signs of distress in the PC market." As Helm noted, PC sales have been flat or down year-over-year, due to continued economic issues and fierce competition for technology dollars from smartphones and especially tablets. But at the same time, Reller seemed to dial back early expectations for Windows 8, instead arguing for a long-haul look. "Windows 8 wasn't built for just any one single selling season," she said. "It really was built for the future, the future concept for the future. And so it will take a few selling seasons to get sort of all the designs we all like into the marketplace, all the apps that we want into the Store." Like Moorhead, Reller also noted the special circumstances around Windows 7, although she refused to utter the word "Vista," as if the name of that problem- and perception-plagued OS had been excised from the Microsoft lexicon. "I mean, if you think about the timing of Windows 7, there was a lot of anticipation. And you can sort of fill in the blanks on why there was such great anticipation for Windows 7, but there was," Reller said when asked to compare Windows 8's start with its predecessor's. Microsoft declined to elaborate on Reller's 40 million number, or define what licenses had been included in her tally. Analysts, however, were not so shy, noting that the count included licenses for PCs that have not yet been sold. "Microsoft recognizes licensing revenue as an OEM builds and ships [PCs] to a distribution point or to end customers," said Moorhead. In other words, machines that have been assembled and shipped, but not yet sold or deployed, would include licenses that Microsoft can legitimately count among the 40 million. Without sales figures from Microsoft's OEM partners, it is impossible to tell how many PCs with already purchased licenses are not yet in customers' hands.</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1354236147409</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 19:42:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354236312433-165</Id><Title>Microsoft sold 40 million W-8 licenses since W-8 brought out</Title><Msg>Microsoft: 40M Windows 8 licenses 'in line' with early Windows 7 sales Even so, exec urges taking the long view of Windows 8 By Gregg Keizer November 29, 2012 06:47 AM ET 30 Comments . . Computerworld - A senior Microsoft executive on Tuesday said the company has sold 40 million licenses for Windows 8, essentially matching the first month performance of Windows 7 in late 2009. "We have sold 40 million Windows 8 licenses so far," said Tami Reller, the new head of the Windows division's business side, at the Credit Suisse Annual Technology Conference. "The 40 million is roughly in line with Windows 7." Analysts on Wednesday put Reller's numbers into context, and tried to divine what she meant by "sold." "That's good, but not great," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst with Moor Insights &amp; Strategies, in an interview, implying that the debut of Windows 8 was not going to be enough, as some industry watchers had expected, to turn around the PC business. Windows 8 Windows 8 brings zero 'pop' to consumer PC sales Surface Pro tablet pricing starts at $899, Microsoft says Microsoft: 40M Windows 8 licenses 'in line' with early Windows 7 sales Mozilla mods Firefox to feature Microsoft's MSN Dell XPS 12 review: Does it succeed as both an ultrabook and a tablet? Windows 8's early uptake trumps Vista's Microsoft promises to support Surface RT for 4+ years Mozilla suspends work on 64-bit Firefox for Windows The new business model: Competing with partners! Windows 8 UI 'strategic mistake,' argues design guru Still, Moorhead said the 40 million figure was impressive. "Think about that. When Windows 7 released, everyone was eager to get away from Vista," he said. "But you don't see people running to upgrade to Windows 8." Rob Helm, an analyst with Directions on Microsoft, agreed. "It looks like license sales are on par with Windows 7, at least," Helm said in an email Wednesday. "That's a good result given other signs of distress in the PC market."</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1354236312433</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 19:45:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354236631279-166</Id><Topic><Title>We are now buying MSFT it on sell now</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1354217310619</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 14:28:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hah hah hah, Raystock is not buying msft and we hope that you are not buying his lie.
