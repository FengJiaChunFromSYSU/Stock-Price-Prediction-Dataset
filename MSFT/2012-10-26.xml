Americans vote. Yes people tend to vote in favor of similar backgrounds or interests. A doctor may likely vote for another doctor, a Chinese person another Chinese person, a european another european. When you go to a doctor do you look at the pictures and chose, as well as their education and experience? In other words what is your point and what are you complaining about now, people's right to chose and vote? Maybe if you had lived under jim crow or were spat on and called racial slurs your whole life, like some do here to black people, maybe when someone who is in your group, you would think that's about time, and it shows the racists are not right.

They also said they know he's responsible for the deaths of their sons and hope that he's brought to justice but that that probably won't happen until President Romney takes over. Read their statements, they are beyond angry at the Kenyan spy, they know why he didn't send in help and they know why he's trying to cover it up too. The Military, like the rest of America, hates and despises the anti American spawn of darkness commie Kenyan and not just because the Musllim's a piece of she it, but because he's e vill and he's destroying their country, the United States of America and he's murdering Americans with impunity and then covering it up by sealing all of the records of it.

Old PC's will feel dumb and clumsy. you'll probably feel embarrassed to have one. The Jumbo Tablet: Sony calls it the Vaio Tap 20, but it’s really a humongous tablet with a 20-inch diagonal touch-screen display. On its stand, it’s a nice all-in-one PC that tilts back to use like an easel. Removed from the stand, it runs on a battery and can be carried around the house or used to play digital board games. It starts at $880 and comes in black or white. The Ferris Wheel: The Dell XPS 12 is called a “Ferris wheel” design by Intel because of the way its display rotates. Dell calls it a “flip hinge touch-screen display.” Spin the screen, fold it flat and your laptop becomes a 12-inch tablet. It starts at $1,200. The Channel Slider: The touch-screen display on Toshiba’s Satellite U925T tilts back and slides forward in a channel, covering the keyboard and turning it into a 12.5-inch, widescreen tablet with an Intel Core i5 processor and 128 gigabytes of solid-state storage. It starts at $1,150. The Surf Slider: Sony also has a “channel slider” called the Vaio Duo 11, but it calls the convertible mechanism a “Surf Slider.” It starts at $1,100. The Tent: Lenovo has drawn kudos for its Yoga laptop with a 360-degree hinge that folds the display back until it becomes a tablet. You can also fold it around 300 degrees and pitch a “tent” that stands up by itself. A Windows 8 version with 13.3-inch screen starts at $1,099. An 11.6-inch version with the more-limited Windows RT software will start at $799 and arrive in December. Microsoft’s future may hinge on Windows 8, and your next computer may be all about the hinge.</Msg><Username>dscmsunw</Username><Timestamp>1351262203530</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 10:36:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351262716570-65</Id><Topic><Title>msft leads from behind...a method proven not to achieve above average growth</Title><Username>pelf_robot</Username><Timestamp>1351257327677</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:15:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perfect, it will help sales accelerate.

Ever wonder why it took ten years to catch up to MSFT market value? It could easily happen again, but with Google, Amazon, Apple, etc. much more competition makes it more of an even playing feild, so growth should steady.

Well it certainly seems to be just that on your part. We don't hear much about Farrakhan these days. There's a reason for that. Mr. Farrakhan was and is considered by most black Christians to be a dangerous extremist. While being welcome to attend or even to speak to congregations his views have been largely rejected outside of a small group of black Muslims. His marginalization due to those views has overcome the novelty of his emergence as a radical leader to diminish his influence to much the same level as yous, nil. You have a bad habit of generalization, one of the main failures of fallacious thinking. This is one that all narrow minded bigots suffer. You conflate an anomalous world view such as that of the odious (to most of us) Farrakhan with the view of an entire race consisting of mainstream black people. The resulting outlook and attitude has no value outside of your own imagination and produce zero contribution to the national conversation regarding which way we should go.

Those dead men weren't optimal for his bid to get reelected and that's why him, Hillary, Rice, Carney, Panetta and Holder watched them die in the situation room and then plotted and planned and came up with a cover up to cover themselves. This Nation has no president, just a blood thirsty anti American Kenyan spy, if it had an American president that was born in America he would have not only sent in armed drones to save those American men he would have also sent in F-16's along with the Marines and with every other branch of the military because that terrorist attack was an act of war on sovereign American soil. And there's not a person on the planet that doesn't know that the phony video excuse and cover up by Obamma was just that. Ps.

I think that's a closeout. Concerning Intel tablets, the Oct 1 news is that the Clover Trail Atom is delayed. Another news item is that the Clover Trail gets Ivy Bridge graphics before the end of the year. Then another news item is that Haswell is Intel's processor for convertibles and due in mid-2013. But Hawell is based on Ivy Bridge and probably around 14 watts power consumption. The Atom Clover Trail is 3 watts power consumption. In other words, for those who are not early adopters, this October 2012 release of Win 8 is a disaster. And then Win 7 is supported until the year 2020. So the computer makers might be making a mistake if they don't offer a choice of Win 7 or Win 8. I'm now thinking about a 3 pound laptop instead of a 2.2 pound laptop.

It is not new policy. Military history is rife with disasters caused by charging into situations blind and/or ill prepared. Lack of accurate intel regarding enemy strength or positions, weather conditions and predicted changes thereof, terrain features or whether mines/booby traps have been deployed by the opponent and where. The policy of preparedness is long standing. For a good example of what happens when a military force deviates significantly from this policy, search "Operation Eagle Claw" and what Delta Force commander, Colonel "Chargin' Charley" Beckwith ran up against.

Presidents have long used formal dinners to court foreign heads of state and to dish out fine food and wine to reward political, financial and show business celebrities and supporters. But current and former government officials said the documents obtained by The Examiner point to an unprecedented upsurge in White House spending on such events. The Obama extravaganza two years ago for Mexican President Felipe Calderon, which included a performance by pop star Beyonce, cost $969,793, or more than $4,700 per attendee, the documents show. The Calderon dinner was held on the South Lawn in a massive tent adorned with decorated walls, hanging chandeliers, carpeting and a stage for Beyonce's performance. Guests rode private trolley cars from the White House to the tent. Celebrity guest chef Rick Bayless from Chicago’s Topolobampo restaurant was imported to prepare Oaxacan black mole, black bean tamalon and grilled green beans. The dinner for the prime minister of India -- which was famously crashed by Virginia couple Michaele and Tareq Salahi -- cost nearly half a million dollars. Dinners for Chinese President Hu Jintao and British Prime Minister David Cameron were of the same level of extravagance. A knowledgeable government official who made the documents available to The Examiner said the extravagant spending seemed unfair with so many Americans out of work. "It just kind of takes your breath away to see the expenditure of money that has occurred since 2009," the official said. WALTERS Gary Walters, who ran presidential household operations for 21 years during Democratic and Republican administrations, before retiring in 2007, told The Examiner the costs reflected in the documents were "excessive. They are high." The chief usher of the White House from the Reagan to George W. Bush presidencies, Walters consulted a former White House colleague and said neither of them could recall entertainment costs anywhere near those revealed in the documents provided to The Examiner. "The highest [cost] event we could remember was $190,000 to $200,000 range, and that was for a very large dinner outside that was probably somewhere in the vicinity of 500 people with two different tents," Walters said, noting that the event was held under President Clinton. Data for state dinner costs under Bush were unavailable because he signed an executive order in 2001 that put all presidential documents under seal for five years after a chief executive leaves office. Spokesmen for the presidential libraries of Clinton and President George H.W. Bush were unable to locate data for dinners held in those years. State dinner costs are a closely guarded secret, the officials said, because of concern about offending governments whose dignitaries receive less opulent bashes than others. A White House spokesman declined to comment. The documents also reveal that the Obama White House retained an outside planner for the dinners. Bryan Rafanelli, a Boston-based celebrity event planner who was retained last year, managed former first daughter Chelsea Clinton's 2010 nupitals. His firm's website boasts that he produced "State Dinners hosted by President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama." WALSH Rafanelli's business partner, Mark Walsh, is deputy chief of the State Department's Office of Protocol, which reimburses the White House executive residence for the events. An attorney, Walsh worked on the 2008 presidential campaigns of both Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to his official online biography. Under a long-standing agreement, state dinner expenses are sent by the White House to Walsh's office for processing. His name does not appear in any of the documents obtained by the newspaper. Asked about the propriety of a White House contractor having a business relationship with a federal official in a position such as Walsh, Walters said, "I don't think it looks very good. Does it smell right? No." Walters said he never used outside event planners because "I believed the White House residence staff could do the job." A spokesman for Rafanelli declined to make him available for comment.

Jeffrey October 25, 2012 Subscribe to Terence P. Jeffrey's posts U.S. Treasury (CNSNews) - The number of American workers collecting federal disability insurance benefits hit yet another record high in October, according to the Social Security Administration. This month 8,803,335 disabled workers are collecting benefits, up from the previous record of 8,786,049 set in September. In February 2009, the first full month after President Barack Obama took office, there were 7,469,240 workers collecting federal disability insurance. Thus, so far in Obama’s term, the number of workers collecting disability has increased by 1,334,095. That works out to a net increase of about 29,646 per month (1,334,095 divided by 45 months), or an average increase of about 975 per day (1,334,095 divided by 1,369 days). During George Bush’s eight years as president, the number of workers collecting federal disability insurance increased by 2,375,258, rising from 5,067,119 in February 2001 to 7,442,377 in January 2009. That equaled an average net increase of about 24,742 per month and 813 per day. In Bush’s second term alone, the number of workers on disability increased by 1,198,575, equaling an average monthly increase of about 24,970 and an average daily increase of about 820.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1351285499465</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 17:04:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351285562097-114</Id><Topic><Title>Romney lover, explain why these</Title><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1351274240905</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 13:57:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama’s Outsourcer Company of Obama export adviser encourages outsourcing jobs to Mexico BY: Washington Free Beacon Staff October 26, 2012 2:35 pm The company of a prominent Obama administration adviser is encouraging its employees and business partners to explore outsourcing to Mexico. Boeing is urging its employees and suppliers to participate in a Nov. 15 event in Chicago, where Obama cast his vote for president Thursday, which will focus “on how to do business in Mexico,” according to a letter sent to the company’s suppliers by Patrick McKenna, Boeing’s director of Supply Chain Strategy and Supplier Management. “Several of our suppliers have successfully set up factories in Mexico because of the numerous advantages that Mexico offers to aerospace suppliers,” McKenna wrote, according to the letter sent Oct. 17 and first reported on by the Seattle Times. “Boeing will be sending several people to this event, and we wanted to inform our supply base of this opportunity.” The letter encouraging outsourcing has raised some eyebrows because Boeing CEO Jim McNerney currently serves as chairman of President Barack Obama’s Export Council. The outsourcing event will take place in the president’s hometown of Chicago where former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel currently serves as mayor. The conference is slated to “cover a range of topics related to manufacturing and doing business in Mexico and will have speakers from various companies who have successfully moved business into Mexico.” The event is being hosted by American Industries, a group dedicated to helping companies move their operations to Mexico. American Industries has promised to “waive the registration fees for our Boeing suppliers,” according to McKenna’s letter. A Boeing spokesperson did not respond to a Free Beacon request for comment. News of the letter and event drew a sharp response from at least one business leader, according to the Seattle Times: Tom Wroblewski, president of District 751 of the International Association of Machinists (IAM), reacted to the letter in political terms. “We’d think that Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, as chairman of President Obama’s council on exports, would be particularly sensitive to the importance of exporting American products, not jobs,” said Wroblewski, via email. “We plan on talking to Boeing about this. We believe it is counterproductive to what we are trying to accomplish here.” Boeing spokesman Larry Wilson said “it’s a matter of routine business” to keep the company’s suppliers informed of opportunities to expand their capacity around the world.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1351285562097</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 17:06:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351285997983-115</Id><Title>windows 8</Title><Msg>the good and the bad for you techies out there</Msg><Username>howdy11783</Username><Timestamp>1351285997983</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 17:13:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351287168087-116</Id><Topic><Title>FAUX Going To Extreams To Politicize Libya Deaths</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1351275427547</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 14:17:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama politized killing BinLaden and wouldn't send help for Stevens and others.

This isn't a question about Obama, who also gets the tax cut. Why does Romney get a handout of about $1,000,000/yr. from the taxpayers? Why does Obama need his, whatever it is, if you want to talk about Obama? The answer is like hawcreek12 said, they don't need it. They just like it and want it and had the political power to vote it in. You want more of that? It's a ruse and you are falling for it. They don't need it and aren't creating jobs with it. They invest the money? That's silly. Give it to all the poor people to invest then. They can, or they can buy 20, $50,000 toyotas too. Maybe they don't invest it at all, for romeny a million is only a month's after tax income. That is no explanation of why we give them this money. to give hem investment money for free. Now if they were paying a higher tax rate to begin with that's another story, but romney pays less than 14%. When JFK reduced the rate from 91% that was a totally different case, but of course the GOP brings up JFK lowered taxes without explaining it was 91%.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1351291124501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 18:38:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351292148895-120</Id><Topic><Title>Win 8 OS is a dismal failure</Title><Username>cspanosmwc</Username><Timestamp>1351256613493</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 09:03:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looks like someone is slow to adapt...

I wonder if the Kenyan tried to blow smoke up Mr. Woods as by telling HIM about the video? You know the coward didn't have the balls to do that because had he done that Mr. Woods would have solved all of America's problems right then and there because Mr. Woods said he knows the Kenyan is culpable in his son's death.

They had about 40 stations demoing the Surface. Every station but maybe 3 or 4 had someone playing with a surface. Usually a couple or more at each station. There were even a few AAPL employees from the nearby AAPL store checking out the competition. I saw about 4 sales while I was there and for all i know there were more being trained on a new purchase. I messed around with the surface and I thought it was pretty slick, though I'm holding off. I want to see what happens in the game development arena and if I bought one I'd probably get a Pro. As far as the device/OS I was impressed, and so was my wife. The employees were pretty good too. They weren't affraid to walk my 6 year-old through the painting application on another tablet while I tied up a different employee to get some inside scoop on the days events. My "helper" (i have no idea what MSFT is calling them... employees? associates? partners???? it all had a very AAPL Store feel to it.) He said there was a line out the door this morning. Which I have no reason to doubt. There were a lot of folks there while I was there and I assume this morning was much busier. And he said they sold a lot today. No idea if they did or not. Though I doubt he'd have said they didn't sell many, mostly "looky-loos".. But I can say that everyone I watched seemed impressed except the one AAPL employee that pointed at the MSFT guy's badge and said "that looks familiar" I liked the OS. it felt very PC, whatever that means. familiar I guess. I've not been a huge fan of iPads, iPhones, Androids even though I've owned a iPhone, Android phone and a Xoom. I'd say the interface of windows RT is by far better than anything I've ever used in the tablet universe. Its clean and responsive and intuitive. Using office was probably what impressed me the most, since I use it on a regular basis. Typing with keyboard and then selecting text and moving it, cutting, etc with my finger on the screen was pretty cool. He showed me how I could have Skype up on one half of the screen while office is open on the other half and conducted a skype call to another Surface to demo the camera. This was all on a local network so it worked flawlessly with no lag. I can tell there will be a learning curve for the thin keyboard (the 119 dollar one) but I don't imagine I'd have too much trouble with it, just a matter of getting used to it. THough I'd probably opt for the more mechanical one that i think costs 129. its a little thicker, but felt more like what I'm typing on now. That being said the thin one was impressive and worked a heck of a lot better than I was expecting and being able to choose your color I guess would have appeal to some. Me not being one of them. I can appreciate the customization but it wont push me in one direction or the other. I was impressed to learn you can hook up a monitor to it and extend desktop. I'm sure a touchscreen monitor would be ideal for my uses though using it for presentation is probably its intended purpose. I walked away from my demo impressed and I can certainly see how this could be a big hit for a large segment of professionals and pad users looking for more options. To me, the success of this will hinge on developers. powerful desktop applications with touchscreen i/o functionality. I don't have any reason to doubt that can't happen. But we shall see. My initial impression was pretty positive, but knowing there is a more powerful setup in the pipeline has me uninterested in the RT Surface. I'm sure there are more casual users that would be more than happy with it.</Msg><Username>dont_delay_indict_now</Username><Timestamp>1351309088770</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 23:38:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351309819950-164</Id><Topic><Title>San Antonio MSFT store</Title><Username>dont_delay_indict_now</Username><Timestamp>1351309088770</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 23:38:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NO DEVELOPERS SWEETHEART!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1351309819950</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 23:50:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
