When Hitler’s hordes stole Germany, they stormed town-halls across the Fatherland carrying their sacred symbols of nationalism reinforced by a form of Christianity that lent moral credence to mob rule. In fact, Nazism could not have risen had it not been for German evangelicals and fundamentalists embedded within the various religious sects and denominations. German Christians were seduced by the allure of national pride, and in doing so, the flag, eagle, and swastika became select idols of that time – images so sacred anyone caught desecrating them were put to death. Twenty-first century America is encumbered by a mass cult which is stripping away the nation’s constitutional rights, civil liberties, and potential greatness. Ironically, it is also threatening the very religious freedom for which they claim to cherish dearly. Symbols mean more than substance today. Little flag pins arouse more adoration than real acts of valor. FOX’s America preferred to investigate (and lie about) John Kerry’s medals than George Bush’s AWOL, cocaine use, and draft-dodging. FOX’s America preferred to perpetrate the Obama birth certificate myth than investigate torture and treason. Barack without a tie in the Oval Office elicited more outrage than Blackwater’s murders. It is symbolism the right-wing is after, not reality. Surface outweighs substance. Not only the flag, but the cross and Bible are erected as idols. And sadly, the national idolatry cult has racial overtones – like the original fascist movement 80 years before. Nazis venerated the flag, the swastika, Mein Kampf, and the eagle. The American right-wing venerates the flag, the cross, the Bible and the eagle. The parallels can’t be more apparent.</Msg><Username>therwnjneedhelp</Username><Timestamp>1351828886599</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 00:01:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351829081650-2</Id><Topic><Title>The reason the Kenyan can't come out and talk about Benghazi-Gate is because</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351823337241</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:28:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And remember the next day when the Musllim Monkey was at the podium tapping the mic laughing and saying,...

As always, Snow White stayed home doing her domestic chores. As lunchtime approached, she would prepare their lunch and carry it to the mine. One day as she arrived at the mine with the lunch, she saw that there had been a terrible cave-in. Tearfully, and fearing the worst, Snow White began calling out, hoping against hope that the dwarfs had somehow survived. "Hello, hello!" she shouted. "Can anyone hear me? Hello!" For a long while, there was no answer. Losing hope, Snow White again shouted, "Hello! Is anyone down there?" Just as she was about to give up all hope, there came a faint voice from deep within the mine. "Vote for Romney, Vote for Romney." Snow White fell to her knees, crossed herself and prayed, "oh thank you God, at least Dopey is still alive."</Msg><Username>beemerbe</Username><Timestamp>1351829851845</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 00:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351829942979-4</Id><Topic><Title>Freedom</Title><Username>therwnjneedhelp</Username><Timestamp>1351828886599</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 00:01:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go back to your altar and worship your Musllim Messiah you anti American pagan piece of communist she it.

"Fiat is in “very detailed conversations” with its Chinese partner, Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. (2238), about making Jeeps in the world’s largest auto market, said Mike Manley, chief operating officer of Fiat and Chrysler in Asia. Chrysler hasn’t built Jeeps there since before Fiat took control in 2009." Bloomberg ran a story indicating that production of Jeep brand vehicles might expand due to increasing demand in the Chinese market: the pathological liars in the Romney campaign distort this story to make a cheap smear against the incumbent President. Romney continues his lying in spite of being called out on it, a Romney "character" trait. Romney is such an astute "businessman" and "car guy" that he is unaware of the previous production of Jeep vehicles in China for the Chinese market by Diamler-Chrysler. Hawfreak and the wingnut smear machine pretends not to recall this either, in spite of the clear indication in the article of that being the case. Hawfreak finally remembers that there is a president of Chrysler Group but discounts the fact that Romney was rebuked as a liar by him. Hawfreak mangles reality as always, taking the opportunity to smear the President of the United States in the process. At long last, Hawfreak has no shame.</Msg><Username>nd1005</Username><Timestamp>1351853391304</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 06:49:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351855223327-11</Id><Title>the end is near</Title><Msg>the end of bulls4it commericals on TV.

There are nearly 700,000 people employed in motor vehicle manufacturing in the United States, and a growing number are employed by foreign car companies building vehicles closer to the customers who buy them."__ Spin and outright lies are pretty much all that's left for the desperate Tea Party lunatics and racists.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1351863233404</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 09:33:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351864564985-32</Id><Topic><Title>creek finds politically active blacks to be unworth associates.

Chrysler had already refuted a statement made to a crowd in Ohio by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney that Chrysler was moving all Jeep production from Ohio to China. Romney also has run campaign advertisements making similar statements. A 30-second television spot shows cars being crushed as a narrator says Obama “sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China. Mitt Romney will fight for every American job.” Chrysler has a Jeep plant that employs thousands of workers in Toledo, where many of the ads have run. But Marchionne told employees by email, "I feel obliged to unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China." This is from the horse's mouth. Anything out of *your* mouth is immediately suspect due to your constant obsequious fawning and boot licking (what else are you licking) re Romney.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1351867220514</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:40:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351867254026-39</Id><Title>Conservative and intellgent periodical "The Economist" chooses Obama for president.</Title><Msg>search this term. america-could-do-better-barack-obama-sadly-mitt-romney-does-not-fit-bill-which-one</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1351867254026</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:40:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351867465181-40</Id><Title>CPHI, next low float China play to go, just starting</Title><Msg>Will go nuts at .39</Msg><Username>dealerschoice10</Username><Timestamp>1351867465181</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:44:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351867574728-41</Id><Title>Obamma HATES the Military and America</Title><Msg>But NEARLY as much as they hate HIM.

Localizing means building cars where they are sold, building the entire portfolio where they are sold doesn't mean they are not still building the entire portfolio elsewhere. The portfolio is the car lineup. Get it? 4. production here isn't moving to China, an opportunity exists there for production for their market. China almost forces companies to locate there if they want to have sales. 5. oh yes Romney misunderstood simple business practices, and lied too. 6. on Monday 170 workers in IL lose their jobs in Romney's own plant, which is moving to CHINA 7. Chrysler said they are not moving USA Jeep jobs to China, now do you understand it? 8. Romney was trying to mislead people into thinking USA sold Jeeps are going to be made in China, of that there is no denying. Misleading is all he does, and that's LYING. 9. you lose again, romney's no good.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1351867927883</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 10:52:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351868608230-43</Id><Title>skkkrushi8n hates most of humanity and proves it with his daily raving</Title><Msg>course if he can kiss a RWNJ a... then he loves that person</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351868608230</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:03:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351868717058-44</Id><Topic><Title>When caught in a 'Jeep Move To China' lie Romney has to rely on his surrogates to spin.</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1351864574245</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 09:56:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YOU RACIST PIG..!!</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1351868717058</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:05:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351868869641-45</Id><Topic><Title>Freedom</Title><Username>therwnjneedhelp</Username><Timestamp>1351828886599</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 00:01:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How come you never mention the demise of Bin Laden, and other terrorists ?

She sounded like it was pre-arranged and important that she say that good stuff. But I really think she likes it. But really, nobody much cares what Oprah things because she no longer functions in daily like as a normal person. She will not reflect the true demand. Mutual funds are ready to dump Microsoft I believe, and onto Oprah's head as well. This is only yet another catalyst to get it to fall, imo, though perhaps a small one today. But if I were managing a fund, I'd probably use this against her and start dumping because there's something amusing about it too. Microsoft can no longer distinguish itself enough to business or the consumer, and all tablets and phones are just too alike in basic needs to be able to carve out any category killer anymore. They have a lot of cash but they are too conservative to earn much off that. Good luck to all who are not manipulating jerks on this board posting non-related trash to muck up the board.</Msg><Username>ohvirtuousone1</Username><Timestamp>1351875941163</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 13:05:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351875970605-69</Id><Topic><Title>Freedom</Title><Username>therwnjneedhelp</Username><Timestamp>1351828886599</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 00:01:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Benghazzi..........

Quoting: By Sarah Perez "According to new figures released from analyst firm IDC, Android shipments reached 136 million units in Q3 2012, which accounts for 75% of the 181.1 million shipments during the quarter. Or, as IDC puts it, "the Android operating system was found on three out of every four smartphones shipped during the third quarter of 2012." "Of course, remember that we’re looking at shipped figures, not sold here. Still, it’s indicative of the traction Android is having in the worldwide market. "A good part of Android’s recent growth has been influenced by the numbers coming out of Samsung over the past quarter. According to figures several analyst firms released earlier in the week, Samsung now has somewhere around 31%- 35% of smartphone market share." ________________________________________________ We shall see if Windows Phone 8 puts any dent at all in that....</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1351879224385</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 14:00:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351879317945-87</Id><Topic><Title>Are we at $35.00 yet???</Title><Username>riwm45</Username><Timestamp>1351782268560</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:04:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are we at $35.00 yet???

So now the fine people from Alabama traveled to help you and you told them to go away because they're not union employees? Go to Hell New Jersey. Evict those union thugs from your state first. Then come talk to me about assistance. You're damned lucky I don't run a food, fuel or building supply distribution business that could choose to route my supplies to New York instead of New Jersey -- because if I did, I would. Update: There are now people trying to deny this story. Riiiight -- the guys in the truck made it up? They drove how many hours just to run a scheme like that? I ain't buying it folks, but you're welcome to if you want.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1351888503310</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:35:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351888763363-134</Id><Title>Bush should have hosted a marathon in New Orleans a few days after Katrina</Title><Msg>And the looney leftist loser libs would have loved him too.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351888763363</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 16:39:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351888977521-135</Id><Title>Are intial stocks of Lumia 920 at EE (UK) already exhausted ?
