MSFT is the winner in the LT. GOOG is only good for search technology and AAPL is only good for toy products. When it comes to serious products for professional work then it is only MSFT SURFACE PRO. However, MSFT can to everything else that GOOG and AAPL tablets can do.

Quoting: 'The PC market got a dose of dire news recently after research firms IDC and Gartner released bleak forecasts for PC sales in 2013. Shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), Dell and Intel all plunged on the forecast, which revealed that Windows 8 wasn't the silver bullet that the industry needed to kill (or at least slow down) Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG). 'A glimmer of hope gets snuffed out 'During its second quarter, Microsoft reported that revenue at its Windows division rose 24%. The company stated that it has sold over 60 million Windows 8 licenses since its release last October. Although those numbers weren't too bad, sales at its Windows division have slowed for four consecutive quarters, which means that Windows 8 failed to attract the interest that the company had hoped for. 'Microsoft’s long-time ecosystem partners Intel, Hewlett-Packard and Dell had pinned their hopes on Windows 8. Asian partners Lenovo, Asus and Acer also claimed that Windows 8-powered ultrabooks would usher in a new era of strong PC sales. 'Did Microsoft just kill the PC market? 'Despite everyone’s high hopes for Windows 8 reviving the slumping PC market, Microsoft’s operating system has exacerbated its losses instead. Windows 8 has been met with mixed reviews, and is often criticized for its steep learning curve and hybrid system of tiles optimized for touch-screen devices. 'Bleak numbers from research firm IDC strongly suggest that the release of Windows 8 has contributed to the current free fall of the PC market. For the first quarter of 2013, IDC estimated that global PC shipments declined 13.9% year-on-year to 76.3 million units, worse than the 7.7% decline that it had previously forecast. U.S. PC shipments dropped 12.7% year-on-year. The Asia-Pacific region declined 10.3% year-on-year, with China and India posting the steepest drops.'</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365929895618</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 04:58:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365929977470-16</Id><Topic><Title>Windoze 7 'security' patch knocks out PCs, knackers antivirus tools</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365807584222</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 18:59:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Patches for patches?</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1365929977470</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 04:59:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365930039370-17</Id><Topic><Title>I would never use a microsoft product ever. 11 years since i did</Title><Username>joedquog</Username><Timestamp>1365701521155</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 13:32:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another dissatisfied customer, switching to something else.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1365930039370</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 05:00:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365930082284-18</Id><Topic><Title>Evaluation Finds Windows 8 to be Unusable and Even User-Hostile</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365710385149</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 15:59:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Windows Vista started the Death of the PC.

I'm totally happy with the Pres and am smart enough to realize he came into office in 2009 and saved the nation. He didn't start in 1776. Great President, and I am proud to pay my tax liability in full with no loopholes used.

I used Vista for two years. It was faulty in the beginning but the 2nd service pack fixed it for the most part. I've been in the computer business since the CPM days. Microsoft's worst OS was probably the ME which was supposed to bridge 98 to Win2K I believe. People have always been a little slow to accept new MS operating systems. Users came to love W95 although many clung to 3.1 as long as possible although many of them hated to leave the old DOS 6.2. Users then gradually accepted then clung to W95 and resisted W98 which in time they came to love. The ME was a big mistake but the Win2K and XP were very popular although once again W98 users put off switching to XP as long as possible. And then XP users hated the Win7 OS at first. Having used the Win8 for a couple of months I like it. I miss the Start Menu at times but 8 has some good features and it is not "bug-gy". There's no comparison with it and ME or Vista. I think MS could have helped a little more by displaying shortcut keys, etc. I had to "google" that topic to find a list. But the 8 is faster to boot, shutdown, and it installs printers more easily than any OS I've ever used.</Msg><Username>baronbuck</Username><Timestamp>1365954143704</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 11:42:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365954549741-46</Id><Topic><Title>The right to bear arms</Title><Username>beemerbe</Username><Timestamp>1365947628862</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 09:53:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A Classic definition of Delusional Paranoia....The government already tell us we can't own machine guns....</Msg><Username>beemerbe</Username><Timestamp>1365954549741</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 11:49:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365956974809-47</Id><Topic><Title>The right to bear arms</Title><Username>beemerbe</Username><Timestamp>1365947628862</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-14 09:53:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's true, the 2nd amendment itself states a well REGULATED militia.

It is said they can do every single thing you can do on your phone remotely. It is just puzzling that nothing is being done to google (yet) since the are enabling crimes and a gateway to crime.
