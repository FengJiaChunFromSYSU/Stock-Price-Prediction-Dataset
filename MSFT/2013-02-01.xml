NEW YORK (AP) — Some Mac users were taken by surprise Thursday as their computers stopped running programs written using the Java programming language after Apple blocked Java due to security problems.

That came as a surprise to most economists, who were expecting at least modest growth. So what happened? Holding back. Less spending from the Pentagon, for one. Government defense expenditures plunged by a staggering 22.2 percent between October and December. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Pentagon spent significantly less on just about everything except military pay. Had the Pentagon not cut back on spending, the economy would have grown at a weak but positive 1.27 percent pace. WHEN THE TEA PARTY MOES HARP ON FED SPENDING TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

Computerworld - Windows 8 fell further behind the pace of Windows Vista's uptake last month, a metric company said today, even as usage share of the new operating system continued to slowly climb. Statistics from Net Applications showed that Windows 8's January share was 2.5% of all Windows PCs, up from December's 1.9%. When what the analytics firm tagged as "touch" for Windows 8 and Windows RT were added, the January total rose slightly to 2.6%. Because Net Applications measures operating system usage share by tallying unique visitors to websites, the "touch" numbers reflected browsers -- overwhelmingly Internet Explorer 10 (IE10) -- run from the user interface once named "Metro" on Windows 8 and Windows RT. Even so, Windows 8 share lagged behind the 3.3% share that Vista scored after its third full month of availability. In fact, last month's seven-tenths of a point gap between the two was more than double the difference of three-tenths of a point in December, indicating that Windows 8 is not only not matching Vista's pace, but failing further behind. .........................................................................................</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1359762490302</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 18:48:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359764135755-61</Id><Topic><Title>I made 1.241% today to be exact, no thanks to obama</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1359763582927</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 19:06:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PT Barnum has openings for carnival barkers.

EVEN CFUNNY COULD FIGURE THEM OUT! Why is our lying pig media shielding Obama and his buffoons? They are giving Barack Obama a gold star for being present! Civilian labor force participation rate is stagnant at 63.6%. It hasn't been this low since 1980-1981. Employment-population ratio is stagnant at 58.6%. It hasn't been this low since 1983. Number of Unemployed increased from 12.2 million to 12.3 million. (There is babble about a 150k INCREASE in jobs that DID'T HAPPEN!) Unemployment rate increased from 7.8% to 7.9%. Why is that marvelous? This is STILL the worst long term employment/unemployment record in the history of the Bureau of Labor Statistics since 1948! Four Long Years of FAILURE! By the way, while I'm hearing about 150,000 new jobs, WHERE ARE THEY? Total Employment level for Jan-2013 is 143.322 million. For Dec-2012 it was 143.305 million. The difference is plus 17,000 jobs. Yippiee Ki Yah! Assuming those 150,000 jobs were actually created, at that rate it will take 84 months (7 years) to clear off 12.3 million unemployed (assuming the population doesn't grow!) What they're doing is comparing Sept-2012 (142.974 million) to Jan-2013 (143.322 million) and getting 338 thousand jobs and claiming that averages to 150 thousand jobs per month. Well, lets see: Oct, Nov, Dec, Jan = 4 (four!) months 348 thousand / 4 = about 87 thousand jobs per month, not 150 thousand. (They are getting that number from some other report!) Next I will hear how its all Bush's fault! Or that things would be worse if it weren't for the Stimulus Package. (Or some moron will tell me how Bush "almost" doubled the unemployment rate!)
