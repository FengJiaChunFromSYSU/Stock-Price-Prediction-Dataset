In November, Sony's PlayStation 3 received a quality certification from a Chinese safety standards body, prompting speculation that Beijing would lift the ban, which the government said was imposed in 2000 to safeguard children's mental and physical development. "We are reviewing the policy and have conducted some surveys and held discussions with other ministries on the possibility of opening up the game console market," the China Daily quoted an unnamed source from the Ministry of Culture as saying. "However, since the ban was issued by seven ministries more than a decade ago, we will need approval from all parties to lift it." An official at the ministry's cultural market department, which is responsible for the legislation, denied the report. "The ministry is not considering lifting the ban," the official, who identified himself only as Bai, told Reuters.</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1359358653077</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-28 02:37:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359364413680-2</Id><Title>Surface RT at Best Buy on line sold out</Title><Msg>this could be a good sign that Surface computers are gain nice traction. also, Surface computers are heading to Cosco, and Surface Pros are launching in about 10 days!!!!

I asked for not made in China. The only one losing money was the tire retailer, the cost was just as high for me as a US made tire, and less quality. That made in China lettering is not easy to see on black rubber, most people would take what the retailer talks them in to.
