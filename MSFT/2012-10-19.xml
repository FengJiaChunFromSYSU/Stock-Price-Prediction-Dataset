Earnings were scheduled for release, as always, after the closing bell. The earnings were released too early by their printers blindsiding the markets at 12:30 PM EST. The earnings were weaker than expected so traders hit the sell button first asking questions later. Price was moving across the 755 level and went off the edge of the cliff, dropping to 676 in only eight minutes time, about an 80 point drop, losing ten dollars in stock price per minute. Each candle on the chart above represents five minutes of trading time. The stock was halted from trading and then resumed trading at 3:20 PM where it finished the day moving thru the sideways blue channel shown above. The earnings were officially released at 4:30 PM and did not change. This is yet another stock trading debacle that Ma and Pa will point to proving the markets are nothing but a casino. Interestingly, all the GOOG long traders that planned on leisurely taking their profits in the afternoon, locking in gains, and not risking the earnings release, instead, were hosed. Price is in the vicinity of early September numbers, in other words, whoever bot GOOG over the last six weeks is now regretting it. On the lighter side, since it is never funny to see folks lose their dough, the premature earnings release had a three word statement printed at the top; 'PENDING LARRY QUOTE'. This is a placeholder where CEO Larry Page would provide a witty quip for the release, but, alas, all things imploded once the report was released too early. To no surprise, the 'Pending Larry Quote' goes viral in today's day and age, Twitter is all a flutter, and the domain name was arleady secured by one entrepreneur.

He also predicts that Obama’s plan to raise taxes on wealthier Americans would not solve even “a fraction” of the problem with the federal budget deficit. Schwab is founder and chairman of the Charles Schwab Corp., a discount brokerage that has made investing accessible to people around the globe. The San-Francisco-based company was founded in 1971 and now has more than 8 million brokerage accounts. In an exclusive interview with Newsmax TV in Florida on Thursday, Schwab — who supports Romney for president — was asked what Obama policies have been the most damaging to retirees in the Sunshine State and elsewhere. “The most difficult thing I have to see and watch in the Obama administration is their almost no-growth policy. Everywhere you turn it seems as if they’re suppressing growth —on an attitudinal thing, raising taxes or regulation. It goes on and on and on,” Schwab says. “And what has happened is the Obama administration has really deferred to the Federal Reserve to do anything that might help the economy. They brought interest rates down. In fact, they brought rates down to near zero. “Who took the brunt of all of that? It’s the seniors. There are 40 million seniors in the United States. Florida has a huge population of seniors and these people are suffering. They get virtually no interest on their CDs, their money market accounts, their savings accounts. These are things that people planned on 35, 40 years ago. They’ve just seen their income, their nest egg, sort of disappear. “Yes, they have the principal there, and that’s safe, but none of the income that they’d planned on to supplement their Social Security.” Story continues below the video.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350648140129</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 08:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350648198698-48</Id><Topic><Title>Romney is TEARING the Kenyan up at the Alfred E.

After I perused a list of your messages, it seems your very flip and carefree way of responding to people and full of emotion threw me as to what you are about. Certainly you do indulge yourself chatting about anything and everything with peoples' personal lives here. And probably politics. It is so sickening to see people use the boards here like that. Okay, I am glad to see a fellow short here. Maybe you could just refine how you respond a little as to raise the level a little bit here.

The big difference is that YOUR brain dead anti American Musllim Messiah said that he "will bankrupt the coal industry" and "necessarily make energy prices, sky-rocket!" And THAT'S the "hope and change" you more ons voted for.

Ever heard of "Freedom of Religion"? Apparently not. But that won't stop you from trying to project your childish mythological beliefs on the rest of us, will it? Your ilk piously attempt to wrap yourselves in the cloak of the Constitution, particularly the First Amendment, even while you deny that anyone but yourselves are guaranteed protection under it. The old bigot, Graham, labeled Mormonism a cult and maintained that position for decades until he had to choose between a Mormon and a black man. Everything anyone would need to know about rank hypocrisy is perfectly illustrated in the reversal of his "opinion" and the scrubbing of all references of or to it from his web site. He is NOT my spiritual leader and your proclamation is presumptive and arrogant. That seems to be a common characteristic of Tea Party and other far right factions of the GOP these days.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1350664200878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 12:30:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350664508426-117</Id><Topic><Title>Game changing report</Title><Username>edazmgcp23189</Username><Timestamp>1350654122954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 09:42:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love free reports.

This book described itself as a chronicle of early indigenous peoples of the Americas, portraying them as believing Israelites, who had a belief in Christ many hundred years before his birth. Smith dictated the book of 584 pages over a period of about three months[5] saying that he translated it from an ancient language "by the gift and power of God".[6] During production of this work in mid-1829, Smith, his close associate Oliver Cowdery, and other early followers began baptizing new converts into a Christian primitivist church, formally organized in 1830 as the Church of Christ.[7] Smith was seen by his followers as a modern-day prophet.[8] Smith later wrote that he had seen a vision of God the Father and Jesus Christ in spring 1820 in answer to his question of which denomination he should join.[9] Sometimes called the "First Vision", Smith's vision of God the Father and Jesus Christ as two separate beings was reportedly the basis for the difference in doctrine between Mormonism's view of the nature of God and that of orthodox Christianity. Smith further said that in answer to his prayer the Lord instructed him to join none of the existing churches because they were all wrong.[10] During the 1820s Smith reported having several angelic visitations, and by 1830 Smith said that he had been instructed that God would use him to re-establish the true Christian church and that the Book of Mormon would be the means of establishing correct doctrine for the restored church.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1350668901742</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 13:48:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350669599917-135</Id><Title>Why Privatizing Social Security is Unnecessary</Title><Msg>...and stupid as ideas go.

So here is device I want to build. 1. Mobile phone (may be based on X86 processor since ARM does not support full os) 2. Tablet has slot to put mobile phone in side and run os from single source. ( Share OS/Application &amp; data everything but has build in additional memory and may be additional processor) 3. Laptop/ PC (Same as above but must able to operate with own high performance motherboard/ CPU/Memory to provide performance I need. Wish I have funding to do that. It's not that hard to achieve. If someone come up with such products, I think it will kill every other player including Apple/Google. Please Note: Apple deep into iOS eco system that it can't make single platform with MAC unless they ready to take risk. Google has half cook OS which they stole from Linux. Running into 10 path mess that not easy to cleanup. So no one even close to compete on single platform.</Msg><Username>vgsalvi</Username><Timestamp>1350671949867</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 14:39:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350671963697-150</Id><Topic><Title>Go and buy tvix noW 31.50 weLL be by next wek 45$</Title><Username>mgmg1948</Username><Timestamp>1325089304000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2011-12-28 11:21:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no...</Msg><Username>alaninvestor</Username><Timestamp>1350671963697</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 14:39:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350672260081-151</Id><Title>Funds are UNLOADING MSFT VERY HARD....

The next mornng and the day after he told about the attack, in exactly the words he said he used to the letter, what more do you need? When you try to protect a misinformed, unqualified, candidate from looking like an utter fool on national tv, you need to man up to it and take responsibility instead.

According to the Microsoft online store, the RT tablet's $499 32GB model (without the Touch Cover) sold out in a day. It is now scheduled to ship "within three weeks." Pre-orders for the the two remaining devices — the $599 32GB and $699 64GB, both with the black Touch Cover — are still expected to deliver by Oct. 26. Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the shipping delays, and provided no further details on its website. Microsoft started accepting pre-orders for the RT version of the Surface tablet on Tuesday. Touch covers are available separately for $119.99 each in black, white, magenta, cyan, and red. The pressure is on for Redmond, which will release its Windows 8 operating system on Oct. 26. Several days later, it is hosting a Windows Phone 8 launch event in San Francisco. PCMag will be there for both events, so stay tuned for all the details. Limited pre-order supplies are common amongst highly anticipated products. Last month, the iPhone 5 sold out of its initial inventory in just one hour, topping 2 million orders within a day and pushing delivery dates to two weeks. Many iPhone 5's ended up arriving earlier than expected, though. Meanwhile, the 16GB version of Google's Android-based Nexus 7 tablet was out of stock less than a month after its release, leaving only the smaller 8GB available for purchase through the Google Play store. About a week later, the Asus-manufactured tablet was back on shelves. For more, see PCMag's hands on with Microsoft's Surface Tablet and the slideshow below.

In turn, the reflectiveness of the Surface’s display is much lower than the iPad, resulting in higher contrast of colors and more visible detail • Why no USB 3.0?

Oh dear, that’s funny, I forgot to add “memory moment” to the list above. Senility Base is somewhere on the back-side of the moon, way back there, where nobody ever travels, except the extremely elderly. They go from a state of tiredness and sleep deprivation to awareness, to exhaustion, day in and day out, always plugging a portion of their earnings into a totally mismanaged system that will return very little for their investment, if they ever make it alive to the day that payback begins. I believe it was William Shakespeare that said “Things done well and with a care exempt themselves from fear”. So, how well has the Social Security been planned, tracked and managed, and how much care and attention to detail has it received?” It was the responsibility of every official that took office in Washington D.C., for the last 100 years. You can throw money at a problem, but that doesn’t cure the underlying disease.

If they had taken my installments over the years, earning the typical 10% per year for the major stock indices, then it would have accumulated a handsome lifetime sum and a respectable retirement check, by the ripe old age of 55 or 62, definitely not so ripe as age 70, or beyond (as in beyond the grave). They blew it, and they will continue to. Governments do not perform to the standards of free enterprise. It is a mistake to continue to try to heal a bad system. If a dam breaks, you don’t patch it. You rebuild. When a bridge can no longer provide passage for the vehicle volume, you build a bigger and better bridge, and you let a better firm construct it. Of course, it might be wiser to build more bridges, smaller and in various locations, to allow the flow not to bottleneck. Does all this ranting by me mean that I’m in favor of curtailing Social Security? Absolutely not! Wisdom teaches that you take care of the old and we can build a new system, with many small administrators, and a properly timed migration of new employees and old retirees to the new system over time. We certainly don’t want a big unmanageable system, too big to fail, like the banks, now do we? In the end, the old system will be retired itself. The new system could be managed by capitalistic enterprising funds, not the government. The government will always have people that will work against the system for their own political purposes, causing a schism within the Social Security system. But, a well managed and regulated system in the hands of venture capitalists, will allow it to grow, to produce, to reward its administrators with healthy bonuses, and it will be in their interests for it to succeed. The internal government conflict will be removed, the status quo eliminated, and the conflict of interests put to rest. Social Security's financial problems have loomed for decades as the nation's 78 million baby boomers approached retirement age. The oldest are already there and as that huge group of people begin collecting benefits, they will also stop paying payroll taxes, leaving Social Security's funds shrinking. They are predicted to run out of money by 2037, according to the latest projection from the trustees who</Msg><Username>counter_insurgency_buff</Username><Timestamp>1350684583415</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 18:09:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350684699100-212</Id><Title>Bill Gates stolen Surface computer of mine</Title><Msg>Bil Gates is trying to play catch up with the Surface tablet.

You can also buy wheat and grind up to make your own bread. I buy Microsoft because I love how it all works together. All these people talking about Windows 8 and most have never used it, or used it for 10minutes. I love it. I will get an Al in one pc for home with touch. This will be awesome. Microsoft didn't hit their numbers, they deferred 1.3 billion. Not many companies can defer 1.3 billion. The company people love to hate. Most analyst have no idea what they are saying. Tablet won't compete because it does not have enough apps, then they state iPad has 600k apps. Ask them to name 25 apps they want or need, ask them to name the top 25. They can't. But rest assured Microsoft supports all of them. I don't need 49000 versions of solitary.
