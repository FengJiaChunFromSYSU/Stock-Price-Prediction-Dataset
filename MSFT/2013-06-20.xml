An insurance company in Guatemala is suing Microsoft for allegedly raiding its offices with armed police officers to search for pirated software. Paul Brinkmann of the South Florida Business Journal, first reported on the lawsuit on Monday. Here's what the company, Seguros Universales SA of Guatemala City, claims happened during the April 2012 raid: "Microsoft appeared with armed Guatemalan law enforcement officers and halted plaintiffs’ business operations. Microsoft then proceeded to extort Plaintiffs by demanding an on-the-spot agreement to pay $70,000 or Microsoft would remove all… servers containing ALL data and operational software." Seguros Universales also alleges that Microsoft tried to strong-arm other Guatemalan insurance firms into paying on-the-spot fines for using pirated software, Brinkmann reported. But Microsoft has a different version of how things went down. "Seguras Universales confessed to a Guatemalan judge and prosecutor that it used illegal software and freely entered into an agreement to compensate Microsoft for its wrongdoing," a Microsoft spokesperson told us in an email. "This suit is a meritless attempt to distract from its own software piracy, and we look forward to addressing the claims," the spokesperson said. Microsoft is a member of the Business Software Alliance, an industry group that tracks usage of illegal software. In a 2011 survey, the BSA found that 79% of software in use in Guatemala is pirated, compared to 61% for Latin America as a whole, and 42% globally</Msg><Username>shurlock_homes</Username><Timestamp>1371705107123</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 01:11:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371705143110-10</Id><Topic><Title>DID YOU KNOW SAFARI IS THE FASTEST SEARCH ENGINE....WOW,,,,APPLE BEATS EM ALL !</Title><Username>eight_suckz</Username><Timestamp>1371599022704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-18 19:43:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is a Mac safe from PC viruses?

The flash HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.3 in June from May's final reading of 49.2, drifting further away from the 50-point level demarcating expansion from contraction. It was the weakest level since September. "Manufacturing sectors are weighed down by deteriorating external demand, moderating domestic demand and rising destocking pressures," said Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC. "Beijing prefers to use reforms rather than stimulus to sustain growth. While reforms can boost long-term growth prospects, they will have a limited impact in the short-term. As such we expect slightly weaker growth in 2Q." China's economy grew at its slowest pace for 13 years in 2012 and so far this year economic data has underwhelmed, bringing warnings from some analysts that the country could miss its growth target of 7.5 percent for this year. The Australian dollar hit a fresh 33-month low after the latest bearish data, which fuelled worries</Msg><Username>shurlock_homes</Username><Timestamp>1371705184618</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 01:13:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371705246277-12</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT CO-FOUDER PAUL ALLEN HATES 8 TOO.

Further, he also mentions that it's impossible to keep the Metro interface on one display permanently, which would be ideal for those who like a dashboard. Another complaint is pretty mind-boggling to me. Because Windows 8 can associate a protocol to either an app in the Metro interface or on the desktop, you could find yourself looking at the opposite interface depending on how things are configured. As Allen's example lays out, clicking on a URL while using Outlook on the desktop can open it up in Internet Explorer inside of the Metro interface - and I assume the vice versa can also be true. This is a major beef with me because I'm drawn to OSes that improve efficiency and workflow - not those that destroy it..A DIRECT PASTE IN OF ALLEN'S INTERVIEW.

PC sales could drop by as much as 10% this year and a lackluster response to its Windows 8 operating system has prodded the company to begin work on a new version of the product (to be released later this year). Where the company has shown consistent strength is in its entertainment division. Its latest release, Xbox 360, managed to overcome major technical issues and offer big processing power with superior online functionality. The unit sold over 75 million units and brought more than 40 million customers to its Xbox Live online gaming service, making it one of the most acclaimed gaming consoles ever. But Microsoft's top positioning in these sectors is starting to look vulnerable, as the recently announced XBox One has been met with general disappointment in two areas: Xbox One users must maintain broadband internet connectivity and login at least once every 24 hours in order to play the games they have bought, and game publishers can block users from lending games or giving them away. In addition, rentals will not be supported when the new unit is launched. There are also privacy concerns, since large amounts of private data (videos, photos, and even things like recorded facial expressions and heart rate) are uploaded and saved on outside servers</Msg><Username>billyslimeball</Username><Timestamp>1371705338779</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 01:15:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371705377280-14</Id><Topic><Title>THINGS I'M LEARNING ABOUT APPLE.

PC sales could drop by as much as 10% this year and a lackluster response to its Windows 8 operating system has prodded the company to begin work on a new version of the product (to be released later this year). Where the company has shown consistent strength is in its entertainment division. Its latest release, Xbox 360, managed to overcome major technical issues and offer big processing power with superior online functionality. The unit sold over 75 million units and brought more than 40 million customers to its Xbox Live online gaming service, making it one of the most acclaimed gaming consoles ever. But Microsoft's top positioning in these sectors is starting to look vulnerable, as the recently announced XBox One has been met with general disappointment in two areas: Xbox One users must maintain broadband internet connectivity and login at least once every 24 hours in order to play the games they have bought, and game publishers can block users from lending games or giving them away. In addition, rentals will not be supported when the new unit is launched. There are also privacy concerns, since large amounts of private data (videos, photos, and even things like recorded facial expressions and heart rate) are uploaded and saved on outside servers</Msg><Username>wilameenaweena</Username><Timestamp>1371738391319</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 10:26:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371738428837-42</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT CO-FOUDER PAUL ALLEN HATES 8 TOO.

Further, he also mentions that it's impossible to keep the Metro interface on one display permanently, which would be ideal for those who like a dashboard. Another complaint is pretty mind-boggling to me. Because Windows 8 can associate a protocol to either an app in the Metro interface or on the desktop, you could find yourself looking at the opposite interface depending on how things are configured. As Allen's example lays out, clicking on a URL while using Outlook on the desktop can open it up in Internet Explorer inside of the Metro interface - and I assume the vice versa can also be true. This is a major beef with me because I'm drawn to OSes that improve efficiency and workflow - not those that destroy it..A DIRECT PASTE IN OF ALLEN'S INTERVIEW.

The flash HSBC Purchasing Managers' Index fell to 48.3 in June from May's final reading of 49.2, drifting further away from the 50-point level demarcating expansion from contraction. It was the weakest level since September. "Manufacturing sectors are weighed down by deteriorating external demand, moderating domestic demand and rising destocking pressures," said Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC. "Beijing prefers to use reforms rather than stimulus to sustain growth. While reforms can boost long-term growth prospects, they will have a limited impact in the short-term.

Sony on the other hand has only said that the PS4 will arrive in time for the Holidays this year, which means a release could happen any time from September right up until December. It looks likely Sony will go head-to-head with Microsoft in November, though, if a UK newspaper advertisement is to be believed. The Sun newspaper has a PS4 advert that highlights the price of the new console as well as reminding everyone you can trade your used games easily and don’t need the Internet to use it. But it also lists a launch date of November 21. The advert certainly doesn’t look fake, but it seems unlikely Sony wouldn’t make a big deal about announcing the launch date. So chances are the newspaper has messed up and printed the advertisement too early. Sony has a lot of flexibility in the date that it picks, so this could actually be a planned accident. What they would really like to happen is for Microsoft to confirm the Xbox One release day first, then Sony can do the maximum damage by choosing to launch around then, probably just before, in an attempt to steal sales and drown out Microsoft’s marketing.</Msg><Username>helenwaite12</Username><Timestamp>1371738722477</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 10:32:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371738893578-53</Id><Topic><Title>EVERY FRIGGIN TIME MY PC HAS A RE-START, THERE IS BING.

Stock trading isn't a game, and spamming the mesage boards and trying to get people to follow is ridiculous. You do understand that it is an absolute impossibility for you to move the market in your favor, right? Regarding your post - and everyone elses "go long" posts - MSFT is a range trading stock. If it dips below 25 you buy it, if it goes above 28 you sell it. Following this logic, you will never lose money. In our recent case, the stock ran up to 36 due to general market exhuberance. It does not reflect 'true value' because Microsoft, like many blue chips, is not sexy. The introduction of new products does not increase the value of the company - it just keeps it out of a death spiral. My prediction is that Microsoft will breach 30 in the near term and continue back to 25, as it always does. This is no place to go long.</Msg><Username>jackjones367</Username><Timestamp>1371747928646</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 13:05:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371749378529-83</Id><Topic><Title>Below $34 !!!!</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1371742021372</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 11:27:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You do understand that it is an absolute impossibility for you to move the market in your favor, right?" Wrong! A thinly traded stock can be "Moved" by just one big trader, furthermore, a stock trading room with enough members acting together can move a thinly traded stock. If you're not beginner you should remember the Hunt Brothers moving Silver market all by their selves. Moving a behemoth such as MSFT takes more effort, but it can and has been done by the government. I think you're naive and stupid.</Msg><Username>misterreality14</Username><Timestamp>1371749378529</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 13:29:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371749384822-84</Id><Topic><Title>Balmer could have had nokia at 2 bucks , now he wants it? for 6 bucks?

Based on the lax oversight and heads turning the other way (reminder: Obama is a Chicago politician, land of corruption!) , they will do whatever they need to so they can take the average investor's money, fool the media into reporting whatever they say as a "fact" (that is, if the media is not complicit at the higher levels and the stooge "reporters" are duped into believing it), and basically legitimize the actions with some bs that makes it sound plausible. The Name of the Game is how can the rich steal from the poor and middle class given the "zero-sum" game of the markets - if someone wins, someone else has to lose based on "the game." Guess who's going to win - hint: not you, if you're not on the inside. Just like any good casino, they will let you "win" for a while and then stick it to you. Someone is making money on today's action - let's see, hmmm, those who orchestrated this at this time?! I would not be surprised if there is a weekly or monthly "script" as to what happens next and when, down to the very point fluctuations in each market. The market is rigged and getting worse. I wouldn't trust it - and look for it to shoot back up wih some other bogus excuse. It's all disgusting, and that they get away with it makes it more so. And the "regulators"? Where are they?

No rental games, used games or trading, always connected to the internet built in spy camera and mic always on. You kidding me????

Since there are so many people that have family in different countries, far away and serving in the military this is a dream come true. Full HD is like sitting in the room with the person. The businesses that use video conferencing pay an arm and a leg. Most businesses can plug one HDMI cable in and set up a Skype account. After that they say XBOX ON. They do not need Cisco's care people walking them through and training people. Cisco is going to find a decline in that area unfortunately. XBOX One offers something for TV viewers, Music Lovers, Gamers, NFL Fans, Exclusive content fans, etc. If you think it will fail with all due respect you should not be doing anything yourself with stock.

Quoting: .... "On the other side of the Dow, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is among the biggest losers on index today, with shares falling 2.9%. However, its troubles have nothing to do with the improving state of the economy or the drying-up of stimulus funds. The company's backpedaling from its previous heavy-handed policies regarding its next-generation Xbox One video game console has generated mixed sentiment among consumers and shareholders. While many view Microsoft's reversal of its earlier used-games restriction and "always-on" Internet connection as a win for consumers, others see the company succumbing to a fickle fan base and rival Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) early lead in console pre-orders. "One thing's for certain, however: Sony's PlayStation 4 next-gen console scored a serious victory by touting its consumer-friendly policies over Microsoft's Xbox One, and if Microsoft hadn't pulled an about-face, the company risked losing sales to its rival in a big way right out of the gate. That's one thing no company wants to see -- especially one like Microsoft, which already struggles in other areas of its business, including its poorly received Windows 8 operating system and disappointing Surface tablet." ______________________________________ We're not making it up, folks.

In fact, on Wednesday, two members of the Fed’s board — James Bullard and Esther George — dissented in the statement that was released. In the past Jeff Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, has made waves for being an outspoken dissenter, too. Like Congress, the Federal Reserve is made up of different people with different opinions — and this is a good thing because it shows that the central bank is thinking critically and challenging its own members. But too much dissent risks sowing chaos in central bank policy, and that is not something the market needs. Quantitative easing and central bank efforts on this scale are uncharted territory, so it’s dangerous to paint with a broad brush with phrases like “the Fed is just printing money.” Thinking more rationally about the nature of QE can help investors in this time of uncertainty.</Msg><Username>djhmk2</Username><Timestamp>1371762451257</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 17:07:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371762465997-121</Id><Topic><Title>8 MORE LOSER DAYS LIKE TODAY AND THIS WILL BE ABOUT THERE. 8 THAT'S 8. $25.

That will help you make smarter decisions.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1371765569264</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 17:59:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371765665219-127</Id><Topic><Title>Hell of a buy right now</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1371755200752</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 15:06:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Short interest is dropping.

I believe his words where investors should hedge their bets. I see Microsoft going straight back up to 35 in my opinion. I am going to take a chance and go against Alan Greenspan. Microsoft is coming into the peak of their existence. I am a developer for Internet, apps and also infrastructure. Microsoft has amazed me this time. Ballmer would not quit. They were throwing punches left and right and he not only remained standing but came out a champion. The Xbox One, Windows 8, Windows Phone &amp; Surface are all fantastic innovations. It is a bad economy. Samsung is not selling, Facebook cannot give the Home phone away, Apple lost their way and sales are horrible. It is a cheap shot to say Surface is not a success in an economy when no one except a company that gives their product away for free sells devices. Google gives their devices away at a loss, just to get the click fraud income. They know that someone will be a Chrome book or whatever it is called and click on their competitors ads to run up the bills. That is how google made it's money by businesses clicking on their competitors ads. Microsoft is firing on all cylinders and is the leader in innovation. Just my opinion.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1371767402361</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:30:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371767541047-130</Id><Topic><Title>Buying in to close, may gap</Title><Username>dscmsunw</Username><Timestamp>1371758061889</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 15:54:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what will you do if it gaps down? will it be too late to buy more? ;-) or did you save a little cash in case it drops further?</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1371767541047</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:32:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371767676515-131</Id><Topic><Title>Buying in to close, may gap</Title><Username>dscmsunw</Username><Timestamp>1371758061889</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 15:54:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what if it gaps up tomorrow, l2? will you sell the remaining 20 or take a beating chasing the price on the way up? ;-)</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1371767676515</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:34:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371767779785-132</Id><Topic><Title>Everyone is aware that MS has completely changed their Xbox One plan???</Title><Username>creephhi</Username><Timestamp>1371753219860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 14:33:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he means they will riot in china. at foxconn again ...</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1371767779785</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 18:36:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371767816438-133</Id><Topic><Title>Buying in to close, may gap</Title><Username>dscmsunw</Username><Timestamp>1371758061889</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-20 15:54:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think MSFT has major strength.

Quoting: .... "On the other side of the Dow, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is among the biggest losers on index today, with shares falling 2.9%. However, its troubles have nothing to do with the improving state of the economy or the drying-up of stimulus funds. The company's backpedaling from its previous heavy-handed policies regarding its next-generation Xbox One video game console has generated mixed sentiment among consumers and shareholders. While many view Microsoft's reversal of its earlier used-games restriction and "always-on" Internet connection as a win for consumers, others see the company succumbing to a fickle fan base and rival Sony's (NYSE: SNE ) early lead in console pre-orders. "One thing's for certain, however: Sony's PlayStation 4 next-gen console scored a serious victory by touting its consumer-friendly policies over Microsoft's Xbox One, and if Microsoft hadn't pulled an about-face, the company risked losing sales to its rival in a big way right out of the gate. That's one thing no company wants to see -- especially one like Microsoft, which already struggles in other areas of its business, including its poorly received Windows 8 operating system and disappointing Surface tablet." ______________________________________ We're not making it up, folks.
