Some debt can be OK, but it is a relationship of debt to the overall economy. Bush GREW the economy, and the percentage of debt to our growing economy was serviceable. Obama greatly increased govt spending at the same time he contracted the real economy...a double dose of disaster. Now the debt has reached 100% of our total national economy...a doomsday scenario. Why? Because he adapted/supported a big govt socialist expansion of the federal govt. while raising taxes, increasing expensive, burdensome regulations on the private sector that pays the bills. We continue to contract the private sector as a result of Obama's fascist policies.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1360247478335</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 09:31:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360248302909-9</Id><Title>Microsoft can't tap into the fast-growing tablet market - Disappointing Windows 8 sales</Title><Msg>Microsoft can't tap into the fast-growing tablet market, according to new figures that reveal lacklustre sales of Surface RT and other Windows 8 slabs. Canalys figures for Q4 show a 12 per cent growth in the worldwide PC market, fuelled by a 75 per cent rise in tab shipments to 46.2 million units. Notebooks sales were flat (58 million), desktops declined 5 per cent (28 million) and netbooks took their last gasps of breath. More Reading APAC PC shipments FALL for first time ever in 2012 New stats: Blighty's PC market ended 2012 on its KNEES HP still top of PC league, but trailing fourth in all-devices rankings Yet Microsoft wasn't able to seize a big slice of the action - only 1.6 million Windows-based tabs were bought by customers - including 722,000 Surface RT devices. This represents a tab market share of 3.4 per cent. "Windows 8 launched late in the year and was a massive departure from the existing operating systems, so consumers played a wait-and-see game," said Tim Coulling, senior analyst at Canalys.

They have to deliver at every address in the USA every day, mind boggling how they do it really. Maybe they need to go to a demand basis like UPS and Fedex. That's a big change to a great country, not to have a mail service. They do a very good job, better than UPS or Fedex I think. Many documents still need to be mailed, maybe we should see if UPS would take 46 cents to deliver a piece of paper to me. I have no problem with subsidizing the post office, we are still a developed country. Yes, probably was before Obama. Times will get better, bringing manufacturing back, and people becoming more aware it isn't all about their own wealth that matters. We will come back, even better, with a post office too.

It is a well known fact that libs caused the housing crisis that brought down the world economies as well as ours. There is plenty of evidence to support that fact. And wars? Again, congressional libs supported the war, DEMANDED that we go to war in fact! You had libs on our national security/intelligence committee that said we had to go to war.

The CBO also predicted that because of the $85 billion in spending cuts, the GNP and other economic growth indicators will continue to fall in 2013. This panicked the Obama White House. The 2012 Fourth Quarter GNP dropped to -0.1%. If the GNP goes negative again for the First Quarter of 2013, we will officially be in an Obama Recession. Obama immediately held a press conference. However, the fearful and agitated Obama would not take any questions from the news media. Obama also would not comment on why for the fourth consecutive year he has not presented his budget proposal in a timely manner. Obama’s Sequester, originally intended to intimidate and divide the Republicans, has come back to bite Obama hard.

A table wtih Excel, MS Word, Powerpoint is a production tool, not just a passive toy. It will be a hit. It's Windows. And the Surface Pro, like the Windows Phone and the move into desktop hardware with HP is all about NEW GROWTH. Growth in Enterprise? We see it in the numbers. And now we know MSFT is targeting the African Contient with serious focus. XBox is going after Netflix and Amazon with streaming movies. Those XBoxes are sitting underneat a lot of televisions, folks. More growth here, too. This corporation is about to take off just like Yahoo did (which I began buying last year in the $14's. MSFT is a big locomotive that now has serious, serious upside momentum. Don't miss the train. It's about to leave the station and it isnt' coming back.</Msg><Username>scooponcoop</Username><Timestamp>1360272024915</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 16:20:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360272503507-75</Id><Topic><Title>DELISTING + CHAPTER 11 VERY SOON TIMBERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR</Title><Username>pharmaherooe</Username><Timestamp>1360269284705</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 15:34:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>put it down-get back up on the couch and take your knap</Msg><Username>raggwead</Username><Timestamp>1360272503507</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 16:28:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360273940732-76</Id><Topic><Title>DELISTING + CHAPTER 11 VERY SOON TIMBERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR</Title><Username>pharmaherooe</Username><Timestamp>1360269284705</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 15:34:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How does it feel to be a dancing clown?</Msg><Username>cwrasmith</Username><Timestamp>1360273940732</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 16:52:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360275618739-77</Id><Title>Ballmer is killing this software giant...</Title><Msg>his inertia is suffocating!</Msg><Username>gollywogazoo</Username><Timestamp>1360275618739</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 17:20:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360276321519-78</Id><Topic><Title>Panetta Under Oath: Obama Uninterested and Absent During Benghazi Attack</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1360264398934</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 14:13:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what does our president not giving a shet about what is happening to our Libyan Ambassador have to do with the tanking America?

You may recall that last November CEO Steve Ballmer was crowing about what a success the Windows Phone 8 launch had been, and that Microsoft was selling four times as many Windows Phone devices as it had during November 2011. But as we all know, four times nothing is still nothing, and based on the current numbers, it looks like sales of devices running Microsoft's latest mobile OS have hardly been anything to phone home about. The data released on Wednesday shows Microsoft's platform accounting for a measly 3.6 per cent share of smartphone subscriptions during the three months ending September 2012, just before the first Windows Phone 8 devices were due to ship. You might have expected to see a sales spike once Microsoft's WinPhone hype machine kicked into full gear. But by the end of December 2012 – well after the Phone 8 launch, not to mention the holiday shopping season – Redmond's share had dropped even further, down to 2.9 per cent. ===============================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1360288149008</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 20:49:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360288189773-102</Id><Topic><Title>See you at The eternal $25 REAL SOON</Title><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1360251282269</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 10:34:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It does seem like we cannot break out of the $25 - $28 range.

You never answer what time.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1360292627813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 22:03:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360293738489-108</Id><Topic><Title>More Americans convinced of the reality of climate change.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1360281971150</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 19:06:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stupid is what stupid does!</Msg><Username>dogeater2013</Username><Timestamp>1360293738489</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 22:22:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360293825160-109</Id><Topic><Title>This morning the Barista tried to get me to try a new blend</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1360266443310</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 14:47:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yah, fake skeet shooting is always "taken" from the side, yah that's it. If it's real skeet shooting, it is always "taken" from behind and shows the broken skeets too, yah that's right. There's only one picture, why not more? Yah, why not more, one means it's a photo op to prove the lie was true. Yah that's it. Obama didn't know better and those around him too, yah that's it, gottem now.. Proves it wasn't true and he lied, yah. There's your facts and proof. Only I haveta say if it was "taken" from behind, we would say it isn't him but a look alike from behind. Then it would still be fake skeet shooting, even if "taken" from behind. Here we are in 2013, the terrorists are trying to kill us, north korea is shooting missles, iran is sending rockets up, people are shooting children anywhere, and we talk about if it's fake or real skeet shooting at Camp david from studying a picture all day.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1360293825160</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 22:23:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360295352782-110</Id><Topic><Title>Acquisition Oracle</Title><Username>fisk007</Username><Timestamp>1360253383603</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-07 11:09:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>SONS and BSFT announce partnership.
