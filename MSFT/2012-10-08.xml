Any tax breaks to corporations that move jobs and profits overseas, he had never heard of such a thing. Who knew? Who knew?” (President Barack Obama, Presidential Debate, Denver, CO, 10/5/12) THE FACTS: “ Under Present Law, There Are No Tax Credits Or Disallowance Of Deductions Specific To Locating Jobs In The United States Or Transferring Jobs Overseas.” “Under present law, there are no tax credits or disallowance of deductions specific to locating jobs in the United States or transferring jobs overseas. However, Congress has provided various credits to encourage certain activities or behavior and has disallowed deductions to curtail behavior deemed inappropriate or to discourage certain economic choices.” (“Descriptions Of Revenue Provisions Contained In The President’s Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Proposal,” Joint Committee On Taxation, p.73, 6/12) The Actual Tax Provision Obama References Would Raise Only $17 Million A Year, Or What You’d “Call A Rounding Error” With Obama’s $1 Trillion Annual Budget Deficits. “Moreover, it is pretty small potatoes given the attention Democrats pay to it. The JCT estimated that ending the deduction for moving operations overseas would raise just $168 million over a decade. In the federal government with an annual budget deficit of more than $1 trillion, that’s what you call a rounding error.” (Glenn Kessler, “Factchecking The First Presidential Debate Of 2012,” The Washington Post ‘s The Fact Checker , 10/4/12) OBAMA HAS RECYCLED THIS PROMISE FOR YEARS 2004: Obama Said He Wanted To Ensure That “We Close Tax Loopholes To Companies Moving Jobs Overseas, And Making Them Invest Right Here In The United States.” OBAMA: “The fact of the matter is, it’s more fun being in the majority. You can get more stuff done. And to the extent that I can lend my assistance to these other candidates so that we can promote some of the policies that we’ve talked about: making sure that we close tax loopholes to companies moving jobs overseas, and making them invest right here in the United States. Then, I’m going to do everything I can to make that happen.” (State Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks In Illinois Senate Debate, Chicago, IL, 10/21/04) 2007: Obama Said “ That’s Why We’ve Got To Stop Giving Tax Breaks To Companies That Send Jobs Overseas.” OBAMA: “That’s why we’ve got to give unions the power to do what they do best, which is organize workers to lift themselves up into the middle class. That’s why we’ve got to stop giving tax breaks to companies that send jobs overseas. Save those tax breaks for companies that invest right here in the United States of America.” (Sen. Barack Obama, Remarks At Campaign Event, Columbus, OH, 10/26/07) 2008: Candidate Obama Again Presented His Economic Plan As One That Ends “Tax Breaks For Companies That Ship Our Jobs Overseas And Give Them To Companies That Create Jobs Here In America.” OBAMA: “At this defining moment in our history, the question is not, ‘Are you better off than you were four years ago’ – we all know the answer to that. The real question is, ‘will our country be better off four years from now?’ How will we lift our economy and restore America’s place in the world? Here’s what I’ll do as President. …I’ll end the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give them to companies that create jobs here in America.” (Obama For America Ad, “Barack Obama: Defining Moment,” 10/24/08)</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349694843503</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 07:14:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349695915121-10</Id><Topic><Title>The gay state likes their gas prices as big as possible, just like their peniisess!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349665699194</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 23:08:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You seem to be preoccupied with those big things, is there something else you want to tell us ??</Msg><Username>tocrazyright</Username><Timestamp>1349695915121</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 07:31:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349698863861-11</Id><Title>MIMV: Mobile apps search &amp; MSFT partner..............MIMV about to be bought out by MSFT....10 bagger....LINK</Title><Msg>SeekingAlpha on MSFT &amp; MIMV http://seekingalpha.com/article/906481-microsoft-partners-in-search-and-the-mobile-strategy-for-growth?source=email_rt_article_readmore&amp;ifp=0</Msg><Username>cashflow599</Username><Timestamp>1349698863861</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 08:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349702403374-12</Id><Title>Liberals lost the monopoly game in the first debate and threw out the board, dice, hotels motels etc.</Title><Msg>Seriously; how can a president who has never had to answer any hard questions, think on his feet, or be subjected to immediate criticism be expected to perform in a debate with a candidate who has existed with the opposite every day, by the press.</Msg><Username>deegory</Username><Timestamp>1349702403374</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 09:20:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349702433307-13</Id><Title>MIMV: Mobile apps search play...A MSFT partner that they are about to buy out...SeekingAlpha on it...LINK</Title><Msg>http://seekingalpha.com/article/906481-microsoft-partners-in-search-and-the-mobile-strategy-for-growth?source=email_rt_article_readmore&amp;ifp=0</Msg><Username>cashflow599</Username><Timestamp>1349702433307</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 09:20:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349702609910-14</Id><Topic><Title>Any idea which way MSFT will trade next week?</Title><Username>jermain.mcbride</Username><Timestamp>1349607076457</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-07 06:51:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a day trading service hI agree with his calls and also agree that he does provide a good service.

Bush while President Barack Obama is getting a free pass. “When George Bush was president, we heard about gas prices every time,” the former GOP presidential candidate said on Fox News’s “Fox &amp; Friends.” “And they would take cameras to the pumps and have someone almost tearfully explaining that they were paying almost two dollars and fifty cents a gallon. It’s amazing how quiet the media has been when gas prices are double what they were when President Obama took office. They’re the highest in the country’s history.” Continue Reading Text Size He cited California, where in some places gas has hit $6 a gallon — due in part to regulations and taxes, Huckabee said. “When that hits people, it hits them hard,” Huckabee said. “It takes that single mom trying to get to work, dropping her kids off at day care, that’s a gut-punch to Americans that I think they’ll remember on Election Day.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349717684700</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:34:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349717811372-30</Id><Topic><Title>Romney's foreign policy speech</Title><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1349709720929</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 11:22:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ObamaPhones Profiting ObamaDonors Program to aid the poor lining the pockets of the wealthy tracfone logo BY: Andrew Stiles October 8, 2012 5:00 am A wireless company profiting from the so-called “Obama phone” giveaway program is run by a prominent Democratic donor whose wife has raised more than $1.5 million for the president since 2007. Last week a video of a President Barack Obama supporter in Ohio claiming to have received a free phone from the president—“[Obama] gave us a phone!”—went viral, prompting media outlets to investigate. Since 1985 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has operated a program called Lifeline, originally designed to provide free landline phone service for low-income individuals. The government subsidizes telecommunications firms providing the service, and those firms also pass on costs to customers via the “Universal Service Charge” on their phone bills. The program expanded to include cell phones in 2008. That change has rapidly increased the cost to the federal government—$1.6 billion in 2011, up from $772 million in 2008. The number of Lifeline beneficiaries rose from 7.1 million to 12.5 million during the same period; cell phones account for roughly half of that 12.5 million.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1349717811372</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 13:36:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349718098424-31</Id><Title>Now we have voter fraud</Title><Msg>AND voter suppression from the republucans.

Microsoft is making large contributions to the open-source community it once clearly detested. By Duncan McLeod. Added by Duncan McLeod on 8 October 2012. Gianugo Rabellino A decade ago, Steve Ballmer described the free and open-source Linux operating system as a “cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches”. The famously boisterous Microsoft CEO was attacking the General Public Licence which governs much of the software code developed by the open-source community. But 10 years is a long time in the technology industry and if there’s one industry that evolves quickly it’s technology. Today the company is earning complements – even respect – from some of the leaders in open source, including Red Hat, the enterprise-focused open-source software developer.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1349720524842</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 14:22:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349720639972-39</Id><Topic><Title>Spam artists &amp; OT political posters</Title><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1349714625863</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 12:43:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's simple.

Last week a video of a President Barack Obama supporter in Ohio claiming to have received a free phone from the president—“[Obama] gave us a phone!”—went viral, prompting media outlets to investigate. Since 1985 the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has operated a program called Lifeline, originally designed to provide free landline phone service for low-income individuals. The government subsidizes telecommunications firms providing the service, and those firms also pass on costs to customers via the “Universal Service Charge” on their phone bills. The program expanded to include cell phones in 2008. That change has rapidly increased the cost to the federal government—$1.6 billion in 2011, up from $772 million in 2008. The number of Lifeline beneficiaries rose from 7.1 million to 12.5 million during the same period; cell phones account for roughly half of that 12.5 million.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1349722661051</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 14:57:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349723961787-49</Id><Title>THAT 7.8% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DROP LOOKS VERY GOOD FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA.</Title><Msg>Start weeping again Republicans.

Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick F. Kennedy -- who exercises responsibility for all department personnel, facilities, and operations, and who is one of the department's most respected civil servants, having served in his position under both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations -- delivered the assessment in an unclassified, half-hour conference call with staff aides to House and Senate lawmakers from relevant committees, and leadership offices, on the evening of Sept. 12. Capitol Hill sources described the call to Fox News. That a State Department official of Kennedy's rank -- one with direct oversight of the installations and people targeted in Benghazi -- reached so swiftly the conclusion that the attacks were premeditated and coordinated stands in stark contrast to the opposing narrative pressed at that time, and for several days afterward, by other top officials at State, the White House, and the intelligence agencies. Four days after Kennedy's conference call, for example, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice appeared on five Sunday morning talk shows to insist that the attacks were neither coordinated nor premeditated, but were rather the result of a spontaneous mob action, inspired by an anti-Muslim video on the Internet, that spun out of control. Rice has since told lawmakers that her comments reflected "the intelligence community's best, current assessment as of the date of my television appearances," and a spokesman to the Director of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper, has said in a statement that the intelligence community "revised our initial assessment to ... (conclude) that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists."</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349747843350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:57:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349747868382-78</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Lies: "President hasn't signed a free trade agreement."</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1349746909398</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:41:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney is a pathological liar.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1349747868382</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:57:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349749607860-79</Id><Topic><Title>Romney Lies: "President hasn't signed a free trade agreement."</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1349746909398</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:41:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Two Obamanurists on one post!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349749607860</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 22:26:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349749803854-80</Id><Title>Never got a clear count on the number of Obamanurists on this board.</Title><Msg>Please respond so I can get a clear count to determine if you are all as stupid, more stupid, or less stupid than the great Obamanure in chief.</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349749803854</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 22:30:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349750194682-81</Id><Topic><Title>Now, leftist Moes, ***THIS* is racism.
