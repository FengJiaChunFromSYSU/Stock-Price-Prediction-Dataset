Why not, they live here, they were enabled to make money here, why shouldn't they want to give from their excess? Not the widow and her mites to be expected to improve the nation. And the wealthy, great Americans they were just off WWII, paid. Now, not the same kind of patriots. Not all, but repub congress proves they just don't want to pay for what they have received.</Msg><Username>ghosanonon</Username><Timestamp>1364133960415</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 10:06:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364134602572-2</Id><Topic><Title>Here is the frustrating thing our clueless 'leader' can't seem to grasp</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1364076149596</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 18:02:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No play, just the facts. Obama is clueless, and anything but a leader. When you support the $800 billion dollar stimulus that he then admitted was a failure, and do it right after Bush turned a recession around, and then the 9-11 attack on top of the recession designed to destroy our economy...did it with tax CUTS that produced the longest, and strongest economy in American history....you are definitely clueless.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1364134602572</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 10:16:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364137289790-3</Id><Topic><Title>I would give that all that stashed cash away before I would let Obama spend it...</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1364094914832</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 23:15:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's the problem, and how wealthy America has changed.

Response to "Just remember Eisenhower" In the 1950s total government spending (fed, state and local) was in the high 20% of GDP area. Today total government spending is at 40% of GDP. And it was only a matter of a few years that Kennedy lowered that 91% to 70% (with just about the same loopholes). And when thinking about the 91% tax level, you have to understand the loopholes that existed and the inflation adjusted income levels that it applied to. (The loopholes were huge ... we would shake our heads in disbelief today if anyone cares to, or has the time, to understand them.)</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1364141814109</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 12:16:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364142832425-6</Id><Topic><Title>I would give that all that stashed cash away before I would let Obama spend it...</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1364094914832</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-23 23:15:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Today the average person in our government definition of poverty has the same standard of living as the average person had in the 1960s.

I don't think iWatch will sell with the aging population of baby boomers. First of all, you'll need tri-focal glasses to read the tiny screen. The screen on the iPhone is already too small for oldsters. Instead of trying to be cool, why doesn't Microsoft design a wearable computer for the aging population? How about a blood pressure monitor built into the device? How about an programable alarm/timer to remind the wearer to take his/her medications? How about a talking calendar to remind the user of doctor's appointments? A wearable medical computer for seniors would be more useful and Microsoft might get some kind of tax credit for producing it.</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1364180112423</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-24 22:55:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
