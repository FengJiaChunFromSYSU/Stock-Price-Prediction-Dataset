Darrell Issa is shown. | Jay Westcott/POLITICO 'Federal exchange subsidies may cost taxpayers in excess of $500 billion,' Issa said. | Jay Westcott/POLITICO By JASON MILLMAN | 10/26/12 5:33 PM EDT Updated: 10/26/12 7:14 PM EDT The Treasury Department, rejecting a subpoena threat from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, is citing executive branch “confidentiality interests” in its refusal to turn over documents on an IRS rule allowing subsidies in federal health insurance exchanges. “Obamacare” opponents argue that the law only allows subsidies to flow through state-run health exchanges — the new marketplaces for health insurance that are supposed to begin in 2014 — and that the IRS rule oversteps legal bounds. Under the law, the Department of Health and Human Services is supposed to set up federal exchanges in states that don’t build their own. Reid doing fine after car accident Agency officials this summer defended the rule before two House committees, contending that an entire reading of the law clearly intended for the subsidies to be available in federal exchanges, too. The Oversight panel had ordered the IRS and Treasury to turn over documents by Thursday that would shed light on how the agencies formed the legal basis for the subsidy rule. Instead, the Treasury claimed that the executive branch needs to keep those documents private. “It is well-established that agency staff and counsel must have the ability to engage in free, full, and unfettered discussions and debate about important policy and legal matters,” wrote Alastair Fitzpayne, Treasury assistant secretary for legislative affairs. “Accordingly, as the Executive Branch has long maintained, public disclosure of such material could have a significant chilling effect on agency staff and could inhibit their ability to fulfill their statutory responsibilities.” The Treasury letter asserts that the department’s interpretation should be settled “through the judicial process,” referencing a lawsuit that Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt filed against the IRS rule last month. Though the Oversight committee threatened a subpoena earlier this week, a Friday afternoon statement from Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) didn’t indicate how the panel would respond to Treasury’s refusal to turn over the documents. “Federal exchange subsidies may cost taxpayers in excess of $500 billion over the next decade,” Issa said. “The Administration’s refusal to shed light on the development of this half-trillion dollar extra-legal rule is stunning.”</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1351336832811</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 07:20:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351338693877-9</Id><Topic><Title>Just watched the Surface show...</Title><Username>beauzero</Username><Timestamp>1351189480283</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:24:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Only a developer will use a Linux.

What is this thing? Ultrabooks have nicer screens, weigh about as much (maybe less), have faster procs / graphics chips, better screens, and far more applications. The Surface needs its own compiled apps and is not directly compatible with the desktop version of Windows 8 (but, at the same time, IS essentially Windows 8)? The thing is a brick. Plus, the power attachment looks the same as the keyboard adapter (I couldn't figure out how to charge the thing). Now, don't laugh, but this is another big problem. With the removal of Flash, it doesn't support the major adult websites (youp0rn, p0rnhub, etc.). This is a HUGE part of the tablet market. Metro is exactly that: a blue and purple pile of puke. IMO, this is the UGLIEST UI EVER in the history of computing. I'm going hard core short M$FT on Monday. IMO, Windows 8 is a disaster that will make Vista look like a massive success.</Msg><Username>sillymuppets</Username><Timestamp>1351355168524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:26:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351355864155-37</Id><Topic><Title>Surface is a joke</Title><Username>sillymuppets</Username><Timestamp>1351355168524</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:26:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>-I got mine yesterday.-Oh you will soon &amp; really did your homework as well before buying(LOL) short &amp; surf porn &amp; your other intellectual pursuits at will troll...................................................</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1351355864155</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 12:37:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351356157920-38</Id><Topic><Title>400 people at Bellevue msft store</Title><Username>dscmsunw</Username><Timestamp>1351301941043</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-26 21:39:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you're not an MS employee, which I doubt, you are either a "partner" shilling for them or an agency employee working on their "social marketing" tactics.

Unfortunately for him, the economy is the issue people care about most. The President’s record is one of hype and hope trumped by reality. The GDP growth we were promised is less than half of what we’ve gotten. We have a record number of people on food stamps and have averaged 975 people per day, 8.8 million in total, being added to the Social Security disability rolls. The only reason the unemployment rate has dropped is because people have given up hope of finding work and are no longer counted. To call the Obama record on the economy a failure is an indictment of the English language that simply hasn’t created a strong enough word to accurately convey the gap between what we were sold and what we got. The President’s response? Binders, Big Bird and birth control.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1351363305838</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 14:41:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351367260292-49</Id><Topic><Title>Go to Youtube and watch CIA head, Michael Scheuer, nail the Kenyan to the barn door</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351342031575</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 08:47:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NICE POST, OBAMMAS_10_IQ!!!!

I upgraded my laptop to Windows 8 and played with it for several hours. There are 2 types of apps, traditional desktop and Microsoft Store apps. They all run on the laptop. The Microsoft Store apps GUI are modern and fresh. I was going to wait for the Surface Pro tablet to be able to run all the traditional desktop apps but I now think the Surface RT tablet is fine now since I like the Microsoft Store apps much better.</Msg><Username>bhtt</Username><Timestamp>1351375891447</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 18:11:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351376356927-68</Id><Title>Obamma rallying all of his black people</Title><Msg>Musllims here and all around the world support Hussein including Iran's dictator, Mahoud Ahmadinejad.

This, along with the Kenyan's destruction of the United States and myriad of murders will bring the D mon ick dictator down. Obamma danced on the graves of the 4 Americans while he waved his phony video around in the air spreading his propaganda lies and cover up. Was it Romney running around saying Benghazi was a Sunday afternoon rally gone wrong because of some 2 bit video and that it wasn't a terrorist attack and that he's really disgusted and upset that his prophet Muhammmed was offended,... OR, was it Romney that said IMMEDIATELY that it was IN FACT a terrorist attack and told the TRUTH to the American people? You know the truth, it's that thing that the commie left endlessly tries to suppress. Tenn. Congresswoman, Marsha Blackburn, wants to bring impeachment proceedings against the blood thirsty lying Musllim monkey. SHE is an American PATRIOT! And the Kenyan, is a SPY.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351394007545</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 23:13:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351394615007-83</Id><Title>4 Americans would be alive today if Obamma wasn't a psychotic warmonger that attacked Libya.</Title><Msg>And so would FIFTY THOUSAND INNOCENT WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
