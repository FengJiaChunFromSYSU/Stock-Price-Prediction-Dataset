He has spent more time vacationing and golfing than being a leader. During the Gulf oil spill he did nothing. In crisis after crisis he does nothing - except vacation, play golf, and campaign to save his own sorry behind. He is useless as a leader and this country would have been significantly better off if he had never been elected.

That’s a pocketbook issue for women and families all across the country, and it makes a difference in terms of how well and effectively women are able to work. This has long been a Democratic talking point. Back in July, Senator Barbara Mikulski proclaimed: One of the most important tools we women have is mammograms. But in the midst of the healthcare debate, they [Republicans] wanted to take our mammograms away from us. But, well, hey, not while I’m here! But Planned Parenthood, with few exceptions, does not provide mammograms. To test the president’s statement in the real world, I called several Planned Parenthood offices in the New York City area today to ask about scheduling a mammogram. “We actually don’t offer that here,” one office told me. “You might want to call 311, they actually have lists of places you could go to.” When I asked, “You don’t provide them like the president said?,” I was told “No.” Another office told me the following: “We don’t do mammograms, but I could definitely give you other places you could call.” When I mentioned the president’s statement, the woman said, “I’m not even sure because we’ve never offered mammograms.” Of the five offices I called, only the Hempstead, N.Y., location said it offered the service — on Fridays and not by an in-house technician. Listen to several of the calls below.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1350572473320</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:01:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350572577164-29</Id><Title>UNEMPLOY..... again 8,1% . 46,0000 more peaple filed unempl... benefits last week</Title><Msg>388,000 filed for 1-time.</Msg><Username>mishaelena</Username><Timestamp>1350572577164</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:02:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350572800267-30</Id><Topic><Title>Planned Parenhood staff says "The president is wrong, we don't provide mammograms</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1350572473320</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:01:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many right wing extremists say if they get control of the government, they will outlaw a women's right to choose no matter what the circumstances of the pregnancy...</Msg><Username>therwnjneedhelp</Username><Timestamp>1350572800267</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:06:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350572800579-31</Id><Topic><Title>Planned Parenhood staff says "The president is wrong, we don't provide mammograms</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1350572473320</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:01:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Many right wing extremists say if they get control of the government, they will outlaw a women's right to choose no matter what the circumstances of the pregnancy...</Msg><Username>therwnjneedhelp</Username><Timestamp>1350572800579</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:06:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350573098597-32</Id><Title>Guess for tomorrows opening price..</Title><Msg>I say high 27's - on the way back to inescapable 25's..</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1350573098597</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:11:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350573210604-33</Id><Topic><Title>Isn't it pathetic that these wipes have nothing better to harp on than the Benghazi thing.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1350566364286</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 09:19:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's already been told to them to stop it by the parents of the dead.

That would encourage more Americans to build cash nest eggs and to own stocks and bonds above and beyond their retirement plans.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1350574421099</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:33:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350574648330-38</Id><Topic><Title>Planned Parenhood staff says "The president is wrong, we don't provide mammograms</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1350572473320</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 11:01:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who cares what people say who have no say.

They are, after all, trying to win our votes. But when Mitt Romney talks about women, when he says he believes that we can do any job a man can do, I know from experience that he's speaking from the heart. I served as Lt. Governor with Mitt Romney when he was Governor of Massachusetts. In fact, of the twenty top positions in the Romney administration, ten of them were filled by women, more than any other state in the nation. Romney's Chief of Staff was a woman - Beth Myers. As we took office, our administration actively sought to recruit the best and brightest women the Commonwealth had to offer. And Governor Romney wasn't just checking a box. He sought out our counsel, and he listened to our advice. We didn't always agree, but we were always respected. Mitt Romney didn't judge the people who were in his administration by their gender. He wanted the best, male or female. There's no greater evidence that Mitt Romney will represent all Americans than his record of treating all people fairly and impartially. His was a brand of leadership that got things done by bringing people together, not dividing them. We need that kind of leadership today. People are hurting in this country, and women especially have been suffering. The numbers are stark. Five-and-a-half million women are unemployed. Under President Obama, the number of women living in poverty has climbed to a record high of nearly twenty-six million. Despite President Obama's best efforts -- and despite his soaring rhetoric -- his policies simply haven't worked. In the two debates we have seen so far, we've heard the President give excuses for his disappointments, but we haven't heard him offer a specific plan or concrete proposals detailing how the next four years will be any different than the last four years. We can't afford four more years of the status quo. What we need is change, and that is precisely what Governor Romney is offering. He has a plan that will create twelve million new jobs, one that will get our economy moving again and lift Americans back out of poverty. He'll do it by offering strong leadership and by working across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats. I know that he can accomplish these goals because I have seen him do it before. And when he does succeed, millions of women will have good jobs with rising pay and new opportunities to fulfill their dreams. That is the kind of empowerment and equality that we need now more than ever. Watch this video and show your support for Mitt Romney -- contribute today.

The latest figures are calculated in a report out Thursday by the California-based Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS) and likely underestimate the problem in some ways because they don't include most graduates of for-profit colleges, who typically borrow more than their counterparts elsewhere. Still, while 2011 college graduates faced an unemployment rate of 8.8 percent in 2011, even those with debt remained generally better off than those without a degree. The report emphasized research showing that the economic returns on college degrees remain, in general, strong. It noted the unemployment rate for those with only a high school credential last year was 19.1 percent. "In these tough times, a college degree is still your best bet for getting a job and decent pay," said TICAS President Lauren Asher. "But, as debt levels rise, fear of loans can prevent students from getting the education they need to succeed. Students and parents need to know that, even at similar looking schools, debt levels can be wildly different. And, if they do need to borrow to get through school, federal student loans, with options like income-based repayment, are the safest way to go." The latest figures come at a time of increasing alarm about the sheer scope of student debt nationally, which by some measures has surpassed $1 trillion. Recent government figures show nearly 10 percent of borrowers of federal student loans in the most recently measured cohort had already defaulted within two years of starting repayment.

The latest figures are calculated in a report out Thursday by the California-based Institute for College Access and Success (TICAS) and likely underestimate the problem in some ways because they don't include most graduates of for-profit colleges, who typically borrow more than their counterparts elsewhere. Still, while 2011 college graduates faced an unemployment rate of 8.8 percent in 2011, even those with debt remained generally better off than those without a degree. The report emphasized research showing that the economic returns on college degrees remain, in general, strong. It noted the unemployment rate for those with only a high school credential last year was 19.1 percent. "In these tough times, a college degree is still your best bet for getting a job and decent pay," said TICAS President Lauren Asher. "But, as debt levels rise, fear of loans can prevent students from getting the education they need to succeed. Students and parents need to know that, even at similar looking schools, debt levels can be wildly different. And, if they do need to borrow to get through school, federal student loans, with options like income-based repayment, are the safest way to go." The latest figures come at a time of increasing alarm about the sheer scope of student debt nationally, which by some measures has surpassed $1 trillion. Recent government figures show nearly 10 percent of borrowers of federal student loans in the most recently measured cohort had already defaulted within two years of starting repayment.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350580514835</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 13:15:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350580633142-65</Id><Topic><Title>Team Obama pulled out of FL, NC &amp; VA!!!</Title><Username>caliente.zorra</Username><Timestamp>1350579741389</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 13:02:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>osted at 12:42 PM ET, 10/18/2012 Obama lacks an agenda to compensate for his record By Jennifer Rubin For some time now Jim Pethokoukis of the American Enterprise Institute has been comparing President Obama’s “recovery” with that of other presidents. Liberal economists have pushed back, trying to claim this specific type of recession (financial meltdown) is especially prolonged. But putting the word play aside, Pethokoukis has noted with some handy charts that the “recovery” under Obama has been the worst going back to the mid-19th century. Pethokoukis has an odd ally, the former Obama car czar Steve Rattner. It is not every day that the Romney camp sends out clips from MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” or quotes Obama advisers, but this segment is deadly: As the MSNBC panel elucidated, you’d have to back to the 1930s to find a worst period of economic growth. Moreover, we are doing worse in October 2012 than we were in December 2010 or March 2012. There is something very wrong. Obama’s serial attacks on Mitt Romney’s economic plans have fallen flat in large part because the president’s own economic management is so putrid and because he lacks something that can be characterized as a meaty pro-growth, pro-jobs plan. Many voters in essence are concluding: Okay, we hear your attacks Mr. President, but you’ve got nothing. We should try this other guy. The media dwelled for weeks on the Romney campaign’s dilemma as to whether this could be a referendum election or a choice election. Romney managed to make it a choice election. Ironically, Obama hadn’t prepared by presenting a weighty agenda of his own. Whatever the faults of Romney’s agenda, he has one. The president’s failure to disqualify his opponent, and his media allies’ hounding Romney to come up with an agenda, were the perfect storm; now Romney has an agenda many voters like, and Obama risks being blown off the stage.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350580633142</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 13:17:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350581042723-66</Id><Title>28 after hours.............

Hillary Clinton trashes whiners Clinton, in the interview with Marie Claire, was discussing Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former director of policy planning at the State Department who left in 2011. This summer, Slaughter wrote a much-discussed cover story in the Atlantic - “Why Women Still Can’t Have It all” - about leaving her job because of the difficulty of balancing her work at State with the needs of her two teenage boys. “I can’t stand whining,” Clinton told Marie Claire. “I can’t stand the kind of paralysis that some people fall into because they’re not happy with the choices they’ve made. You live in a time when there are endless choices … Money certainly helps, and having that kind of financial privilege goes a long way, but you don’t even have to have money for it. But you have to work on yourself … Do something!” Clinton added, “Some women are not comfortable working at the pace and intensity you have to work at in these jobs … Other women don’t break a sweat…They have four or five, six kids. They’re highly organized, they have very supportive networks.” (See also: PHOTOS: Hillary Clinton's style) Slaughter, who is now a professor at Princeton University, is traveling and couldn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Clinton wasn’t totally unsympathetic toward issues raised her former employee. “It’s important for our workplaces … to be more flexible and creative in enabling women to continue to do high-stress jobs while caring for not only children, but [also] aging parents,” Clinton said. In the Marie Claire interview, Clinton also said once again that she has no desire to run for president in 2016.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1350586107470</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:48:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350586171288-84</Id><Topic><Title>Conservative Media Now Uses Other Polls.....</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1350583712848</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:08:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney Spokesperson Mocks MSNBC For Paying Men More Than Women, Andrea Mitchell Agrees video by Noah Rothman | 2:11 pm, October 18th, 2012 » 10 comments Speaking with MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell on Thursday, senior adviser to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign, Barbara Comstock, was asked about Romney’s position on the Lilly Ledbetter Act. Comstock said it was clear that there were pay inequality issues, and cited MSNBC who she says pays their male employees more than their female employees. Mitchell agreed with Comstock that this was the case. “For Lilly Ledbetter, this was not just a legal issue,” Mitchell explained to Comstock. “This was the fact that she was not permitted to sue for equal pay because the statue had run out and the law said, if you didn’t know the men you were working with were making more money, which many of us don’t know – we don’t have access to those confidential…” “We know here at MSNBC the guys get paid more,” Comstock interjected. “We certainly do,” Mitchell replied.

Unlike a recent joint appearance on the show by President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama during which questioning ranged from how romantic is the president to the couple's anniversary, the show's five hosts skipped the softball questions and got right into red meat — including military service, abortion and the Romneys' Mormon faith. When the Obamas' appearance aired on Sept. 25, the panel stuck to questions about the First Couple's 20th wedding anniversary and whether or not President Obama is "romantic," though they did query Obama lightly about the murder of U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, which the president declined to characterize at the time as an act of terrorism. Romney, 63, clad in a red dress and gold jewelry, was initially scheduled to appear with her husband, who backed out citing a scheduling conflict, according to host Barbara Walters. But his wife deftly deflected her husband's description of the female klatch as "sharp-tongued," saying the candidate called the women "sharp and young." Moments later, Goldberg asked Romney if her husband's Mormon faith precluded him or their five sons from serving in the military and whether the Romneys would be prepared to console relatives of fallen U.S. soldiers. Many Mormons serve in the military and the faith does not bar them from doing so. “What I know is I am here to reflect the character of the person I know." - Ann Romney, appearing on "The View" “He was serving his mission and my five sons also served [on] missions,” Ann Romney replied. “We find different ways of serving.” Asked how she would explain to relatives of the fallen soldiers that her sons did not serve in the U.S. military, she continued, "I would say it’s the hardest thing that a president and a first lady can do. We have the most extraordinary fighting men and women and we have to be grateful for them.” Walters grilled Romney on abortion, and stem cell research, but noted she is not the one running for office.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1350588247584</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:24:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350588304030-93</Id><Topic><Title>Count Baracula is a blood thiirsty anti American commie</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350586735179</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 14:58:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>His family escaped to mexico so they can have sister-wives!

It has a feature called MAPS which determines how much information you want the program to send Microsoft.

In that short period of time the adware popup windows that were setting off the anti-virus and crashing the browser have been converted to popups with an error message that says the network connection was lost, so it appears to really pay to share as much information with Microsoft as they feel they need.</Msg><Username>david_a_rankin</Username><Timestamp>1350588818290</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 15:33:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350589261782-96</Id><Title>BLACK VOTERS</Title><Msg>Black voters are now telling BO being (8%black) isn't enough.

However, Intel’s poor sales may indicate computer makers aren’t expecting to build that many machines in the quarter ending in December.

The world's largest software maker said a “new era” will begin for the company when it launches Windows 8 this fall. “Investments we’ve made over a number of years are now coming together to create a future of exceptional devices and services, with tremendous opportunity for our customers, developers, and partners,” CEO Steve Ballmer said. However, soft PC sales that use its software weighed on year-over-year results. The Redmond, Wash.-based software maker posted net income of $5.31 billion, or 53 cents a share, down from a year ago. Excluding one-time items, though, Microsoft said it earned $6.6 billion, or 65 cents a share, topping average analyst estimates of 56 cents in a Thomson Reuters poll. Revenue, adjusted for special items, for the three months ended Sept. 30 was $17.36 billion, down from the prior-year period. Unadjusted revenue was $16 billion.</Msg><Username>lws2000</Username><Timestamp>1350600600970</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:50:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350601656380-177</Id><Topic><Title>WITHOUT NOKIA, MSFT IS A HORSE #$%$!</Title><Username>shep543</Username><Timestamp>1350600228860</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 18:43:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nokia is going b/k ...Can't you see that?

Read If it occurs — and we’re within a whisker of it — this would be the first time we’ll have seen the 50-month and 200-month moving averages cross in the S&amp;P 500 in more than six decades. However, unlike 65 years ago, this cross is in the bear camp. Take a look at the chart below. In simple terms, a bearish cross is when the 50- and 200-month simple moving averages “flip” — or get inverted. When the shorter term 50-month moving average (ie. RED LINE) crosses above the longer term 200-month (BLUE LINE), it’s referred to as a “death cross” and is confirmed on volume.

Since #$%$uming the CEO position Ballmer has managed to completely miss the boat on every fast-growing segment of consumer technology - search, mobile computing, smartphones, social networking, digital music, etc. etc. etc. - while coasting on the Windows and Office franchises as they slowly slide into irrelevance. Kin.Bing. That ad company they bought and wrote off. Ballmer's tenure has been marked by one failed gambit after another. And now on deck we have the Surface, a thin computer with a keyboard attached. Say, doesn't that sound an awful lot like...AN UNDERPOWERED NOTEBOOK?!? A misbegotten design powered by an operating system nobody will know how to use out of the box. Sure sounds like a winner to me, Steve. Not. You won't sell five million this quarter, nor four nor three nor two. This will go he way of HP's tablet, on the discount rack within months. It's a shame that MSFT is not small enough for a Carl Icahn or Daniel Loeb to buy a sizable share, then start kicking #$%$ and taking names. MSFT needs nothing more badly than a shock to the system. Canning Ballmer and giving the entire board he heave-ho would be a good start. Until something like that happens, expect nothing from this stock.</Msg><Username>ptuttle2012</Username><Timestamp>1350606083244</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 20:21:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350606294236-207</Id><Title>The Musllim said to Romeny,...

Also go to Snopes and look at the photo's of the Kenyan's hoar mother in the rude nude showing her wares. Just click on the pics to see the pig. Snopes, a year after showing the 3 photos of Stanley the pig, decided to run interference for the Kenyan and put a disclaimer in the link saying that the photos are really that of a burlesque stripper, Marcy Moore, but if you look at the pictures it's PLAIN TO SEE that's it's the Musllim's pig mother and NOT Marcy Moore. Stanley Ann's #$%$ are not nearly as big as Marcy's not to mention they look NOTHING alike. Romney should show the photos and bring up Larry Sinclair,.... but not like Barry 'brings him up'.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350611730678</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-18 21:55:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350611830191-255</Id><Topic><Title>Romney is TEARING the Kenyan up at the Alfred E.
