Nobody's buying a Surface except those who get paycheck from MSFT. And the reason is that like always Microsoft isn't operating on a vision but simply copying a successful product. A finger-touch screen was Apple's idea and they have thought it through. Also good old Microsoft is still relying on MS Office to attract younger generation to their products, and getting no traction with them. Maybe a little with guys in their 50s. They need to reinvent cool. Bill Gates and Ballmer isn't going to do it. Get some new young CEO and reinvent the company or be doomed. Watching MSFT come up with products like Surface and Zune and that giant table is like seeing your grandpa try to rap. It's embarrassing, please stop it.</Msg><Username>atul_prasad</Username><Timestamp>1351492618321</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 02:36:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351492892590-5</Id><Topic><Title>Have any Surfaces sold?</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1351389213473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 21:53:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BTW do you know iPad mini is available in stores from Nov 2.

When he put his hands on the face of the mother of the slain State Dept. worker in Benghazi and told her they would tell her the truth, she said she knew then he was lying and didn't trust him. Probably because the truth is already known and SHE knows it too, there's only ONE person that gives the okay to go in to save their lives or to abandon them in their critical SEVEN HOURS of need and we ALL know who that is,..... and it ain't Bush and it ain't Romney because if it was either one of them they would have sent in the troops and air support and they would be alive today. It looks like Panetta sold out to the commie Kenyan's corrupt regime and his only hope is to try and come clean. I'm not betting he will, it would take too much courage, the kind of courage that the Navy SEALS had who RAN into harm's way to save their fellow Americans. That #$%$ about the military not going in because they didn't know what was going on and it might me dangerous is a flat out bold faced disgusting anti American cowardly gutless self serving LIE by none other than the Liar in Thief, Hussein. The mother, Mrs. Smith, said that Hillary and Obamma lied to her too at the military service where they received the bodies of the 4 dead men at the air force base. Someone's going to crack, it's either going to be Panetta or one of the military rats involved in the cover up and don't be surprised to see someone involved in the cover up commit suicide because they have Benghazi-Gate blood on their hands like Hillary, Hussein, Carney, Holder, Rice, Soros, Jarret, Biden et. al.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351511024943</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 07:43:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351511866010-11</Id><Title>The reason that the American men went in to save their brothers when told to "Stand down"</Title><Msg>....... is because they knew NO AMERICAN gave that order.

But which approach, Apple’s or Microsoft’s is the better one? Microsoft’s is definitely the braver strategy; the company must know it’ll make users uncomfortable with a change this significant. It has included the same desktop users will recognize, which some have seen as not going far enough, but this is still a very aggressive play by Microsoft, and one that should prepare users for the final step of doing away with told paradigm altogether next time around. Apple, on the other hand, is slowly making over its desktop experience, in a way that should ease the transition for users, but will ultimately keep desktop and mobile computing as distinct experiences for a lot longer. But users might reward it for that kind of hand-holding, by sticking around through the process and even bringing new users into the fold as things progress gradually, while Microsoft sheds some users thanks to its more abrupt shift.</Msg><Username>larrybright29</Username><Timestamp>1351524106651</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 11:21:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351524204094-23</Id><Title>Everybody comparing APPLE and Window 8 will prefer Window 8 as long as you are</Title><Msg>willing to invest a little in learning a bit.

The Romney campaign is attacking Wisconsin hard, and is already showing a two-point advantage in the state. White House spokesman Jay Carney explained the president's choice, "It's essential in his view that he be in Washington, one of the areas that will be affected, and where his team is to oversee that effort." Obama is choosing to show leadership in a potential disaster situation rather than campaign in this battleground state. Obama knows that the country is watching him closely right before the election and Hurricane Sandy is arriving at large population centers right as Americans are deciding who to vote for. Obama has also canceled his appearance today in Orlando with former president Bill Clinton to stay in Washington. Romney and Ryan just finished three joint-rallies in Ohio and are now attacking Wisconsin because they know that they absolutely need one of these states to win the election. Romney is no doubt aware that he too cannot appear nonchalant in the face of the hurricane, but he is not the leader of the country and so the eyes of the nation are locked tightly on Obama.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1351533425519</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 13:57:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351533564713-33</Id><Topic><Title>Which stocks Billionaires Love?</Title><Username>rightdon53</Username><Timestamp>1348905639453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 04:00:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good Luck to NY</Msg><Username>cris.chest</Username><Timestamp>1351533564713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 13:59:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351533985844-34</Id><Topic><Title>Is Mitt Romney planning to abolish FEMA if elected as Pres.</Title><Username>drstonecool</Username><Timestamp>1351524517940</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 11:28:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>looks like U lose again creek.

Well, she wasn't counting on anyone finding out that it was her, Holder and Hussein THAT WERE DOING IT. Hussein, Holder and Hillary are doing all they can to disarm the U.S. because you can't control a people, if they're ARMED. And when their communist plot to frame Americans for THEIR crimes backfired, all the Musllim did was simply, SEAL THE RECORDS,............ that of course, incriminated the whole commie lot of them. Odd that only the F&amp;F whistle blower American Patriots are the only ones being punished but not the criminals like the head of the ATF, Melson, who because of his promised silence was relocated to some cushy desk job counting paper clips for 300K a year at at tax payer expense. And others were given overseas assignments to ensure their silence. And as for the other culprits, they're still in the WHITE HOUSE. Ps. The Kenyan already hurried up and sealed the Benghazi videos that will send him to the gallows and there's no amount of money Donald Trump can offer the Musllim for him to release ALL of his records and videos for the aforementioned reason.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351535033600</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:23:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351535128410-38</Id><Topic><Title>WINDOWS 8 stinks!

I've been saying this for years, but this email probably explains it better and more clearly. This is NOT a political message, but rather a clarification to remind us all of the correct facts. Remember that on October 9, 2007, 11 months before our "economic crisis" occurred (that was actually created), the Dow hit its highest point ever, closing at 14,164.53 and reaching 14,198.10 intra-day level. 2 days later. Unemployment was steady at 4.7%. But things were already being put in place to create the havoc we've all been experiencing since then. And it all started, as this email explains, on January 3, 2007. This tells the story, why Bush was so "bad" at the end of his term. The day the Democrats took over was not January 22nd 2009, it was actually January 3rd 2007, which was the day the Democrats took over the House of Representatives and the Senate, at the very start of the 110th Congress. The Democrat Party controlled a majority in both chambers for the first time since the end of the 103rd Congress in 1995. For those who are listening to the liberals propagating the fallacy that everything is "Bush's Fault", think about this: January 3rd, 2007 was the day the Democrats took over the Senate and the Congress. At the time: The DOW Jones closed at 12,621.77 The GDP for the previous quarter was 3.5% The Unemployment rate was 4.6% George Bush's Economic policies SET A RECORD of 52 STRAIGHT MONTHS of JOB GROWTH Remember the day... January 3rd, 2007 was the day that Barney Frank took over the House Financial Services Committee and Chris Dodd took over the Senate Banking Committee. The economic meltdown that happened 15 months later was in what part of the economy? BANKING AND FINANCIAL SERVICES! Unemployment... to this CRISIS by (among MANY other things) dumping 5-6 TRILLION Dollars of toxic loans on the economy from YOUR Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac FIASCOES! Bush asked Congress 17 TIMES to stop Fannie &amp; Freddie - starting in 2001 because it was financially risky for the US economy. And who took the THIRD highest pay-off from Fannie Mae AND Freddie Mac? OBAMA And who fought against reform of Fannie and Freddie? OBAMA and the Democrat Congress. So when someone tries to blame Bush. REMEMBER JANUARY 3rd, 2007.... THE DAY THE DEMOCRATS TOOK OVER!" Budgets do not come from the White House. They come from Congress and the party that controlled Congress since January 2007 is the Democrat Party. Furthermore, the Democrats controlled the budget process for 2008 &amp; 2009 as well as 2010 &amp; 2011. In that first year, they had to contend with George Bush, which caused them to compromise on spending, when Bush somewhat belatedly got tough on spending increases. For 2009 though, Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid bypassed George Bush entirely, passing continuing resolutions to keep government running until Barack Obama could take office. At that time, they passed a massive omnibus spending bill to complete the 2009 budgets. And where was Barack Obama during this time? He was a member of that very Congress that passed all of these massive spending bills, and he signed the omnibus bill as President to complete 2009. If the Democrats inherited any deficit, it was the 2007 deficit, the last of the Republican budgets. That deficit was the lowest in five years, and the fourth straight decline in deficit spending. After that, Democrats in Congress took control of spending, and that includes Barack Obama, who voted for the budgets. If Obama inherited anything, he inherited it from himself. In a nutshell, what Obama is saying is I inherited a deficit that I voted for and then I voted to expand that deficit four-fold since January 20th.</Msg><Username>free2491</Username><Timestamp>1351535524511</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:32:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351535708845-42</Id><Topic><Title>screwshi8tn is so dumb he thinks there are commies left over in this world from the cold war --now that is stoooopid</Title><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351533186033</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 13:53:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>According to this definition of communism, one doesn't have to look any farther than the White House for commies: 2. Communism a. A system of government in which the state plans and controls the economy and a single, often authoritarian party holds power, claiming to make progress toward a higher social order in which all goods are equally shared by the people. b. The Marxist-Leninist version of Communist doctrine that advocates the overthrow of capitalism by the revolution of the proletariat. Obama hates everyone who actually "built that" and he is the authoritarian party holding power. He wants to"share the wealth" just like the definition says "good are equally shared by the people".

The junkie jihadist hounded him for coke and #$%$. And he got both. Frank Marshall Davis was his Marxist mentor in the Musllim monkey's very early days, Davis was a commie activist and poet.

He has murdered one too many Americans as he did in Benghazi for political expediency and tries to cover it up and still goes on his leftist commie talk shows and laughs like a school girl as though nothing happened and even goes so far as to fancy himself "eye candy" after he just murdered 4 Americans in Benghazi and 3 American border agents along the Mexican border. Most people hit an animal on the road and it altars their lives forever but that e vill thing murders with reckless abandon and then laughs like an e vill happy go lucky jackal with the blood still dripping from his hands. That's probably what endears his fascist left commie followers to him.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351548488671</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 18:08:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351548593356-94</Id><Topic><Title>Storm will flood New York and once the power goes out,</Title><Username>chaosanddiscontent</Username><Timestamp>1351536566800</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 14:49:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah but how many liberals can the high ground hold.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351548593356</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 18:09:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351548957095-95</Id><Topic><Title>All one needs to know about Obama and Libya is that Obama</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1351547076331</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-29 17:44:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's just as plain and sad for America simple as that.

The reason that the Kenyan concocted his crazy cover up for his crimes is that he is guilty with the blood of 4 Americans dripping from his hands and there's NOT an excuse in the world that he can use, simply because there isn't one. And that p o s has an excuse for EVERYTHING. There's no reason on God's green earth that the military should not have been sent in to save those men. NONE. Those SEALS were the real heroes for running to danger and saving over 30 people and the military that STOOD DOWN, KNOWING, that those Americans were in peril fighting for their very lives are cowards and traitors. I think we will see some military personnel commit suicide over this because they stood down as per the Musllim's orders and watched them DIE in terror, ust like Hussein and Hillary did, but they don't care, all they care about is power, prestige and going to Vegas and on the View.
