It is a sign that the US Government cannot pay its own bills.

Increasing America 's debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership means that, "the buck stops here.' Instead, Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better.

You can't. Federal lands were being held in leases without being used for oil production. The govt under Obama is getting new leases so the lands CAN be used. The spin you believe is hyped up from snipped words and lies to mean the opposite of the truth. Obama is INCREASING oil production on govt lands with his actions. Just put those listening ears on to reality, not just your faux news brainwashing sessions. Really it's true, get away from that crap, all they do is manufacture stories to inflame their base. The election is OVER. Obama is not campaigning for election, that's done. He is campaigning for us, the middle class, against what is becoming an American aristocracy, controlled by unelected lobbyists, not a democracy.

The stock price is down at $26. Microsoft is doing something wrong, and has been doing something wrong for over 10 years. I think Bill stepped down, sat on the board for years and put lackluster people in charge. Bill made his money, so what the heck does he care? He'll use his charitable deductions to save on taxes. Also Microsoft software still has a good business market. So, Microsoft will go along, year after year, incrementally peddling its popular business software and XBox. I agree with Wall Street observers that Microsoft is too big and needs to start spinning off extra weight so that it could compete with the "cloud".
