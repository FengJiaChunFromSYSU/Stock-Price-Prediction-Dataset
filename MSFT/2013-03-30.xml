Quoting: "The Linux Foundation has released the results of a new survey of IT staffers at enterprises with more than 500 employees and more than $500 million in annual revenue. It found that large enterprises are increasing their investment in Linux for the third year in a row and that Linux is particularly important to companies that are adopting cloud computing or implementing big data projects. "PCWorld's Katherine Noyesreported, "The past two years have already seen significant jumps in corporate Linux usage, but now it looks like that trend is continuing into a third year. To wit: While overall server revenue grew at just 3.1 percent and Windows server revenue increased just 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 year-over-year, Linux experienced 12.7 percent year-over-year growth for the same period. Unix, meanwhile, was down 24.1 percent. That's according to the Linux Foundation, which on Wednesday released its 2013 Enterprise End User Report, focusing on Linux adoption." " _______________________________________________ These results are open to the charge of bias, considering who conducted the survey, but interesting nevertheless.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1364677026825</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 16:57:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364677733879-19</Id><Topic><Title>Enterprise Linux Adoption Continues to Increase</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1364677026825</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 16:57:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No doubt.

I would not expect you to know this since you have demonstrated primarily type one thinking. Under the influence of type one thinking you see things as good or bad depending on whatever threshold happens to be be in your concept of normal. Any serious criticism of a policy requires several plausible superior paths. Get back to us when you can demonstrate a plausble alternate path for the economy that results in a better situation. Of course 'better' has to be defined. Most reasonable people define a policy as 'better' if it raises the expected standard of living of the population. So with this metric please do reply with your proposed policy and analysis of why your chosen metric is better that under current policy.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1364694380069</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-30 21:46:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364694670109-38</Id><Topic><Title>Hawcreek is really David Robert Watkins of St Pete florida.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1364607864456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 21:44:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>[[And as to "reporting you" I told you before, you're not worth the time.]] Really ??
