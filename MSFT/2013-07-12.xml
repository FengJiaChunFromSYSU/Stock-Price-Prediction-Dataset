I can't imagine sitting in my easy chair trading stocks 6.5 hours a day and reaching over the key board punching a touch screen all day, scheeeeech, I'd be exhausted. Flipping my mouse is much easier to use than a touch screen and many of the trading features are set up using macros programmed in both the key board and mouse.

We think the restructuring to focus on devices and services is overdue and where the computing market is today, and therefore view it as a needed move by MSFT. Our concern, however, is that it will take time for the restructuring to take hold and bear fruit. So while needed, we see the realignment adding execution risk to revenues and earnings./B.

No evidence to that, and you weren't there to witness it. Georgey is a proven liar, and what happened is unknown, except a child was killed by a man with a gun. No way Georgey couldn't fight back. I could easily defend myself against that boy. Georgey didn't try hard at all. according to his own statements, he was almost a mannikin. But he had that gun, which is why he is totally guilty. He did not need to kill that child. If he could have put in some of his own fighting in his stories, it would have been more believable. If not found guilty,it means anyone you meet on the street has the right to say they think you are a threat in their mind, and kill you with their concealed weapon.

When there is a slow media time, such as after the World Series, then you'll see Wall Street TRY to grab some headlines with violent market "swings" (contrived, of course), which is a LOL unto itself. Another laugh is how the media are led by the nose by these planned-out moves, often are caught off-guard and sound stupid as they are being duped. Memo To Wall Street: Who cares? It's all a CROCK.</Msg><Username>ifpigscouldfly269</Username><Timestamp>1373655521580</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 14:58:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373656987397-71</Id><Topic><Title>Jury Will Find Zimmerman Not Guilty in Less Than 4 Hours</Title><Username>plmartintexas2012</Username><Timestamp>1373551500962</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-11 10:05:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"jump a stranger and threaten to kill him." No evidence to that, and you weren't there to witness it." Actually there is consistent testimony to that effect. There is no evidence to dispute that story, which is what was required. "Georgey is a proven liar" Not in this case, but Trayvon's dad said it was NOT Trayvon before he said it was. He was no child, the evidence that is not in dispute supports Zimmerman 100%. People do get away with murder with 1000 times more evidence (see O.J.). It too bad when that happens but in America you need some evidence of guilt, which the prosecution failed to provide. I am not as convinced as Martin he won't become a political prisoner, but the evidence does not support a conviction on any level.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373656987397</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-12 15:23:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373657216703-72</Id><Topic><Title>THE MARKET IS STILL A J-O-K-E!

One thing I would not do is hide in the bushes and jump him and threaten to kill him. "It's what you intend to do when you follow that determines the legality." "G had a gun and the result of following was death" So in your idiotic logic everyone who carries a weapon intends to kill someone, idiot? No, dead wrong, I have a gun with me most times as I have for 20 years and I have not so much as let anyone know I have it, You logic is stupid, you hatred of whites is telling your desire to convict with no evidence shows you un-American. And we know with certainty that Zimmerman had no intent to kill Trayvon.
