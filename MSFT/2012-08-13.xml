That was the Bush/Cheney/Republican Congress economic practice. It's what George Herbert Bush called voodoo economics. Romney is under pressure from the Koch Bros and Koch Bros funded radicals to go back to supply side - trickle on economics. That is the reason Romney picked Ryan.</Msg><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1344897008000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 18:30:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344897203000-38</Id><Title>What Would Henry Adams Say About Sheldon Adelson?</Title><Msg>What Would Henry Adams Say About Sheldon Adelson? http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-12/what-would-henry-adams-say-about-sheldon-adelson-.html AFTER SCOTUS RULING MONEY RULES THIS ELECTION!</Msg><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1344897203000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 18:33:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344897693000-39</Id><Topic><Title>What Would Henry Adams Say About Sheldon Adelson?</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1344897203000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 18:33:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He probably would say "that dude has almost as much money as Soros".</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1344897693000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 18:41:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344898124000-40</Id><Topic><Title>Supply Side Is Not Conservative</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1344897008000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 18:30:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Romney, Ryan Regan plan for Recovery.
