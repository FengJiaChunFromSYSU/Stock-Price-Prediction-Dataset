The calls increased as anti-American demonstrations and attacks spread to Yemen, and as protests entered their third day near the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, Egypt. The clashes continued, after four Americans including the U.S. ambassador were killed Tuesday night during attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. The attack came roughly a year after the U.S. and its allies helped Libyans overthrow dictator Muammar Qaddafi. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told Fox News that President Obama should be putting particular pressure on Egypt and its president, Mohammed Morsi, over the sustained demonstrations there. King said the U.S. should suspend aid to Egypt until Morsi makes "absolutely clear" he is condemning the demonstrations and taking "forceful action" to protect the U.S. Embassy. Obama, in an interview with Spanish-language network Telemundo, pushed back on the idea of suspending aid, saying the U.S. "doesn't have an option of withdrawing from the world." On Egypt, he said pointedly: "I don't think that we would consider them an ally, but we do not consider them an enemy." King countered: "If he's not an ally, why do we continue to give him billions of dollars in aid?" Egypt was slated to receive $1.6 billion this year in U.S. aid. Protesters earlier in the week stormed the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and tore down the U.S. flag. Other officials said the U.S. needs to make clear to these countries that they are accountable for what happens at the U.S. embassies. "When you attack an embassy, you're attacking America," Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., told Fox News. John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under the George W. Bush administration, said Obama should communicate privately to Egypt and Libya that if this happens again, "we're cutting off all assistance." "That message has to go all across the Middle East," he said. Some lawmakers were trying to carve out U.S. aid to Libya in the stopgap funding bill hitting Capitol Hill this week. The House approved the $1.047 trillion bill in a 329-91 vote. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, went further, saying Wednesday that the U.S. should send a signal that "this barbaric behavior will not be tolerated" by suspending aid, closing U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya and expelling their diplomats from the U.S.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347619455952</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 06:44:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347621167597-9</Id><Topic><Title>"Make no mistake..."

Governments have been toppled in Egypt and Tunisia. Protests have erupted in Libya, Yemen, and Bahrain. The ruling families elsewhere in the region look on nervously from their air-conditioned penthouses—will they be next? They are right to worry. These are societies where a minuscule fraction of the population—less than 1 percent—controls the lion’s share of the wealth; where wealth is a main determinant of power; where entrenched corruption of one sort or another is a way of life; and where the wealthiest often stand actively in the way of policies that would improve life for people in general. As we gaze out at the popular fervor in the streets, one question to ask ourselves is this: When will it come to America? In important ways, our own country has become like one of these distant, troubled places.</Msg><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1347629911522</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:38:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347630444683-32</Id><Topic><Title>So sad, but so true !!!</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1347629911522</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 09:38:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All the tinder is in place for a massive wild fire in America.

During his tenure as chairman, Bernanke has overseen the Federal Reserve's response to the late-2000s financial crisis. Before becoming Federal Reserve chairman, Bernanke was a tenured professor at Princeton University and chaired the department of economics there from 1996 to September 2002, when he went on public service leave. From 2002 until 2005, he was a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, proposed the Bernanke Doctrine, and first discussed "the Great Moderation"--the theory that traditional business cycles have declined in volatility in recent decades through structural changes that have occurred in the international economy, particularly increases in the economic stability of developing nations, diminishing the influence of macroeconomic (monetary and fiscal) policy.

In an interview with POLITICO, Koch — a Mideast hawk who was recently hospitalized during the Democratic Party platform fight over language relating to Jerusalem as Israel's capital — said he is "still on the [Obama] train." But he expressed displeasure with the president on issues related to Israel, and said Romney was within his rights to have criticized the administration when and in the way he did. "I don't think that Romney said anything bad," he said, adding that the comments he liked the most were from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. "She was really wonderful." "(Romney) was right about the embassy statement," he said. "The issue itself is in-bounds ... (it is fair) for the GOP candidate to disagree" with the response. Koch, a popular figure among American Jews who had been expected to go to Florida to campaign for Obama, insisted the only thing that would keep him from doing it now is his health, and logistical troubles he has getting around now. But he added that while he's still backing Obama, "I am distressed that they did not put back all of the language that was" removed from the 2008 platform about Jerusalem. "I'm very distressed with what is happening," he went on, saying, 'I do not believe it could have been changed (the first time, removing the language) without White House approval." Obama's aides have said he ordered the language to be restored, a day after the flap broke through the noise of the convention in Charlotte and into headlines elsewhere. He also faulted Obama over the report that the White House turned down a requested meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has all but endorsed Mitt Romney (the White House denied that sequence of events). But he added he believes the platform issue will negatively impact Obama in states like Florida: "That's got to inflame people who are supporters of Israel." The assumption among many operatives is the feelings about where Obama is on Israel and the Mideast is essentially hardened in voter sentiment at this point. Still, Koch is publicly criticizing his chosen candidate at this stage of the game, and as the situation in the Mideast is still erupting in violence today.</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1347646191878</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 14:09:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347646531859-76</Id><Topic><Title>Arab Spring birthplace among nations hit by anti-American rage</Title><Username>gregjanetommax</Username><Timestamp>1347646063582</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 14:07:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The reason they blame Romney is because he is a puke/flatearther/bagger/RWNJ and as such he is as likely to repeat Bush's mistake of invading the wrong country as Bush was.

She told ThinkProgress that they had met with Alex Wong, Romney’s political director and legal policy adviser, to discuss the issue of pornography and what he would do about it if elected president. "During that meeting, Wong allegedly told Morality in Media that the campaign “would pursue prosecutions” of pornography and that the issue is “important to them.” The Romney campaign met with the organization “a number of times” in the past three months, Hawkins said. "The isn’t the first time that pornography became an issue in the campaign. Romney signed Morality in Media’s pledge during the Republican primaries, promising “strict enforcement for our nation’s obscenity laws,” calling the matter “imperative.” In addition, the national GOP platform calls for “vigorously” enforcing anti-pornography laws. The effort is a throwback to the Bush administration, when Attorney General John Ashcroft spent “millions to file charges across the country” in an attempt to target “just about everything on the Internet and almost everything in the video stores and everything in the adult bookstores.” "Though the Republican nominee may not discuss the issue on the stump, anti-pornography activists are excited about the prospect of a Romney presidency." ****** Utahns, famous for their wholesomeness and frugality, buy online pornography at higher rates than the rest of America. That's the conclusion of a Harvard economics professor who tracked subscriptions to online porn sites. Utah ranks No. 1 in subscriptions, according to Benjamin Edelman, who reported his findings in the article "Red Light States: Who Buys Online Adult Entertainment?," published in the most recent edition of the Journal of Economic Perspectives. The most porn-watching ZIP codes in Utah, "with unexpectedly high subscriptions relative to their population and broadband usage," are 84766 in Sevier County, 84112 in Salt Lake County, 84018 in Morgan County, 84006 in southwest Salt Lake County, and 84536 in San Juan County. ****** "Sister Wives Gone Wild" just got a bit more expensive.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1347667734394</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 20:08:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347667742657-100</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. Marines on the ground in Libya and Yemen</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1347644608330</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 13:43:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OBL got a fine group hug, among the many other terrorists Obama "hugged."

When Hitler’s hordes stole Germany, they stormed town-halls across the Fatherland carrying their sacred symbols of nationalism reinforced by a form of Christianity that lent moral credence to mob rule. In fact, Nazism could not have risen had it not been for German evangelicals and fundamentalists embedded within the various religious sects and denominations. German Christians were seduced by the allure of national pride, and in doing so, the flag, eagle, and swastika became select idols of that time – images so sacred anyone caught desecrating them were put to death. Twenty-first century America is encumbered by a mass cult which is stripping away the nation’s constitutional rights, civil liberties, and potential greatness. Ironically, it is also threatening the very religious freedom for which they claim to cherish dearly. Symbols mean more than substance today. Little flag pins arouse more adoration than real acts of valor. FOX’s America preferred to investigate (and lie about) John Kerry’s medals than George Bush’s AWOL, cocaine use, and draft-dodging. FOX’s America preferred to perpetrate the Obama birth certificate myth than investigate torture and treason. Barack without a tie in the Oval Office elicited more outrage than Blackwater’s murders. It is symbolism the right-wing is after, not reality. Surface outweighs substance. Not only the flag, but the cross and Bible are erected as idols. And sadly, the national idolatry cult has racial overtones – like the original fascist movement 80 years before. Nazis venerated the flag, the swastika, Mein Kampf, and the eagle. The American right-wing venerates the flag, the cross, the Bible and the eagle. The parallels can’t be more apparent.</Msg><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1347671935143</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 21:18:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347673044777-116</Id><Title>Hussein kills 2 more SEALS, that brings his total to 24 SEALS that he's murdered</Title><Msg>The POS Kenyan killed 22 in the ancient Chinook flying bus and now 2 more in Libya.
