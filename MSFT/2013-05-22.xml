In fact, CCUR's net income last quarter was up 450% from three quarters ago and its operating income was up 559% from three quarters ago. CCUR has reduced operating expenses from being 56.2% of revenues three quarters ago to only 51.8% of revenues last quarter, while simultaneously increasing gross margins from 57.4% to 59.1%. This has allowed CCUR's operating profit margin to rise over the past twelve months from 1.2% all the way up to 7.3%. Last quarter alone, CCUR earned GAAP EPS of $0.11 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.16. CCUR's fundamentals will likely continue improving as they are now beginning to power Virgin Media's Virgin TV Anywhere platform for video on demand (VOD) delivery to the tablets/smartphones of their 3.8mm subscribers. Time Warner Cable just launched their new Android and iOS apps, and CCUR's CDN technology is now powering VOD delivery to the mobile devices of their 12mm subscribers. CCUR's business will continue to boom as pay-TV operators launch multi-screen services to better compete with Netflix (NFLX). NFLX Is up 347% over the past year and their quarterly operating income is only up 97% vs. CCUR's operating income up 559%. NFLX's operating margin has only improved from 1.8% to 3.1%, while CCUR's has improved from 1.2% to 7.3%. CCUR operating margins are now 235% above NFLX and NFLX is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 3.48, which would value CCUR at $27.69 up 299% from its current price of $6.94. NFLX has negative cash flow vs. CCUR's cash flow of $7.13mm. CCUR is trading with an enterprise value of only $38.38mm or 5X cash flow! CCUR pays a huge 3.5% cash dividend yield not including last year's bonus dividend that increased their total cash dividend yield to 10.7%.</Msg><Username>frankf4u489</Username><Timestamp>1369228667775</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:17:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369229161838-30</Id><Topic><Title>Reminds of 1987, 2000, 2007</Title><Username>tonoos</Username><Timestamp>1369223686879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 07:54:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"SO you call Capitalism a cancer...."

Just not in ways that benefit the nation, but hurt us all in the long run. It is a full-time, all-out assault on the opponents of left kookery, abusing them with the full breadth of the federal bureaucracy: Fast and Furious - Strategy to fight conservatives and further restrict the 2nd Amendment. Problem?: Obama-ites don't know what they are doing, and Americans died. IRS - Audit, scrutinize, obfuscate, data mine, delay, deny, penalize all possible conservative people and groups, Christians and Jews. Minimally, it is unethical (which doesn't bother them). It is un-American and an illegal abuse of power in order to limit and suppress information and voting. Control of the Press - shoving the 1st Amendment protections of the press into the toilet, they have seized protected records, compromised e-mail accounts and computers, and intimidated members of the press and their families, most not related to any federal investigatory activity, but against those who are digging into the administration's bizarre activities. Illegal. There are rumblings about CIA sources that say that White House is also sitting on something that has top aides terrified with regard to the aggressive illegal encroachment into the press. The difference between today's Intimigate and Watergate, other than Intimigate is 74 times larger and more severe, is that lying radical liberals have no moral integrity or standards that they hold themselves to. They never get to the point where they feel they must tell the truth under oath. They are leftists first, everything else including being American after that. This position of shame-free sleeezery is why they have been so successful in spreading their disease so exponentially since the late 60's.</Msg><Username>plmartintexas2012</Username><Timestamp>1369233628671</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 10:40:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369234150580-61</Id><Title>Another bashing for MSFT...</Title><Msg>Markets surging again and MSFT getting killed again.

Quoting: "For all the grief the tech industry has given Microsoft about its lack of Windows 8 apps (yours truly included), here's a funny thing: Most Windows 8 users aren't even using so-called "Metro-style" Windows 8 apps. "That means they are mostly using Windows 7 apps via the Windows 7 "desktop" mode, according to new research from Soluto, a startup that helps people remotely manage Windows devices. "Soluto looked at the activities on 10,848 Windows 8 machines and discovered that about 60% of them don't even open one Windows 8 app per day. Those who have a Windows 8 tablet, versus those with Windows 8 on a laptop or PC, use Metro apps more frequently. But some 44% still don't use a Windows 8 app every day.

Climate change is causing Arctic ice to melt at an accelerating rate. Last summer, the area of ice covering the Arctic Ocean was about half what it was, on average, from 1980 to 2000. The thickness of the remaining ice had diminished by 80 percent over the same period. The late-summer Arctic could regularly be ice-free as soon as the 2030s, according to some estimates. Although these developments portend ominous changes in the jet stream, ocean currents and global climate, they also promise great opportunities. With less ice will come more access to oil and gas: **************************************************************** Expect mass extinctions of wild life, polar bear, walrus, artic fox, numerous whale species etc. Thanks Warming Deniers and Koch Bros Sycophants.

Hewlett-Packard CEO Meg Whitman had a lot more to say about the company's new Android products than she did about Windows 8 during HP's second-quarter earnings conference call. Whitman's remarks hinted at HP's newfound affinity for new operating systems, which includes Android of course. "Using multiple operating systems, multiple architectures, and multiple form factors, we are moving quickly to product the devices that customers want," she said. Then she proceeded to talk about new Android devices, with no mention of Windows 8.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1369267407525</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:03:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369267433662-219</Id><Topic><Title>going LONG here, oh BILL GATES</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368549474411</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:37:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i signed up with them.</Msg><Username>bgates354</Username><Timestamp>1369267433662</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:03:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369267436011-220</Id><Topic><Title>going LONG here!! up 3k</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368549513779</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 12:38:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i signed up with them.</Msg><Username>bgates354</Username><Timestamp>1369267436011</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:03:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369267987296-221</Id><Topic><Title>500% in profit just this MONTH</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368250132474</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 01:28:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i signed up with them.</Msg><Username>bgates354</Username><Timestamp>1369267987296</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:13:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369268005927-222</Id><Topic><Title>HP CEO talks Android, not Windoze 8</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1369267407525</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 20:03:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do you make it seem like Windows 8 is the only thing going for MSFT?

The nation’s first family is looking to cool their jets this summer at a house in Farm Neck on Martha’s Vineyard, according to the Boston Globe. Obama and his family are no stranger to Martha’s Vineyard, having made three previous summer visits to Blue Heron Farm in Chilmark. Their favorite Blue Heron Farm house might not be available anymore. It was purchased in late 2011 by British architect Norman Foster for $21.9 million.

The first couple reportedly likes the Farm Neck property because its’ secluded and attached to a golf club. It’s believed Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha would do an extended summer stay at Farm Neck, with President Obama joining them on weekends and perhaps for two weeks in late August, according to the Boston newspaper.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1369274461776</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 22:01:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369276063736-232</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft: Barclays Ups Target to $35 From....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1369249164273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:59:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Target reached, hello, today was obviously the day to exit longs, hello.</Msg><Username>misterreality14</Username><Timestamp>1369276063736</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 22:27:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369278447395-233</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft: Barclays Ups Target to $35 From....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1369249164273</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 14:59:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We had several strong selloffs over the past 2 days-- shorting and profit taking.
