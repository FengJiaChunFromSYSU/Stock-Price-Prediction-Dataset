I would lead Apple by taking the Surface computer to quad-core Atom. If I wanted a wristwatch computer I would instead develop a small mobile phone. Just go for innovative form factor. Previously, I said spin-off the Xbox into a separate company. Next, I would build on Skype by offering a full VOIP telephone service. But favor the budget users that just want to save money. See, a telephone will just plug-in to a cable modem. Also, note that Consumer Cellular was a budget re-seller of mobile phone service. "Was" until AT&amp;T bought them. As for software, think in terms of what MS doesn't have. Trade platform, CAD program, photo editing, and so on. But it's too late to compete in any of those categories.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1366086791834</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 00:33:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366090772596-3</Id><Topic><Title>Zune Watch?

As for their business applications, they are more for the small business market. In fact here is an example of new PC form factors developing: HP has a Spectre laptop that might be similar to the Samsung Series 9.

Now that slavery appears to have been defeated finally with no doubt whatsoever there is no more use for a program of terror against slaves or former slaves and their decendants.

Thank God for regulations to protect our safety from greedy business owners, the ones who sell faulty appliances and don't care. Next time your car is recalled and fixed at no expense to you, remember that. Thanks be to God we elected President Obama. Gun slaughter is not by accident, if you still refuse to understand cookers are not guns. That's because guns are made to kill, cookers are made to cook. Is this really so hard to understand?

Richard Barrett, the former United Nations co-ordinator for the al-Qaeda and Taliban monitoring team, said it was too early to say who was to blame for the marathon blasts. But Barrett, who has served with MI5, MI6 and the British Foreign Office, said the timing of the attack on Patriots' Day and the relatively small size of the devices suggested the work of a domestic extremist. His comments came after US supercop Bill Bratton, a former head of Boston police who is now based in London, warned there are "no shortage of potential suspects" behind the explosions. Barrett, who is now senior director at the Qatar International Academy for Security Studies (QIASS), said: "At the moment it looks more likely that it was a right-wing terrorist incident, rather than an al Qaeda attack because of the size of the devices."</Msg><Username>punch_the_hippie</Username><Timestamp>1366152617779</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 18:50:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366152731616-76</Id><Topic><Title>Liberal Control of Media Destroying America</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1366046909150</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-15 13:28:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Like FAUX Opinions ???"

On ZDNet now.... ------------------------------------------------ It looks like Microsoft is betting all its chips on the silly notion that Metro will be the one true interface for its entire PC and device line. There's only one little problem with this idea. Sorry, but I have to say it again, look at the numbers: Metro-interface operating systems have already failed. Fewer people than with any previous edition of Windows want Windows 8. Vista actually looks successful when you compare it to Windows 8! As for tablets and smartphones, I think my ComputerWorld colleague Preston Gralla summed it up nicely in his analysis of ABI Research's report on 2013's tablet market: "Windows tablets don't even rate a blip in the $64 billion tablet market." So, what do the numbers show? Not what do you want them to show, and not what would your faith in Microsoft would have you believe, but what do they actually add up to? The sum is that Microsoft is failing to hold on to the desktop market and that it has no impact whatsoever on smartphones and tablets. Windows 8 may not just be a failure in and of itself. Unless Microsoft changes course, this may be the end of the Windows domination period in end-using computing. Indeed, some major financial firms, such as Goldman Sachs and Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers (KPCB), already believe that Windows has crested and that it's all downhill from here. -----------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366165649112</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 22:27:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366165660160-92</Id><Title>Why Aren't Those Leftist Analysts at CNN Reporting on the Infant Baby Slaughterhouse?</Title><Msg>Could it be that they are in bed with Baby Killer Gosnell and Planned Parenthood and Obama on the issue of infanticide?.</Msg><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1366165660160</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 22:27:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366166791265-93</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Ducks Paying His Fair Share of Income Tax</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1366164812039</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 22:13:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1.
