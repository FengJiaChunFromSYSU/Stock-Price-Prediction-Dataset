You need only be or work for a Microsoft contractor, or subcontractor, or subsubcontractor..." So essentially any individual who ever, in any circumstance, uses an MS based PC is a "shill"? I guess I'm guilty then, except that nowhere in my employment chain do I roll up to MS in any way. I do have exactly one laptop in my home running Win 7. All other pc's I have run Linux - and I built them myself. I own several IOS and Android devices. So yes I own and use every device, platform, or technology that I discuss. The general user base loves the iphone and ipad because they are good products - I've taken nothing from Apple in that regard. Many consumers will end up choosing less expensive devices when they are available and comparably functional. Many die-hard Apple users will remain, as there has always been a cult following who actually want to purchase the most expensive products to maintain social status. Going forward, Apple will continue to lose market share, and back-end IT shops will be more interested/aggressive in integrating Windows based devices into their MS based networks. These factors combined will drive MS device acceptance and adoption going forward.</Msg><Username>Bill_Meister</Username><Timestamp>1344430415000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 08:53:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344432501000-14</Id><Topic><Title>M$ is pushing users and vendors to Macs and Linux</Title><Username>phands.theapostate58</Username><Timestamp>1344378893000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 18:34:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Funny, you immediately knew that MGX is a conference.

What else would MGX be if not a conference? Actually I have no idea what it is, and don't really care. At any rate this board, and this conversation, is completely pointless and apparently nothing more than a forum for staging personal attacks. Do what you want, believe what you want, I could care less. I'm currently long MSFT and see them growing their market share in the mobile/portable device market. I also see W8 generating additional revenue for the company.

I don't do a system image once a month for backup, I copy the HD to another HD (in realtime) for backup incase the main HD ever goes out I can simply boot to the backup HD and never miss a beat. That being the case, I installed ubuntu on a ssd HD all by itself, the one with w7 is exactly same brand and speed as the HD with ubuntu. I booted with the HD containing ubuntu and did benchmark test then compared them with the w7 HD, and w7 out performed ubuntu by 25%, not that I would use ubuntu even if it were faster because most of the programs I use will only run on WINDOWS.

I'm betting MS will finally break into the mainstream mobile space with WP8. "M$ mobile sales are tragic....there's no way they even recouped the marketing budget" with what?

(See below.)&lt; See below? I want the link. &gt;I have been saying that there were supercomputers in the Top 500 that run an M$ OS and you have been saying there aren't&lt; I said there wer'nt any top500 HPC supercomputers on Nov 17, 2010 and tomshareware confirms it. Infact, the top500 site confirms it. &gt;And that it was impossible since each supercomputer needs it's own OS&lt; Yep. i sure did. "Although most modern supercomputers use the Linux operating system, each manufacturer has made its own specific changes to the Linux-derivative they use, and no industry standard exists, partly due to the fact that the differences in hardware architectures require changes to optimize the operating system to each hardware design?" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_computers &gt;M$ couldn't do that and wasn't interested in doing it.&lt; I did'nt say msft could not do it, i said msft was wasn't interested&gt; "For us, it's not about some exotic supercomputers that are available to a small amount of users," he added. "We're really interested in the bottom 500,000 computing users." http://www.tomshardware.com/news/supercomputer-petaflop-windows-hpc-server-bill-hilf-tsubame-2.0,11643.html &gt;Time after time I have posted a link to the page where they sell their supercomputer OS. But finally you went there and said it didn't say supercomputer anywhere on the page.&lt; That page don't say supercoumuter. &gt;their HPC OS site mentions supercomputers in many different places&lt; Link? &gt;Well except for the fact that the year was 2010 &lt; Typo, I was wrong, I have sinned, my copy and past went past the url, so sad. But a typo is not as bad as getting the gist wrong as you did in you "there is no search" post, still we can call it even on the I was wrong. But the tomshareware site is no open for debate, it says what it says. ""November 17, 2010 "microsoft seemed pleased with the results despite not making the top 500"""" &gt;since 2001 there has always been at least one supercomputer in the top 500 running it.&lt; That statement is shakey and Irrelevant. I said on there were no HPC top500 supercomputers on Nov 17, 2010 and unless you can disprove the tomshareware site, zip your PIEHOLE.</Msg><Username>krarners_ghost</Username><Timestamp>1344445267000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 13:01:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344445449000-40</Id><Topic><Title>Right Wing Redefines Patriot As A Tax Evader</Title><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1344392831000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-07 22:27:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not the least is Tim Geithner, "the Turbo Tax Kid" who is US Secretary of the Treasury and advises on and enforces tax policy.</Msg><Username>goodguy00000000l</Username><Timestamp>1344445449000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 13:04:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344446051000-41</Id><Title>Majority Americans want Pres.

This was not a "legitimate" "tax break" and decidedly NOT something, (you are likely an exception to this), that honest people including myself would resort to. From the article that you were too lazy and arrogantly self assured to read thoroughly: "Like other prepackaged corporate tax shelters of that era, Marriott's Son of Boss transaction was an entirely artificial transaction, bearing no relationship to its business. Its sole purpose was to create a gigantic tax loss out of thin air without any economic risk, cost or loss -- other than the fee Marriott paid the promoter. The Son of Boss transaction was vulnerable to attack on at least two grounds. First, the transaction's promoters and consumers relied on a strained technical statutory analysis. Second, the Son of Boss deal violated the fundamental tax principle that the tax law ignores transactions unless they have a motivating business purpose and a substantial nontax economic effect. In the Marriott case, the IRS raised both arguments and won on the first interpretive issue. The Court of Claims (affirmed by the Court of Appeals) rejected Marriott's technical analysis, finding no reliable argument or authority to support it. The court therefore did not need to reach the issue of business purpose and economic substance. In subsequent decisions, involving similar transactions but other parties, the courts have sustained the second line of attack as well, finding the claimed losses to be fictitious. The complete judicial rejection of the Son of Boss tax scheme was entirely predictable. In mid-1994, for example, roughly contemporaneously with Marriott's execution of its Son of Boss trade and well before Marriott filed its return claiming the artificial loss, the highly respected Tax Section of the New York Bar Association filed a public comment with the U.S. Treasury and IRS urging rejection of the technical claims made by promoters of such schemes."</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1344455927000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 15:58:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344456010000-71</Id><Title>Technical Chart Shows Upside on Microsoft Corporation</Title><Msg>Im in shock!Microsoft Corporation is on the verge of a major change in trend.

The Obama administration was considering waivers that would give states more flexibility in the welfare-to-work program. The Romney campaign left out a couple of things, however. The first, was that requests for such waivers have come from a number of Republican governors.

Misty water color memories: ***“You know how boys liked to go through their dad’s top drawer, just to sort of see what he has in there, maybe find an old coin he might not miss?” Mr. Romney asked the audience. Mr. Romney recalled doing just that: rummaging through his father’s drawer one day when he was in his teens or early 20s .… “I found a little paper card, a little pink card, and it said this entitles George W. Romney to a lifetime of a hamburger, a shake and French fries at McDonald’s,” Mr. Romney said. “It was signed by the hand of Ray Kroc.” …. “I saw this thing and was like, ‘This is a gold mine, Dad!’ ” “So I had it laminated,” Mr. Romney said. “My dad, as you know, would go almost every day to a McDonald’s restaurant and get either a hamburger or a fish filet sandwich. And he would present this little card, and of course, the person behind the counter would look and say, ‘Well, what is that?’ They’d never seen something like that, but he said it was never turned down.**** Also found in the drawer: -George's stash of “sister wife” pr0n, which Mitt also had laminated and keeps to this day. -Three bottles of industrial strength PentaGon brand BrainWash(tm), kept in case of having to prolong the Vietnam war throughout George's first term to guarantee jingoistic support for re-election. -The real twelve years of tax returns, not the ones cooked up for the “disclosure” stunt.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1344470654000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 20:04:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344470671000-110</Id><Title>I WANT TO SEE THOSE REV WRIGHT VIDEOS AGAIN</Title><Msg>ANYBODY GOT A LINK?</Msg><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1344470671000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 20:04:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344471038000-111</Id><Topic><Title>July 2012 Hottest Month Ever!</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1344465582000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 18:39:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No there was nothing "normal" about it.

The Washington Post's The Fact Checker notes that the waivers Romney was writing about [as governor of MA] were different than the ones currently up for discussion. "Moreover, the governors were addressing their concerns through the legislative route, on a bill that at the time had bipartisan support" -- unlike the Obama administration's tendency to just go do whatever it wants by executive order or some other mechanism when it can't win in Congress. Not that this makes Romney's ad any more truthful. And Obama more of a SCUMBAG FASCIST!</Msg><Username>goodgal000000001</Username><Timestamp>1344476953000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:49:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344477241000-155</Id><Topic><Title>BIRTH CONTROL QUEEN FLUKE IS INTRODUCING OBAMA AT CONVENTION.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1344476807000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:46:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just imagine....
