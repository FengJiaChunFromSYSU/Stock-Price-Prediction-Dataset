Woto posts factual and opinion pieces written by industry observers and cognoscenti in the IT field. Any bashing done will be contained in the articles and the vast majority of those are balanced between honest criticism and kudos for MS. "SUX poster boi &amp; shil" Bull. Whatever woto prefers as an OS for his own personal use he does not shill. That appears to be primarily YOUR purpose here along with being a boot licking fan boy yourself for the inept MS. ""when MSFT gets to $40 dollars he will shet himself." Woto would be somewhat surprised to see MS regain that mark after a decade or more but as an independent observer and experienced computer user he will not be at all moved by such an eventuality because it would have no affect on him financially, personally nor professionally. The more you attack the credibility of honest brokers and accurate reporting the brighter the light shines on your own dishonesty, lack of ethics and complete credibility void.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1364575295253</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 12:41:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364576057159-15</Id><Topic><Title>Let's continue the slow climb back to $40</Title><Username>sbutler218</Username><Timestamp>1364478304512</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 09:45:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Take a hike you malicious busybody Q,U,E,E,R Troll !</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1364576057159</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-29 12:54:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364576962324-16</Id><Topic><Title>Let's continue the slow climb back to $40</Title><Username>sbutler218</Username><Timestamp>1364478304512</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-28 09:45:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks for verifying what I said about you.

The real problem is the North Korean hackers that can hack into Samsung (Androids) at will. Stop here and bing "Fbi says Android is unsafe. Not only can they hack into the phone to get a password, snoop emails it is worse MUCH WORSE. Due to the 400 apps you cannot get rid of and allowing access to your camera, microphone and location for the maps it is game on for Mr. Evil Hacker. He can turn your microphone on and listen to every sound day or usually at night so the creeps can hear moaning. They may get intrigued to turn on the camera and use it as a hidden web cam. And the cherry on top, they wait until you are 40 miles away as they watch your phone moving further away on the goog map. Then when you are long gone, the safe robbery occurs.
