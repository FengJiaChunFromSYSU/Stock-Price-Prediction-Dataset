Every network made excuses for the president. I dont think I have ever witnessed anything so revolting. Win or lose Romney showed the American people how a well informed astute leader handles himself with confidence and conviction, without a teleprompter. To make matters worse, University of Wisconsin students were asked if the president should have been allowed to use a teleprompter during the debate. Most said yes.

He mentions that his plan will support health care coverage for those with pre existing conditions but does not mention that they must be under health insurance first. If you are one of the 46+ million without health care coverage and get sick, forget about getting health care coverage with the Romney plan.

Much of Stiglitz’s book is devoted to demonstrating that excessive inequality amounts to sand in the gears of capitalism, creating volatility, fueling crises, undermining productivity and retarding growth. Just as discrimination results in the failure of a nation to make the best use of all its citizens, inequality, when it leads to inadequate schooling, housing and neighborhood conditions for large numbers of people, acts in a similarly destructive fashion.</Msg><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1349533161471</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 10:19:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349536246762-21</Id><Topic><Title>Romney exposed obama for what he is.

Whether your found quote of him saying he has a lazy side makes you think that or not is up to you. I have said many times I am being lazy. No interviewer recording it though. Sununu knows it is a racially charged statement, and used it as such. You know it too. It only gets support from your base, which is the irony. Obama has done so so much good for this country and he gets to be called lazy, muslim, not American, on and on. That isn't a discussion of policy, that's blatant old George Wallace style racism.

You can compare political parties- you can only compare conservative vs liberal. The conservatives have always been on the wrong side of history and against freeing the slaves, against womans suffrage, for child labor, against national pension (social security), against medical care for the sick, old and poor. Even now they want to take medical care away from these people by installing programs from Ryuns loony financial plan.

The politically incorrect list refers to Romney as a “white n****” who looks like he “says n****” all the time.” Snoop Dogg, who recently changed his name to Snoop Lion, revealed the list, which is not his own, via Instagram. He took a photo of a notebook with the handwritten lists in two columns: “Why I’m Not Voting For Romney” and “Why I Am Voting For Obama.” [See list here] The number one reason cited for not voting for Romney is because “He a white n****.” Likewise, Obama will receive his vote because “He a black n****.” Romney’s debate performance, that most polls say he won, is also a subject of discussion. “He always interrupts and talks over people like he’s netter than them,” he wrote (No. 7). “B**** I will beat the s*** out of you.” [Check out the video below for hip-hop's political involvement.] The list also calls Romney a “ho” (reason No. 4) and makes three different references to his name: “This mutherf***’s name is Mitt” (2,6,10) As for the reasons he’s to voting for Obama, the list highlighted his relationship with Jay-Z (“he’s BFFs with Jay-Z”) and Beyonce (He’s hugged Beyonce before and sniffed her neck”). While the comedic, if crude, list showcases Snoop’s attempt at making a political statement, other rappers have become active in the political process this election. Lupe Fiasco got into a Twitter beef with comedian D.L. Hughley over his anti-voting stance. Nicki Minaj caused a stir when she rapped that she was voting for Romney (though she later clarified that she was actually supporting Obama). Jay-Z held a fundraiser that raised a reported $4 million for the president and Nas has recently recorded a PSA in which he urges the youth to vote.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349554174496</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 16:09:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349554198721-40</Id><Topic><Title>Are Ryan and Sunnunu going to apologize to us now?</Title><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1349536654090</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 11:17:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Revolt of the Spooks Intelligence officials angered by Obama administration cover up of intelligence on Iranian, al Qaeda surge in Egypt and Libya The White House / AP Images The White House / AP Images BY: Bill Gertz October 5, 2012 5:00 am Weeks before the presidential election, President Barack Obama’s administration faces mounting opposition from within the ranks of U.S. intelligence agencies over what career officers say is a “cover up” of intelligence information about terrorism in North Africa. Intelligence held back from senior officials and the public includes numerous classified reports revealing clear Iranian support for jihadists throughout the tumultuous North Africa and Middle East region, as well as notably widespread al Qaeda penetration into Egypt and Libya in the months before the deadly Sept. 11 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. “The Iranian strategy is two-fold: upping the ante for the Obama administration’s economic sanctions against Iran and perceived cyber operations against Iran’s nuclear weapons program by conducting terror attacks on soft U.S. targets and cyber attacks against U.S. financial interests,” said one official, speaking confidentially. The Iranian effort also seeks to take the international community’s spotlight off Iran’s support for its Syrian ally. Two House Republicans, Reps. Darrell Issa (R., Calif.) and Jason Chaffetz (R., Utah), stated in a letter sent this week to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton that officials “with direct knowledge of events in Libya” revealed that the Benghazi attack was part of a string of terror attacks and not a spontaneous uprising against an anti-Muslim video produced in the U.S. The lawmakers have scheduled congressional hearings for Oct. 10. Susan Phalen, spokeswoman for the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers (R., Mich.), said the panel is “reviewing all relevant intelligence and the actions of the [intelligence community], as would be expected of the oversight committee.” But she noted: “At this point in time it does not appear that there was an intelligence failure.”</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349554198721</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 16:09:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349554404460-41</Id><Topic><Title>Are Ryan and Sunnunu going to apologize to us now?</Title><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1349536654090</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 11:17:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Big Super PAC Donor on Obama: 'Looks Like He Took My Million and Spent it All on Weed' 9:33 AM, Oct 6, 2012 • By DANIEL HALPER Single Page Print Larger Text Smaller Text Alerts Bill Maher, a major donor to Barack Obama's super PAC, blasted the president's debate performance on his HBO show last night: "I'm sorry, he sucked," said Maher last night.
