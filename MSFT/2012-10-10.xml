AMD Radeon RAMDisk loading times are expected to be 525% higher than those offered by conventional products</Title><Msg>Dataram Corporation (NASDAQ: DRAM) has announced a huge deal with AMD on September 8. 2012 that is sure to take it to the next level in terms of revenues and net income. The stock is completely under the radar and a reason why its 0.2 X sales valuation giving it a $6.5 million market cap. The company is already almost break-even even before the upcoming AMD-related windfall. DRAM has a strong balance sheet with ZERO long term debt. Per the agreement, DRAM will develop a special edition RAMDisk utility, which will be called AMD Radeon RAMDisk. AMD Radeon RAMDisk loading times are expected to be 525% higher than those offered by conventional products, increasing performance, eliminating bottlenecks and improving the gaming experience on the PC as well as other applications requiring fast processing like complex engineering simulation models. AMD Radeon RAMDisk utility will be available from October to December this year. DRAM develops, manufactures, and markets large capacity memory products primarily used in high performance network servers and workstations worldwide. The company has more than 70 Fortune 100 customers and it’s been in business since 1967. On September 8, 2012 TechNews Science and Technology published the following article about Advanced Micro Devices (NYSE: AMD) plans to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage all editions of its AMD Memory modules for desktops, and to achieve this has made an agreement with Dataram (NASDAQ: DRAM) known developer of memory modules for servers, workstations and desktops, plus other solutions and associated services; agreement that will develop a special edition RAMDisk utility, which will be called AMD Radeon RAMDisk and come free with AMD Memory memory modules. AMD Radeon RAMDisk loading times offer up to 525% higher in games and applications (better than that offered by SSDs), increasing performance, eliminating bottlenecks and improving the gaming experience on the PC. AMD Radeon RAMDisk utility will be available from October to December this year, and although AMD or Dataram gave more details on its operation, we assume that this utility to create a RAM disk to use by way of a fast disk cache, based on the Game and application profiles present in the Catalyst Control Center utility, which comes bundled with graphics cards, motherboards (chipset) and AMD APUs. On September 14, 2012, DRAM stated the following in its fiscal 1Q 2013 earnings report: During this quarter the Company entered into two agreements which we expect will generate growth and profits for Dataram in 2013 and beyond: - An agreement with AMD provides for Dataram to develop and sell AMD licensed and branded versions of its RAMDisk software. AMD’s Radeon RAMDisk will target the gaming enthusiast community. - An agreement with Shoreline Memory Inc. ("Shoreline") and the other with Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. ("AMD") for the purpose of expanding our customer base and product offerings. The Shoreline Agreement provides for Dataram to fulfill 50% of the orders Shoreline receives from its primary customers. Management believes these agreements will provide new revenue sources and expanded markets for the Company's products. Mr. Freeman concluded, “These recent agreements and other new opportunities we are currently pursuing should provide new sources of revenue, profit and growth for Dataram in 2013 and beyond. The experience, knowledge and assets we have gained from our current RAMDisk product, in the development of caching software and in solid state products are building a strong foundation for growth.” DRAM is also an unrecognized cloud play. DRAM makes the XcelaSAN memory/storage family of products for cloud and all other applications. The company recently received $5 million from a Japanese company to allow the non-exclusive right to manufacture products using the XcelaSAN technology.

Wynn, an outspoken critic of President Obama, didn't hold back in his latest criticism of the incumbent president seeking a second term. "I'll be damned if I want to have him lecture me about small business and jobs. I'm a job creator. Guys like me are job creators and we don't like having a bulls-eye painted on our back," Wynn said about Obama to Ralston. An excerpt of the interview is below. WYNN: I've created about 250,000 direct and indirect jobs according to the state of Nevada's measurement. If the number is 250,000, that's exactly 250,000 more than this president, who I'll be damned if I want to have him lecture me about small business and jobs. I'm a job creator. Guys like me are job creators and we don't like having a bulls-eye painted on our back. The president is trying to put himself between me and my employees. By class warfare, by deprecating and calling a group that makes money 'billionaires and millionaires who don't pay their share.' I gave 120% of my salary and bonus away last year to charities, as I do most years. I can't stand the idea of being demagogued, that is put down by a president who has never created any jobs and who doesn't even understand how the economy works. Wynn on a scrapped business plan: "I'm afraid of the president. I have no idea what goofy idea, what crazy, anti-business program this administration will come up. I have no idea. And I have to tell you Jon that every business guy I know in the country is frightened of Barack Obama and the way he thinks."</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349853088112</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 03:11:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349858605568-17</Id><Topic><Title>Big Bird did not like Obamanure's praise of Senator Byrd, a Democrat KKK leader!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349837542530</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:52:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How true.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1349858605568</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 04:43:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349858831152-18</Id><Topic><Title>Poll: are you more stupid, as stupid, or less stupid than Obamanure?</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349850017205</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 02:20:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Like sheep lead them to slaughter.

Quoting from the article: So, what changed? Why did Microsoft go from viewing Linux — or at least the licence that governs it — as a cancer to embracing open-source software, at least to some extent? “I noticed Microsoft was changing and was more open than I thought,” Rabellino says. “Microsoft has become more open and the reason for that is it’s really about it going back to the real Microsoft DNA, to being a platform and ecosystem company.” Pressure from business customers may have played a big role. “Customers are telling us how IT today is all about pragmatism,” Rabellino says. “It’s all about time to market and using the best tools to get the [best results]. People are calling for open standards and interoperability. The minute we take for granted that it’s a mixed [technology] world, interoperability becomes crucial.” But growing maturity — among open-source advocates and proprietary software vendors like Microsoft — has also played a role. The almost religious wars between the two sides have largely died out, Rabellino says. “It’s no longer about religion and ideology. Rather, it’s now about pragmatism, efficient, time to market and working together.”</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1349873217335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 08:46:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349874261514-23</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft learns to love the ‘cancer’</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1349873217335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 08:46:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pragmatism requires the junking of obsolete 'sux and open source software to make way for something that really works like Windows and Microsoft products.

The Lumia 900 when it was released was in the top ten in the Amazon Best Sellers list for many weeks. The black version of the phone was particularly popular as it was in the top ten till the end of June and was one of the highest-rated handsets. Microsoft's collaboration with Nokia is likely to reap rewards for both companies, providing Microsoft with its next big revenue stream. It will provide the basis for the launch of a new generation of Windows phones. Microsoft might well become one of Apple's main competitors in the smartphone market.

Comments (556) By JACK WELCH Imagine a country where challenging the ruling authorities—questioning, say, a piece of data released by central headquarters—would result in mobs of administration sympathizers claiming you should feel "embarrassed" and labeling you a fool, or worse. Related Video Editorial board member Steve Moore on the good and bad of the jobs report and whether it will help President Obama's campaign. Soviet Russia perhaps? Communist China? Nope, that would be the United States right now, when a person (like me, for instance) suggests that a certain government datum (like the September unemployment rate of 7.8%) doesn't make sense. Unfortunately for those who would like me to pipe down, the 7.8% unemployment figure released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) last week is downright implausible. And that's why I made a stink about it. Before I explain why the number is questionable, though, a few words about where I'm coming from. Contrary to some of the sound-and-fury last week, I do not work for the Mitt Romney campaign. I am definitely not a surrogate. My wife, Suzy, is not associated with the campaign, either. She worked at Bain Consulting (not Bain Capital) right after business school, in 1988 and 1989, and had no contact with Mr. Romney. The Obama campaign and its supporters, including bigwigs like David Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, along with several cable TV anchors, would like you to believe that BLS data are handled like the gold in Fort Knox, with gun-carrying guards watching their every move, and highly trained, white-gloved super-agents counting and recounting hourly. Let's get real. The unemployment data reported each month are gathered over a one-week period by census workers, by phone in 70% of the cases, and the rest through home visits. In sum, they try to contact 60,000 households, asking a list of questions and recording the responses. Related Content "Happy Days Are Not Here Again" A Review &amp; Outlook on the September jobs report. Some questions allow for unambiguous answers, but others less so. For instance, the range for part-time work falls between one hour and 34 hours a week. So, if an out-of-work accountant tells a census worker, "I got one baby-sitting job this week just to cover my kid's bus fare, but I haven't been able to find anything else," that could be recorded as being employed part-time. The possibility of subjectivity creeping into the process is so pervasive that the BLS's own "Handbook of Methods" has a full page explaining the limitations of its data, including how non-sampling errors get made, from "misinterpretation of the questions" to "errors made in the estimations of missing data." Bottom line: To suggest that the input to the BLS data-collection system is precise and bias-free is—well, let's just say, overstated.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349878787320</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 10:19:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349879020574-34</Id><Topic><Title>Big Bird did not like Obamanure's praise of Senator Byrd, a Democrat KKK leader!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349837542530</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-09 22:52:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One question that I would like to pose is why did Ben Bernanke opt for QE3 stimulus if the employment picture has improved 0.5% in 2 months time? Ben even mentioned that the Fed has changed its concern from monitoring inflation and GDP growth to one which also incorporated the unemployment figures and would target bringing down the unemployment rate to more historically acceptable levels. DId he get it wrong or is it still a legitimate concern that the state of the economy remains poor and requires the Fed propping up the economy to buy time until it can mend itself? If the labor market is truly improving, then QE3 seems unnecessary and should be put on hold to prevent over-heating the economy, which would result in much higher inflation. Indeed, if the employment picture is that much better than two months ago, we should see a rapid rise in housing prices in the depressed U.S. markets and coupled with higher energy and food prices, we should see validation in much higher inflation figures.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1349879020574</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 10:23:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349881293623-35</Id><Topic><Title>Ambassador Stevens, former SEALS died to support an Obama re-election illusion</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1349862897112</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-10 05:54:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think it goes further than dereliction of duty.

Unfortunately Mitt now doesn’t recall either of them. I recall a time when Mitt called to end man made global warming.
