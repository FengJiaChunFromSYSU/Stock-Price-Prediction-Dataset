Envy is a terrible feeling. You must feel really bad. Why don't you try to make more money to improve your family standard of living. Yes, people work hard, make money, get rich, pay a lot of taxes, support charities, take care of their children, pay their education. Can you do it too? I believe if you apply yourself you can do it. But stop counting on government support.</Msg><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1352782896078</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 00:01:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352783411477-2</Id><Title>Prediction for Tomorrow's Open</Title><Msg>Up or down ?</Msg><Username>balmer_tim</Username><Timestamp>1352783411477</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 00:10:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352783829451-3</Id><Title>I thought this was a Microsoft board but I must be wrong</Title><Msg>I thought this was a Microsoft board but I must be wrong as it seems people are talking about politics rather than Microsoft. I also thought that with the departure of Sinofsky, there would be lots of discussion topics around what is going on after the intro of Surface and windows 8 for one of the top executive behind such products to leave so soon after their intro but doesn't seem to bother any one on this Board just talking about Republicans versus Democrats !!! Is the future of Microsoft of any concern for people on this board ? People have been saying that Ballmer is finally betting his job on those products, so does it mean that Ballmer will finally be asked by a very weak Board of Directors to leave the company after having destroyed so much value during his tenure. He also lost a lot of talents with all those Executives leaving one after the other mainly because they were tired of working for him even if in his mind I am sure that he thinks that he is the one who wanted them to leave ! Again I always thought that Microsoft was a great company with lost of talents and resources under one single company, Bill Gates is a great visionary and strategist as he predicted the iPad, the iPhone, the power of a good search engine, the cloud, etc but sadly enough Microsoft was weak on the operational/implementation side and other companies like Apple and Google made this vision happen. Who is to be blamed but the man in charge of such operations for over 10 years, the CEO. Ballmer has never been a great visionary or strategist, with Bill not around anymore and with the people Bill had managed to attrack and put in place when he left to fill the gap,not being there anymore, who is now driving the vision and strategy at Microsoft ? These are the questions I would like to see people on this board debate not the post mortem of a Presidential election.</Msg><Username>alan74z</Username><Timestamp>1352783829451</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 00:17:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352785048249-4</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA'S VOTERS DON'T LIKE AMERICA.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1352776623342</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 22:17:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>4-5% on the amount over 250,000 net isn't much to ask or pay.

Made my day. Marshawn HogansI find this funny that once you cut into entitlements it is always doom and gloom. When Americans REALLY suffer i.e Sandy, they are considered resilient and can bounce back. Average Americans went through some kind of loss through the recession and have bounced back in some kind of way. Are you saying $50.00 dollars will kill people? I believe it will change their spending habits yes. Sometimes that is needed. The problem is this. There is no proof that entitlement spending corrects poverty. It only increases it. It causes dependency among low income families. It is worse under Obama's Administration by removing the "will to work" policies that Clinton instilled in the welfare program during his administration. The very fact that Democrats would be willing to increase taxes during an unsettled economy is beyond my bel...ief and studies of economics. The fact is this. If we increase taxes, this will not help the situation. Democrats always find new ways to spend it instead of hitting the root cause for it. You can blame Republicans for being greedy all you want but the real problem is spending. I say give the Democrats what they want to prove a point. True conservatives will know what to do with their money once this happens. We can make money from the move. Once the troops that they rallied begin to fall a part and see that choosing a Prom King was not such a good idea, then they will be willing to listen to conservative solutions. I love my country and would not want to see people fall. But sometimes you have to offer tough love like we do our children and let them experience failure at its best.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1352797858559</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 04:10:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352803954612-9</Id><Topic><Title>Which stocks Billionaires Love?</Title><Username>rightdon53</Username><Timestamp>1348905639453</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 04:00:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"This is shocking news.

It comes hard on the heels of Sinofsky unveiling the most radical revamp of Windows since 1995, designed to catapult Microsoft back into the forefront of Internet-based, touch-screen technology and reinvigorate a stock price that has been static for the past decade. The move was unexpected and neither Microsoft nor Sinofsky gave an explanation, although an executive at the company, who asked not to be named, said the decision was "mutual" and said he was not expecting Sinofsky to take a job at another company soon.</Msg><Username>know_it_all_and_more</Username><Timestamp>1352805211964</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 06:13:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352810418596-11</Id><Topic><Title>Steven Sinofsky Resigns!</Title><Username>know_it_all_and_more</Username><Timestamp>1352805211964</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 06:13:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The timing of his move is unrelated to the quality of the products or their reception in the market"</Msg><Username>d186282mps</Username><Timestamp>1352810418596</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 07:40:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352812416314-12</Id><Topic><Title>Latest twist for Petraeus is that he could "face charges" ... maybe he decided to spill the goods.</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1352765592088</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 19:13:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He busted your arz on that one.

They fail to mention, time and again, because it hurts what they say. The tax is only on the amount above 250k agi, not gross income, and it applies to the rich as well. After all your deductions, expenses,and payroll. They leave out the details. Anyone not supporting the tax cut expiration for the people making over 250k net has to be a little nuts. Who in this audience of 5 makes over 250k adjusted gross income? You'd have to be a little nuts not to see Grover and the money behind him, are behind the objections.

Profit on the trade of $408 per 100 shares (2 mentions) minus commissions. The stock gapped down today based on the resignation of Sinofsky who is/was the overseer of the Windows 8 that was just released. Windows 8 has met with mixed reviews and it is not likely it will be a big money winner for the company. The stock could, and probably will, head lower. Nonetheless, there are chart reasons to take profits here as the 200-week MA is at 26.55, the stock has a strong breakaway gap between 26.12 and 26.39 and does have a mountain of congestion support between 24.25 and 27.50, meaning that squeezing more profit out of this trade is going to be like pulling teeth. There are other stocks where faster and more secure profits can be generated. I will consider shorting the stock again around the 27.50 level but not for another few days and even then the risk/reward ratio is not going to be great.</Msg><Username>luckyone581</Username><Timestamp>1352818438239</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 09:53:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352818550063-46</Id><Topic><Title>MICROSOFT WIN8 IS DISASTER : GAME OVER FOR MICROSOFT IN AND PHONES AND TTABLETS</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1352383236355</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 09:00:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what did roar?

Windows8 is a solid product. Yes, it is chasing competitors, but I predict will do well. It is a superior product to what is being offered on other tablets as Droid and iPad are phone operating systems, while Windows8 AND Windows phone are proper OS's. You really have to experience the Windows phone before you believe it is dead. It will grow, slowly, but it will be a competitor. Competition is good, so I am not sure why you would think that it is a good thing for Windows to do badly. Lastly, remember why Apple is even alive.

Some companies that are on the leading (and possibly bleeding edge) will go to W8 so that the interface on all their devices (phones, tablets, PCs, etc) is the same. It's a solid move by MSFT but let's face it, this company isn't in an explosive growth phase and hasn't been for many a year.

One thing you'll learn out there is that being fired from MS is almost a badge of honor in the tech world. Most prospective employers know that success and failure at MS is all about politics and, basically, the good people who just do their job don't succeed, while the incompetents who can kiss #$%$ and promote themselves go to the head of the line. You won't have any problem finding a better job with a better company. In fact, many employers will take you over someone who is thought to be a "star" at MS.

Now that is a truly interesting question, one that begs a multitude of possible scenarios. At some time in the future Ballmer will either retire voluntarily or be forcibly put out to pasture by the board. Could he be secretly cultivating someone inside already for his eventual stepping down? Who from the outside is available and prepared to step in and take the helm of a drifting ship with a worn and threadbare brand to put it right in the water again? What might either of those people bring to the table, what new ideas, what fresh approaches to a mature PC environment? Phone market? Tablet market? Which would be better, an insider with a large amount of accumulated institutional knowledge and intimate familiarity with internal processes, communication channels and personnel capabilities or an outsider with untainted vision? I'd be interested in reading some thoughtful discussion on these questions.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1352835144523</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 14:32:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352835754056-145</Id><Title>Start of buying cycle</Title><Msg>Now is the time to load up on MSFT.With Sinofsky's departure as the catalysis for the weak hearts to sell off,the only direction is up.Lost in this hysteria is the fact that on the first day of sales HALO 4 had $220 million in sales.As far as Sinofsky, Windows Eight is now in the past.New blood was needed to bring Microsoft out from Apple's shadow,and I view his departure as a positive.</Msg><Username>msplanch</Username><Timestamp>1352835754056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 14:42:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352835756516-146</Id><Topic><Title>ibrant57 #$%$ without peer thinks its cool to bash Microsoft</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1352830941319</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 13:22:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BUY BUY BUY M$FT!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1352835756516</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 14:42:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352835857722-147</Id><Title>Windows 8 vs Linux</Title><Msg>Windows 8 boots in 40 seconds on my laptop.

It has an AMD dual core processor, 8gb of RAM, a Samsung SSD and NO WinTel Inside!</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1352835857722</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 14:44:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352836354795-148</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's Windows head, once a possible CEO, exits</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1352832884098</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 13:54:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Verrrrry interesting comments.

However, with respect to the comparison of W8 vs Linux, you are correct on most points. Unlike the Microsoft approach which attempts to force everyone into a tile-driven environment that looks like it was created as an elementary school project, Linux gives users complete flexibility and choice to chose what interface they like, and Linux doesn't push paid advertisements to its apps like Microsoft does without the user's knowledge. W8 is all about what's good for Microsoft.
