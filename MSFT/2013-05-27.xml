You can force w8 to shutdown by pressing Ctrl, Alt, Del, then click on shutdown icon in lower right hand corner of screen. If you want a 1 click SHUTDOWN Icon on the desktop then create a W8 Shutdown Shortcut by right clicking on desktop and choose "new" and choose create new shortcut then type in "Shutdown.exe -s -t 00" without the parentheses and name it SHUTDOWN.

When he first arrived in Stockholm as refugee from Iran in 1994, the vast Husby council estate where he settled was a mixture of locals and foreigners, a melting pot for what was supposed to be a harmonious, multi-racial paradise. ... This weekend, after six consecutive nights of rioting, Mr Mohammed was not the only one questioning the Swedish social model's preference for the carrot over the stick. Many Swedes were left asking why a country that prides itself on a generous welfare state, liberal social attitudes and a welcoming attitude towards immigrants should ever have race riots in the first place.

The proposal, which passed the Senate in an amendment to a budget bill last week and faces an uncertain future in the House, has pitted Brewer against Republican legislative leaders and given new relevance to the state’s beleaguered Democrats. It’s made for an unlikely alliance with advocates who vilified the governor in recent years for deep cuts that froze health coverage for children and temporarily cut off some lifesaving organ transplants for Medicaid patients. “I think the governor has a little bit of a moral streak in her,” said Tim Schmaltz, coordinator of the Protecting Arizona’s Family Coalition, in the Senate lobby last week as lawmakers debated the proposal on the floor.

However, in government more advanced strategies are often employed, Such as: 1. Buying a stronger whip. 2. Changing riders. 3. Appointing a committee to study the horse. 4. Arranging to visit other countries to see how other cultures ride dead horses. 5. Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included. 6. Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired. 7. Hiring contractors to ride the dead horse. 8. Paying consultants to tell you the horse is dead. 9. Harnessing several dead horses together to increase speed. 10. Providing additional funding and/or training to increase the dead Horse's' performance. 11. Doing a productivity study to see if lighter riders would improve the Dead horse's performance. 12. Declaring that as the dead horse does not have to be fed, it is less Costly, carries lower overhead and therefore contributes substantially More to the bottom line of the economy than do some other horses. 13. Rewriting the expected performance requirements for all horses. And, of course... 14.
