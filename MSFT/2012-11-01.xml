Brachear | Chicago Tribune CHICAGO — Joining the chorus of Roman Catholic clergy in Illinois criticizing President Barack Obama before next week's election, Peoria Bishop Daniel Jenky ordered priests to read a letter to parishioners on Sunday before the presidential election, explaining that politicians who support abortion rights also reject Jesus. "By virtue of your vow of obedience to me as your Bishop, I require that this letter be personally read by each celebrating priest at each Weekend Mass," Jenky wrote in a letter circulated to clergy in the Catholic Diocese of Peoria. In the letter, Jenky cautions parishioners that Obama and a majority of U.S. senators will not reconsider the mandate that would require employers, including religious groups, to provide free birth control coverage in their health care plans. "This assault upon our religious freedom is simply without precedent in the American political and legal system," Jenky wrote. "Today, Catholic politicians, bureaucrats, and their electoral supporters who callously enable the destruction of innocent human life in the womb also thereby reject Jesus as their Lord," Jenky added. "They are objectively guilty of grave sin." Earlier this year, Jenky delivered a controversial homily criticizing the contraception mandate. The bishop included Obama's policies in a list of historic challenges the Catholic Church has overcome in previous centuries, including Hitler and Stalin's campaigns. Jenky is the third Illinois Catholic leader to offer pointed guidance for Catholic voters in recent weeks. Last month, Springfield Bishop Thomas Paprocki offered a commentary on the Democratic and Republican parties' platforms that he said wasn't intended as instruction, but guidance. "There are many positive and beneficial planks in the Democratic Party Platform, but I am pointing out those that explicitly endorse intrinsic evils," Paprocki explained in the Springfield Diocese newspaper. "Again, I am not telling you which party or which candidates to vote for or against," he said. "But I am saying that you need to think and pray very carefully about your vote, because a vote for a candidate who promotes actions or behaviors that are intrinsically evil and gravely sinful makes you morally complicit and places the eternal salvation of your own soul in serious jeopardy." Furthermore, in the Rockford Diocese, Vicar General Eric Barr compared Obama's support of religious freedom in Muslim countries to his lack of support for Catholic liberty. "Meanwhile, Obamacare marches on, steamrolling Catholic morality and the First Amendment under its weight. How can that be tolerated by citizens?" Barr wrote. "Nothing justifies this peculiar and unreal stance of the president," he said. Spokeswoman Colleen Dolan said she doesn't expect Chicago's Cardinal Francis George to issue any statements before the election.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351791789197</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 13:43:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351792221050-69</Id><Topic><Title>STUPIDITY IF MSFT: NOBODY LIKES THE BIG LIVE WINDOWS, PINK PROJECT, LIMINA, ETC..</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1351785484582</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 11:58:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're much too stupid to use w8, better you stick with pen &amp; pad.</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1351792221050</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 13:50:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351792343585-70</Id><Topic><Title>Mormon vs. Musllim</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351780608581</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:36:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least the Mormons don't strap a boom device to their pie hole and go bang.</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1351792343585</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 13:52:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351792504430-71</Id><Topic><Title>Conservative Talking Heads Faile To Mention This About Benghazi....</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1351792392519</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 13:53:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>KILL THEM, KILL THEM ALL..!!</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1351792504430</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 13:55:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351792531576-72</Id><Title>MSFT up on very heavy volume for 2 days straight</Title><Msg>The market is finally correcting the under valuations of msft.

After several early voters in North Carolina said last week they cast ballots for Mitt Romney but the electronic ballot machine logged their pick as President Obama, similar problems have popped up this week in Ohio. Voters said they selected Romney on the touch screen but an Obama vote was logged instead. "You want to vote for who you want to vote for, and when you can#$%$ irritating," Ohio voter Joan Steven told the Marion Star. As with the North Carolina cases, election officials had the machine inspected and re-calibrated. Ohio is widely said to the be the most sought-after state in the two campaign's electoral pathway to the White House because of its 18 electoral votes and nearly even split between Obama and Romney, though Obama has held onto a slight lead in recent polls.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351793510215</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 14:11:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351793519154-79</Id><Topic><Title>Romney says..</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1351780234565</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 10:30:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More accurately, Romney says: "I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully exploit the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Wealth of 1% of the United States."</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1351793519154</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 14:11:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351793543091-80</Id><Topic><Title>Conservative Talking Heads Faile To Mention This About Benghazi....</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1351792392519</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 13:53:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Planned Job Cuts Jump 41%, 5-Month High, Report Says By Reuters Posted Nov 1st 2012 @ 9:13AM Filed under: Unemployment Trends and Stats, Employment News &amp; Trends planned layoffs 5-month high The number of planned layoffs by firms jumped 41.1 percent in October to the highest level in five months, although the number includes more than 10,000 jobs in U.S.-owned auto plants in Europe, a report said on Thursday. Employers announced 47,724 planned job cuts last month, up from September's 33,816, according to the report from consultants Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc. It was the highest level since May. U.S. automotive companies said that they will let go of 11,615 workers, though that includes 10,900 Ford layoffs that will affect workers in Belgium and the United Kingdom. The planned layoffs were modestly higher than the 42,759 announced in October last year.

It’s about the struggle between America’s economic past and its future. Mitt Romney and the Republican Party have doubled down on a fading finance- and commodity-dominated economic order. It is one where innovation in research and development finds no domestic markets because incumbent interests hold on to outmoded capital stocks instead of modernizing them, and where innovative manufacturing is sacrificed to other sectors of the economy. As Romney said, inaccurately, in the first debate, lashing out at President Barack Obama: “You provided $90 billion in breaks to the green-energy world. Now, I like green energy as well, but that’s about 50 years’ worth of what oil and gas receives.” The Republicans’ strong tilt toward coal and oil isn’t new. Former President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney were both oil executives, and Senator John McCain embraced “drill, baby, drill” as a mantra in his presidential campaign against Obama in 2008. ************************************************************************************ " incumbent interests hold on to outmoded capital stocks " ......in the above article, "incumbent interests" are the K0ch Bros. "Capital stocks" are the last century's energy technology. In plain english, the K0ch Bros have bought off Romney/Repub Party to protect their business model, the people's needs and planet be damned.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1351815865251</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 20:24:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351815911835-127</Id><Title>Co Founder of Amgen ticker AMGM 86.70 a share buys one million shares of AMBS</Title><Msg>AMBS has news coming out daily this little BIO stock is still undiscovered by most!

By KIMBERLEY A. STRASSEL One of the mores striking aspects of this presidential campaign is how little President Obama is saying on the stump about his plans for a second-term agenda. So keen is the president to keep his ideas from leaking to the public, that his administration is now trying to hide its regulatory agenda. Oklahoma Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe has spent the past week noting that the Obama administration as of today will be missing a statutory deadline on regulatory transparency. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires federal agencies to publish in the Federal Register descriptions of economically significant regulations they expect to propose. These agendas are required to be published on a semi-annual basis, in both April and October. The Obama administration has now failed to meet this legal requirement since the fall of 2011. That is no doubt because to comply with this law, the Obama administration would have to confess to its plans to continue with more than a dozen wildly unpopular and hugely expensive environmental regulations. As the election has heated up over the past year, the Environmental Protection Agency has quietly "delayed" or put aside many of these rules, to keep the president from catching heat. As Sen. Inhofe detailed in a recent report, titled "A Look Ahead to EPA Regulations for 2013," they include the agency's greenhouse gas regulations, its crushing ozone rule, a drastic rewrite of the Clean Water Act, and punitive new restrictions on everything from storm water systems, to sulfur in gasoline, to coal ash, to emissions from industrial boilers. Were the administration to have published in April or October of this year its intention to push through with these regulations, it would severely undercut Mr. Obama's newfound claim that he is in favor of more fossil-fuel development. It would also give Mitt Romney even more ammunition for his charge that this president has instituted more economy crushing regulations than any in modern history. And so the Obama administration has simply ignored the law. This disregard has become a bit of habit with this administration, as it seeks to down play any details or news that might get in the way of its campaign narrative. Earlier this fall it directed Defense contractors to ignore federal law that requires them to send out layoff notices that will result from the upcoming Defense sequester cuts. Similarly, the administration failed to comply with congressional deadlines to supply information about how those sequester cuts would be implemented. Because the deadline fell on the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte—and would have rained on the president's headlines—the administration simply failed to turn the report in until a week later. There are some numbers Mr. Obama can't hide from, like this Friday's jobs data. But when it comes to his own plans for regulating the country, the president who pledged to be the most transparent in history would prefer to keep voters in the dark.</Msg><Username>farml1234</Username><Timestamp>1351823281423</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 22:28:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351823321254-148</Id><Topic><Title>Hey NYC,... out of food, shelter, water, fuel, patience and heat and freezing to death?

This is incorrect. Mike Bloomberg was a one time Democrat who became a Republican of convenience so he could run for Mayor of New York City. Republican Party is so weak in NYC that Bloomie could just buy his way in. If he remained Democrat he would have had vicious primaries against other Democrat Lilliputians who believed they were entitled to become mayor first. He remained a Republican during Bush years since that was convenient for NYC. He became an Independent &amp; nominal Democrat during Obama's term since that is now convenient for NYC.

I won't even kill a spider and the Kenyan kills people as though it's as meaningless as stepping on an ant. He murdered 4 Americans in Benghazi and the father of one of the SEALS was on FOX crying calling the Kenyan a murderer wanting him to confess while the Kenyan was busy partying in Vegas laughing it up and having the time of his e vill sinister opulent elitist arrogant narcissistic decadent cold callous life as the father's son lay cold and lifeless in the earth because no one would COME TO HIS F HUCKING SIDE because the Kenyan told them to stand down for 7 long hours. Stand down. Stand down. standdown. The cover up makes all the sense in the world and so does him sealing all of his fast &amp; furious records and real birth certificate, not the 9-layer electronically forged one. It all implicates the Kenyan spy of murder and espionage against the U.S. Remember when he thought his mic was off telling America's enemy, Medvedev, what he would do for him and Putin after he was "reelected." He's no American even if he was born in this country,..... which he wasn't.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351828550944</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-01 23:55:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
