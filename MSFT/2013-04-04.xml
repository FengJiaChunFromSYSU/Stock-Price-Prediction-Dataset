MONEY, MONEY EVERYWHERE In its efforts to jumpstart the economy, the U.S. central bank has undertaken since November 2008 three rounds of bond-buying and cut short-term interest rates effectively to zero. The purchases of mostly Treasury and mortgage securities - known as quantitative easing and nicknamed QE1, QE2 and QE3 - have injected trillions of dollars into the financial system. The Fed isn't alone. Central banks from Tokyo to Frankfurt to London are running their printing presses overtime. The heavily indebted advanced economies are trying to reflate their way out of the prolonged bout of crisis and recession that crystallized with the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc in 2008. That crisis, of course, followed a nearly decade-long cycle of easy money and exotic financial products that itself began with the collapse of the tech-mania bubble of the late 1990s. The Fed's program, while aimed at bolstering the U.S. housing and labor markets, has also steered billions of dollars into riskier, more speculative corners of the economy. That's because, with low interest rates pinching yields on their traditional investments, insurance companies, hedge funds and other institutional investors hunger for riskier, higher-yielding securities - bonds backed by subprime auto loans, for instance. Lenders like Exeter have rushed to meet that demand. Backed by Wall Street banks and big private-equity firms, they have been selling ever-greater amounts of subprime auto loans in the form of relatively high-yield securities and using the proceeds to fund even more lending to more subprime borrowers.</Msg><Username>doely_1</Username><Timestamp>1365075239146</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 07:33:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365076410120-5</Id><Topic><Title>Amazing simple mindedness of the board RWNJ trolls about the economy.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1365003036170</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:30:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nope not wrong, AND my version has more "truthiness" to it than ursdoes.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1365076410120</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 07:53:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365079295729-6</Id><Title>Bloomberg TV: "Nobody talks about Microsoft any more, do they?"</Title><Msg>No, they don't, now that you mention it....</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365079295729</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 08:41:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365082016972-7</Id><Topic><Title>Amazing simple mindedness of the board RWNJ trolls about the economy.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1365003036170</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:30:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cfury a t ypical ignorant, worthless leftist.

Quoting: "Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s software analyst, Kash Rangan, downgraded Microsoft from Buy to Neutral with a lower price target of $33. "CJ Takeaway: Since Microsoft first broke $20 in March 1998 except for the tech bubble when the shares almost touched $60 and got as low as $15 in March 2009 the stock has largely been range-bound between $24 and $31 for the past decade. With smartphones and tablets putting pressure on some of the company’s core businesses I would expect the shares to continue to remain range-bound unless it starts to gain solid traction in the mobile space. "BofA/ML lowered its revenue and EPS projections for fiscal 2013 and 2014. The 2013 EPS took the largest hit with its growth rate going from 6.3% down to 1.1%." __________________________________________________ As I've said before, Microsoft really can't afford to lose the mobile war, so it will definitely keep trying.

[In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services.[1] Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0% (a negative inflation rate). This should not be confused with disinflation, a slow-down in the inflation rate (i.e., when inflation declines to lower levels).[2] Inflation reduces the real value of money over time; conversely, deflation increases the real value of money – the currency of a national or regional economy. This allows one to buy more goods with the same amount of money over time.]</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1365089157985</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 11:25:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365089227185-26</Id><Topic><Title>Amazing simple mindedness of the board RWNJ trolls about the economy.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1365003036170</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-03 11:30:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You NEVER prove anything, just run ur yap, dats all</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1365089227185</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 11:27:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365089515811-27</Id><Topic><Title>Bank of Japan injecting massive Yen into its financial system to avoid deflation.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1365087573398</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 10:59:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pretty funny when the mowrawn hawfaeces gets bamboozled by economics- even simple economics like deflation/inflation and the causes for these phenomena</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1365089515811</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 11:31:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365090260047-28</Id><Title>Want to get in on a wild ride toady?

But as demand moved from desktops to laptops and then to tablets and smartphones, Microsoft lost its market reign to Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL). A report released today by Gartner, the technology research and advisory firm, forecasts that by 2017 shipments of devices using Google’s Android operating system will dwarf shipments of Windows PCs and phones. Shipments of Apple iPhones and iPads will be almost at parity with devices powered by Microsoft. “Microsoft could be completely irrelevant in three or four years if they can’t make headway in the smartphone or tablet market, where they’ve been struggling,” says The Daily Ticker's Henry Blodget. The numbers are staggering. Gartner forecasts that by 2017 the number of tablets, mobile phones and ultramobile devices will total 2.7 billion units—almost 10 times the number of desktop and notebook PCs. The stock market already reflects this shift in the device market. “The market is basically saying [Microsoft] is not a growth story. It's treated almost like a wasting asset, if you look at the current books and current cash flow,” says Michael Santoli, senior columnist at Yahoo! Finance. Related: Apple on the Defensive as Samsung Prepares to Launch Huge New Phone Microsoft shares are down nearly 9% year-over-year while Google shares have rallied over 25%. While Apple's shares have fallen a startling 31% year-over-year, many would argue that these numbers aren't indicative of sales and cash flow but instead of leadership changes and more competition. The challenge Microsoft faces now is how to stay relevant. Can it catch up in the tablet and smartphone market, where it’s been operating for years without much success, or must it try something completely different? Santoli says Microsoft may need to acknowledge that it can’t “just survive based on its old architecture.” He says the company is trapped by its “near monopoly business that makes so much money” which doesn’t inspire much risk taking.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365119416013</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 19:50:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365120327355-83</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft is in Trouble</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365116249396</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 18:57:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Android is an operating system for the mobile web. Mobile web applications don't likely run on the computer but mostly run on a website. Mobile web applications largely require a wireless connection to a website. File storage is mostly on a website or transfer to a desktop computer. And otherwise, look for the quad-core Atom processor to be a blockbuster for tablet computers. That processor will run Android but more likely will run full-Windows. Then file storage can be on the computer and applications like Photoshop Elements can be run. In fact, the desktop computer can be for file storage even for those who otherwise don't know what a desktop computer is for. That's a desktop computer for file storage instead of paying $50 a month for file storage that requires laborious upload and download.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1365120327355</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 20:05:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365121037218-84</Id><Topic><Title>Statistical Arbitrage, or how CFury made a complete fool of himself again</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1365106183958</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 16:09:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well actually no.

RT was just a interim product to come out with something while waiting for INTC to get its act together. I'm looking forward to getting a new laptop too when the new chips come out. I think it is best if you put off judgment on MSFT for 6 months to a year. I've downloaded and tried a lot of the free stuff ... made me appreciate MS. Firefox was the only thing I liked when I was using an old laptop (and I prefer the IE10 on my desktop) One thing I don't like is this Google chrome infiltrating my laptops when I forget to uncheck a "hidden" box when downloading something else. It spreads like a cancer, hangs toolbars everywhere and I have to go through and disable it and uninstall chrome. It even made google my home page. A real pain.

Because Microsoft isn't giving its customers the choice to keep the same thing. It's forcing, or trying to force, them to leave XP behind and learn something different and, by all reports, very confusing and frustrating. And this is not the first time Microsoft has done that; the story is the same for the so-called Ribbon Interface, which I've never heard a good word about.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365133547825</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 23:45:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365134209553-106</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's 5% Salary Give Back</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1365130236568</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 22:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah hawcreek12 he never does anything right, even giving his own money away isn't enough to earn him a spot in the "white" "haus."
