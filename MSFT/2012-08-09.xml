This year, there have already been 191 emergency room visits in upstate New York as a result of using bath salts. These visits show a drastic increase from the 39 reported visits in 2011. *** Naturally, Governor Andrew Cuomo thinks we need new regulations to "combat" this. How about this: Allow the idiots to die and send their families a posthumous Darwin Award. Thank you for being thoughtful enough to exit the human gene pool!</Msg><Username>waddaboutboosch43.duck</Username><Timestamp>1344486967000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 00:36:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344487214000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama and the Olympics!</Title><Username>goodgal000000001</Username><Timestamp>1344480130000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 22:42:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Very funny!</Msg><Username>waddaboutboosch43.duck</Username><Timestamp>1344487214000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 00:40:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344487261000-3</Id><Topic><Title>The BIG Difference between Romney &amp; Obama!</Title><Username>goodgal000000001</Username><Timestamp>1344479563000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 22:32:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FIVE STARS!</Msg><Username>waddaboutboosch43.duck</Username><Timestamp>1344487261000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 00:41:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344488293000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Obamaffoonery is thinking Americans believe the Obamanure!</Title><Username>obadidoss</Username><Timestamp>1344481709000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 23:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dildo is just one of the sado/masochistic types that we have seen before like T McVeigh</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1344488293000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 00:58:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344488407000-5</Id><Topic><Title>BIRTH CONTROL QUEEN FLUKE IS INTRODUCING OBAMA AT CONVENTION.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1344476807000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 21:46:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who is introducing Willard?? some mafia chieftan?

As far as I can tell, the entity now posting under the handle "krarners-ghost" is a (virtual) machine that is broken, and it is not capable of fixing itself. The likelihood that it will remedy its defects in response to anything you or I say being pretty nearly nil, the only way it will get fixed is for its designer (i.e. programmer) to bear a hand. And the likelihood of that is also pretty near nil, because it is succeeding at its intended purpose, as I see it, namely to hurt us in real-life terms, specifically by WASTING OUR TIME. It can't hope to convince anyone with more than half a brain of anything, so we have to consider that convincing anyone of anything is not its purpose. What it does succeed at, and consistently, must be its purpose; otherwise it would not continue to exist and consume resources.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1344516552000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:49:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344518742000-9</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;WASTING OUR TIME&lt; *yawn* the TROLL rings in.
