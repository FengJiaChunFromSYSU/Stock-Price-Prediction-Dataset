With that, the next generation of gaming is closer than ever to becoming the current generation.... Gamers will physically see the next generation of gaming when Microsoft puts the new Xbox console on display. Although it is merely a case hiding the important components of the system, seeing the console design is important to consumers. In addition to the look of the next Xbox, expect to hear concrete release information and pricing details. Speculation suggests a $500 price tag for the next Xbox with launch likely to occur in November. Microsoft will also likely give the full specs of the console. The presentation will go beyond that as the power of the system will be put on display with tech demos. Expect Microsoft to stick to its current trend of integrating Windows 8 across all their devices. The event will showcase the ease-of-use in the system, especially with the improved gesture controls in the next iteration of the Kinect. An upgraded Kinect system is expected to be built into the new console. Xbox has expanded beyond gaming into a huge brand for Microsoft. The company will treat the next console accordingly. Many Xbox 360 owners already use entertainment apps such as Netflix and YouTube on a daily basis. Microsoft has been building on relationships with entertainment providers behind the scenes and that will be reflected in the press conference. The next step is making the console a replacement set-top box complete with cable TV access and digital recording capabilities. Hardcore gamers may immediately turn off the event when this is announced but the next Xbox has its sights set higher than just the core gaming audience. However, gamers should be happy with game streaming and recording options expected to be announced at the event. Players will be able to upload directly onto streaming sites like Twitch.tv.

Company profit is limited by competition - they can't simply make as much money as they want, my little mush-minded kook. And yes, they do think of themselves(owners/shareholders), just as Microsoft thinks of us, owners of a share of the company. You have invested your money into it. But they do also think of their employees - a fair wage for the level of work done. A "living wage" means no more than that you have to "live" on whatever "wage" you have prepared yourself to earn. A person who has only educated or skilled themselves to assemble or cook Twinkies, demanding more than around $10 an hour is far more greedy (and simply ridiculous BTW) than an entrepreneur seeking a 2 - 6% after-tax net profit, whether it's 6% of $100,000 or $100,000,000,000. {Why don't you go out and work for $8/hr instead of posting here 16/7? See what it's like to earn that and live on it.} Been there. Done that. I was working for $7 an hour in the 90's at two jobs while paying for community college, living in a cr@ppy apartment and eating Ramen noodles. School cost about $600 a semester plus books then, full time. Wasn't that hard - anyone with a modicum of personal integrity and a desire for more than an apartment, fast food and a 10-year old car could do it. The American way of life is what each of us makes it, individually. Period. As an able person you can live on $30K of taxpayer handouts for the rest of your life, or earn any level of income you are willing to educate, train, or work yourself up to. And no one is against you, little kook. Not even that smart #$%$, college boy line boss. You'll grow out of that soon enough.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1367248822689</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 11:20:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367249398527-39</Id><Topic><Title>Stephanopoulas and other lackeys all smiles Sunday on "this Week"</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1367248779771</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 11:19:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The non-partisan Government Accountability Institute is reporting that Obama spent 106% more time on vacations and golf (976 hours) than working on economic issues (474 hours) since the Great Recession ended 4 years ago.

Something has changed. ORCL is down and down on sequestration. And all of these tech companies have large sales to the Federal government. It just hasn't hit yet.

She is also Washington bureau chief and political editor for Talkers Magazine. In addition, she often provides the left-wing viewpoint as an analyst on the Fox News Channel. On Thursday, Ratner published an article titled "George W. Bush Has Saved More Lives Than Any American President." "George W. Bush, not Barack Obama, is the real American hero in Africa," she amazingly began. "Take it from me, a liberal Democrat who voted for Obama twice." "Back in early 2008, when I started my work in South Sudan--I have been working closely with Christian Solidarity International--everyone was excited about the possibility of Barack Obama becoming president. Indeed, after Obama won the U.S. election in November of 2008, many Africans, in South Sudan, and everywhere else, were proud to wear T-shirts with photos of President Obama on them." "Yet now that Obama’s first term has drawn to a close, the positive buzz about Obama has dramatically shifted; the Obama excitement, and the T-shirts, have most disappeared. In fact, South Sudanese today are thinking more about another U.S. president: that would be Obama’s predecessor, Bush 43. As a liberal Democrat and Obama supporter, I was particularly struck by this. Yes, Bush is a hero in Africa, and Americans, too, should know why." "No American president, before or since, has had Bush’s vision and determination to save so many millions of lives. Five million children, women and men have received antiretroviral treatment under PEPFAR. Yes, millions of people live productive, healthy lives due to Bush 43." "This liberal commentator thanks president and Mrs. Bush every single day for their amazing and tireless work for humanity. They are wonderful role models for future leaders around the world. I wish more leaders would follow the shining example of George W. and Laura Bush."</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1367267091965</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 16:24:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367267106196-70</Id><Title>XBOX - IllumiRoom (Source PCWorld)....</Title><Msg>Folks this is incredible technology and a must read....

Like all phones equipped with the Windows Phone 8 OS, it uses fun and intuitive Live Tiles to keep the information that’s most important to you front and center. The ATIV Odyssey also shares features like; People Hub to gather your contacts, conversations, social media posts and photos into one place; and Xbox Games and Xbox Music, which are preloaded to keep you gaming and entertained. But the Samsung ATIV Odyssey also has some unique features worth noting. Preloaded apps The ATIV Odyssey comes preloaded with several apps developed by Samsung. First, there’s the Samsung-exclusive Now app that is set up as a Live Tile in order to help you get access to weather, Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance and top tweets with a simple swipe. To complement the 5-megapixel camera and 1080p HD video recording, the ATIV Odyssey comes preloaded with the excellent Photo Editor app. Resize, rotate and crop your photo; apply filters; decorate with frames; and adjust the color with controls for brightness, contrast, saturation and more. The Mini Diary is another great app that you’ll find on the Samsung ATIV Odyssey. It lets you create a diary to record your daily activities and then attach pictures and drawings to the entry. That entry can then be shared on Facebook or locked with a password and backed up via SkyDrive if you’d rather keep things a little more private. Other awesome upgrades Need a display that is tough but crystal clear? The ATIV Odyssey’s 4-inch Super AMOLED™ display reinforced with Corning® Gorilla™ Glass 2 brings the beauty and the brawn. Want more memory? Not a problem—there’s a microSD™ slot for memory expansion.

Back in August 2012, the jury ruled in favor of AAPL, awarding Apple some $1.05 billion in damages from Samsung for infringing on its utility and design patents covering the iPhone and the iPad. Although the trial is not over — Judge Koh could decide to throw out some or all of the jury’s decision, — the verdict represents a substantial victory for Apple and its claims that Samsung’s mobile phones and tablets copied key elements of Apple’s flagship products. Apple’s late co-founder Steve Jobs famously decried Android as a “stolen product,” and although Apple’s suit was specifically against Samsung, in some ways the South Korean company served as stand-in for the entire Android ecosystem, representing not just fellow phone makers like HTC, Asus, LG, and Sony, but also Google itself. The jury’s decision doesn’t mean Apple has killed Android "yet". However, Android device makers are going to have to think carefully about their products going forward — and Samsung is probably going to suffer a setback in the U.S. market. Will Samsung’s Android phones disappear from the market? samsung-galaxy-s-III Maybe some of them. Assuming the California jury’s decision of favor of Apple stands, Apple’s next logical move will be to seek import bans on Samsung devices that the jury has found to be violating its patents. That’s a lot of products — including the Galaxy S and Galaxy S II smartphones offered by a variety of U.S. carriers.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367277914999</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 19:25:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367278141343-94</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL vs Android....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367277914999</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-29 19:25:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AND today, Samsung Electronics (005930) Co. lost a bid to delay a new trial over damages for some its products found by a U.S. jury in August to have infringed Apple Inc. patents. U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, refused today to grant the Suwon, South Korea-based company’s request to put the damages trial on hold while a U.S. appeals court weighs Samsung’s challenge to the validity of the iPhone maker’s patents. Apple, seeking to streamline the new trial so it can begin in September, or earlier, argued that Samsung has “dragged its feet at every turn” in an attempt to delay its start, according to a court filing. Koh ordered the new trial on damages last month at the same time as she cut $450.5 million from last year’s $1.05 billion jury award against Samsung. She said the jury based its award for 14 Samsung products on an incorrect legal theory. The judge today cut one product from the group.
