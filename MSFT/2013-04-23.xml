"FORTUNE -- At its heart, the tech industry is about the new. Today, tech giants succeeded because of what was new yesterday. The flip side is that the new ages into the old more quickly in tech than in most other industries. And so companies that dominated tech even a decade ago can appear to be aging quickly.

While the individual results and subsequent reactions among investors varied, one thread ran through all three: Each is struggling to manage older businesses in decline even as they push into promising new areas like cloud computing...... "Ballmer envisioned Windows 8 as a way to pull Microsoft away from traditional PCs like laptops and desktops and into tablets and smartphones.

"Open Source software is important to everyone: The benefits of this collaborative innovation model do not flow to just one company; rather, the fruits of the work are available throughout the economy and empower many technology products and sectors. For example, in the Defense sector, open source software is driving more agile and rapid technology deployment on the battlefield2, and powers the operating system of the U.S. Navy nuclear submarine fleet. It is the technology that sustains weather forecasting, drives space exploration3, and was crucial to recent mission successes such as Mars Curiosity rover, which provided ‘big data’ results as widely available as possible.4 Reflecting the Administration’s ‘Open Innovation’ agenda5, www.whitehouse.gov utilizes open source software. The Administration actively encourages “using and contributing back to open source software as a way of making it easier for the government to share data, improve tools and services, and return value to taxpayers.”6 Stock exchanges around the world prefer open source software; indeed, most worldwide trading volume runs on Linux.7 Various consumer products rely on open source software, including mobile phones, wireless routers and automotive software.8 BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) widely implements the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols, part of the core Internet standards, and is open source software.9 Open source has also revolutionized enterprise IT architecture and economics. Ten years ago, a startup would have spent precious investment capital on infrastructure and Web software. Today, open source software reduces or eliminates the friction of starting a new venture, since “open-source infrastructure software is free and the Web hosting account might go for $5 a month."</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1366720239095</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 08:30:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366720520322-27</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro Tops Again List of Best Windows 8 Tablets, Hybrids....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366718194826</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 07:56:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Best W8 tablet?

I've already written about what I consider the folly of Microsoft's 15% off discount for XP holdouts, but this past week it was driven home to me just how bad the problem is, at least in some quarters. On Friday, I headed to the nearby Costco for an eyeglasses check. After all, you can't beat a $49 eye exam and it's as good as anything else I've had for much higher cost. Looking at the doctor's computer, I saw the familiar yellow shield with an exclamation point in the system tray. "Looks like it's time for you to update," I said to the doctor as she typed away. "I wish I could but I can't afford it," she replied. It turns out she misunderstood me. I just meant running Windows Update. But it opened the door to a conversation on why she is still using an XP machine that is quite old. When you can watch windows redraw as they open and close, you know your PC is slow. The problem wasn't getting a new PC, she could swing that. The problem was that the specialty software she uses that had been upgraded for Windows 7 required an upgrade fee of close to $10,000. Something tells me 15% off Windows 8 will not make up the difference for that cost."</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1366737222534</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:13:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366737287020-82</Id><Topic><Title>Surprisingly Strong Quarter Suggests Microsoft Transition Is On Track</Title><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1366717013580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 07:36:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOOG is an information stealing monster,IMO their hardware/software is the most hackable on the planet,WIN8 is one of the most secure OSs you can have.........</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1366737287020</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:14:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366737397426-83</Id><Title>AAPL analogy</Title><Msg>every DOG has it's day.</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1366737397426</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:16:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366737411675-84</Id><Topic><Title>Windoze Phone is a total dud.</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366334198327</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 21:16:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Remind the tards</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366737411675</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:16:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366737476761-85</Id><Topic><Title>SO far today, it is all short selling by the big boys....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366734986596</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 12:36:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1366737476761</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:17:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366737497852-86</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro Tops Again List of Best Windows 8 Tablets, Hybrids....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366718194826</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 07:56:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so shorefish best high end machine you can buy. why it not sell now and why you say it lose out on sale to new clone that coming? this sound inconsistent.</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1366737497852</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 13:18:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366737590991-87</Id><Topic><Title>SO far today, it is all short selling by the big boys....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366734986596</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 12:36:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>WE just had a huge short by the GS and recovered in no time....

But what few seem to realize about this transformation is that the sheer stress of living in today’s America is driving tens of millions to the point of illness, depression and self-destruction. Consider the following trends: Ads by Google Suicide has surpassed car crashes as the leading cause of injury death for Americans.

LOL, reminds me of when the new kids on Wall Street were saying that the market has transormed during the dotcom era, that earning don't matter. Well we are undergoing a transformation from prosperous to poor, to a more divided income level, the disparity has not been greater in modern times. To a bankrupt debter nation, to one with no concern for future generations as we spend their money so we can pretend everything is okay. To a much more divided nation as the child in chief uses every event for a political stage, vis a vis the air traffic controller lie now ongoing.</Msg><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1366747106615</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 15:58:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366747734343-121</Id><Topic><Title>Haswell will ignite MSFT</Title><Username>rbrentbyrne</Username><Timestamp>1366730653577</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 11:24:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For Core architecture-class performance Haswell's gain in battery life is near revolutionary.

Come on now, it's silly. He made a big bet on Softy is all. Many manages make big bets. That was a foolish and misinformed bounce. Worse is the activist stated he "will not do any public campaigning to affect Microsoft's strategy." So basically he's just another long in Softy. What's even scarier is he stated to his audience about how they should make Office available on iPads. On the surface it sounds good but he clearly doesn't have clue of just how the technology works and that it goes directly against what Softy is trying to accomplish now. I wouldn't put a dime in because of his thesis and people are coming to realize this. It going back down.

Quoting: "The first batch of phones based on the Mozilla Foundation's open source Firefox OS has sold out, mere hours after they were announced for sale. "As we press the big, red Publish button on this story, Geeksphone, the Spanish startup that designed and built the devices, has shut down its online store, replacing it with a notice indicating that no more handsets are available. "The site promises that sales will resume "in the following hours," but there was no indication as to just how many devices will be made available in total. "Geeksphone isn't the first company to experience such high demand for a new smartphone. For example, the Nexus 4, Google's most recent flagship Android smartphone, met with similar supply problems. "What makes the run on Geeksphone's devices so remarkable, however, is that the devices were intended for developers only, as Firefox OS is still in a fairly raw state. " 'These devices are strictly for developers looking to test and create apps for Firefox OS,' a Mozilla spokesman told El Reg on Monday. 'These devices have not been designed for consumers and include a pre-release development version of Firefox OS.'

It’s been all quiet on the Surface front for a while. Microsoft announced back in February that it would be broadening the availability of the RT version of its tablet, introducing it into 13 more European countries, but since then we haven’t had any other real news. That’s all about to change though, as Microsoft has finally delivered an update regarding worldwide availability for its Windows 8 Pro powered device. According to the technology giant, Surface Pro will be available from May in the following territories: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Korea, Malaysia, Russia, Singapore, and Thailand will get the tablet a month later. It’s already available to buy in the US, Canada, and China. There’s no word yet on little things like retail availability (if it will just be available online or in actual shops) or pricing for that matter, but Microsoft says it will reveal all in due course closer to the actual launches. Which suggests it’s still ironing out the details. Don't be too surprised if you can only buy it online in your part of the world though, as RT is only available from brick-and-mortar stores in very few countries. The RT version of the tablet is also getting expanded distribution and will launch in Malaysia on April 25th, in Mexico by the end of May, and in Korea and Thailand at some point in June. Announcing the news, Brian Hall, General Manager Microsoft Surface says: The enthusiasm for Surface has been fantastic, and we love hearing the stories of people who are making it the one device they use to work and play.

From BusinessInsider..... --------------------------------------- Microsoft Has Only Sold About 1.5 Million Surface Tablets So Far Julie Bort | Mar. 14, 2013, 8:39 PM | 5,395 | 36 Microsoft has reportedly sold less than 1.5 million Surface tablets, report Bloomberg's Ian King and Dina Bass. According to Bloomberg's sources, Microsoft has sold about 1 million Surface RT tablets—the model that runs only Windows 8 applications. It was introduced in October. And it sold about 400,000 Surface Pro tablet PCs, the model that runs Windows 7 and Windows 8 software, that became available in January. These same sources said the company had ordered production of 3 million Surface RTs. So Microsoft didn't even sell half of those. It's not clear how many Surface Pro units it ordered. Microsoft's hardware partners have been lining up to bad-mouth the Surface, which competes with their products, and the Windows 8 operating system. Earlier this month, Samsung executive Jun #$%$-soo had a lot of negative comments about Microsoft in a meeting with reporters. "I think the Windows 8 system is no better than the previous Windows Vista platform," #$%$-soo said. Windows Vista—the predecessor to the better-received Windows 7 operating system—is widely regarded to be one of Microsoft's biggest failures. And partners like like Acer, Asus, and Fujitsu have also said that Windows 8 device sales were weak. It's not that consumers didn't want tablets. They just want tablets that don't run Windows. ------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366765387515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 21:03:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366765845713-171</Id><Topic><Title>Reminder: Obama &amp; Company wrecked the Economy</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1366679264236</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 21:07:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama fans were unable to refute a single one of the many serious charges I made against Dear Leader Obama and his gang of welfare mongering liberals.

I quickly downloaded Tumblr on a Nokia Lumia 920 on Tuesday and found that it looks fairly similar to the iOS version (slate blue background, same fonts), though the section titles (Dashboard, tags) have the signature WP8 style. The real difference in the Windows Phone 8 version of Tumblr is the way it appears on your home screen. When I navigated out of the app and pinned it to my start screen, the last image I viewed in the app appeared on the Tumblr tile. Images from Tumblr can also appear on your lock screen. Those are neat visual features that separate the live, personalized design of Windows Phone 8 from other mobile operating systems. Tumblr, like other social networks, is expanding its mobile presence, so apps on all platforms fit with that strategy. The company said Monday it will begin rolling out ads (essentially promoted posts on your Dashboard) on the mobile version of its site as well as within the iOS and Android apps. (Presumably the WP8 app will also be included in that ad rollout). These are the "first of many" ad launches Tumblr has planned this year, Tumblr vice president of sales Lee Brown said in a Monday blog post. Top-tier apps have trickled into Microsoft's mobile app store in the months since its launch, and Tumblr is the latest to finally offer up a WP8 app. Spotify and Pandora also recently introduced Windows Phone 8 apps. But Windows Phone is only adding to its store what iOS and Android have had for years. Windows Phones such as the Nokia Lumia 920 have their fans, but without a robust app store, it continues to be difficult for Microsoft to woo users away from other operating systems.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366766629500</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 21:23:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366766839588-177</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro coming to the 'rest of the world' from next month (Source betanews)</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366764926766</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 20:55:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AAPL earnings were down 18% while MSFT was up 18% from the quarter a year ago....
