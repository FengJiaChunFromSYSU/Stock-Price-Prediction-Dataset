" I would doubt such a direct order exists, if it did it is well concealed. He knew or should have known in June 2012 and did nothing. Do you think Assad is personally ordering each civilian in Syria to be killed? Leadership sets the tone and Obama is the most partisan President in my lifetime. Leadership sets the level of ethics and behavior expected, and Obama heads the most corrupt administration in American history. I bet Obama didn't order the IRS to do this, but someone high up did, and it's clear the perps thought Obama would approve, and Obama would have, had they not been caught.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368962644496</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 07:24:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368966078216-3</Id><Topic><Title>So David Einhorn is the Dumb Money on Apple (Source Zero Hedge)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368913365681</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-18 17:42:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AAPL's earnings for the current Quarter will be down 21.5% Y0Y while the rev. estimate are kept constant....

Actually the Obama regime does not even seem to be remotely embarrassed by the massive array of lies they have been caught in.

Despite all this nonsense we have sold 100 million W-8 licenses while IDC Trolls are blaming MSFT for 2% decline in PC sales and Forrester a couple days come out swinging at MSFT throwing more Trash at Mr. Softy.... THE FACT remains that in October 2012, both Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer said: "They expect slow adoption of Windows-8 by Enterprise as many of them just migrated to W-7 and that smaller companies, Consumers and some institutions that need Iron-Clad security, such as the DoD, will adopt W-8 faster than others.... SO here is the Deal, Windows 8 will start replacing W-7 as WP-8 and Windows-8 Tablets start killing iPad and iPhone in Enterprise and decimate Samsung and Android on the Consumer side in the next couple of Quarters.... AND the driving force will be, as I have pointed out previously: "Single OS for Mobility and Desktop" with full Integration with Office 365, Cloud, Skype and Xbox.

Quoting: "Despite Microsoft MSFT +2.29% shipping more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses, Redmond’s newest operating system is not making much headway in the enterprise world, with IT decision makers deciding to give it the cold shoulder. "So, what’s holding Windows 8 back? "Forrester Research analyst David Johnson believes that the problem lies with the fact that Microsoft’s newest operating system doesn’t bring anything of real value to the table. “ 'Enterprises just don’t see Windows 8 having value,' wrote Johnson in a recent report. 'They don’t see the value in the changes in Windows 8.' "Johnson goes on to list a number of reasons why businesses are shunning Windows 8, which range from finger-pointing at the new touch-centric ‘Modern’ user interface and the huge training and support burdens that it might bring with it, to the issue of “upgrade fatigue” as a result of the work done to eliminate Windows XP from corporate networks in favor on Windows 7." _________________________________ BTW we all know that shipping "licenses" is not the same as selling computers to end users...</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368999394255</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 17:36:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368999726595-44</Id><Topic><Title>The shorts are pinning their hopes on a market correction, but....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368819691738</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Concerns about a technical correction have been a hot topic for weeks, but as the three major U.S. stock indexes inch higher and higher to set record after record, many analysts are shrugging off the pullback worries. "There isn't a technical level that we have in mind at this point when making decisions. The momentum is really strong, and riding along that momentum is what we should have in mind at this point," said Cam Albright, director of asset allocation at Wilmington Trust Investment Advisors in Wilmington, Delaware. Regardless, the consensus in the short term is that the market will avoid two of Wall Street's most popular maxims - "sell in May and go away" and "summer doldrums" - and maintain the upward momentum. Even at these levels, a popular options gauge shows investors are placing optimistic wagers on the stock market, positioning for the current run-up to extend for the next three months. Earlier this week, the Credit Suisse Fear Barometer, known as the CSFB Index, fell 11.4 points over the past two weeks - the largest decline on record - and is now at a one-year low of 21.73.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368999726595</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 17:42:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369000024330-45</Id><Topic><Title>Media Trolls and Bashing Windows-8....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368991067266</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 15:17:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Folks as you have seen, the paid bashers in the IT media, with the exception of the CIO Magazine, have been battering Windows-8 under instructions from the Hedge Funds and Wall Street crooks...."

Is that tax exempt? That means Nova is funded by the government. And no, Pepeek is right as always, you should ignore the fact Obama has inherited some genes for pigmented, or brown, skin. It's better skin for sun, don't you know that. In Florida you must see all the tan people who are not really tan naturally. Just look at Obama as a tan white person and maybe your anger will dissipate. You never should ignore incompetency, and that's why we like Obam, and knock Bush.

The Post story anonymously quoted a staffer in Cincinnati as saying they only operate on directives from headquarters: As could be expected, the folks in the determinations unit on Main Street have had trouble concentrating this week. Number crunchers, whose work is nonpolitical, don’t necessarily enjoy the spotlight, especially when the media and the public assume they’re engaged in partisan villainy. Sign Up for the Politics Digest newsletter! “We’re not political,’’ said one determinations staffer in khakis as he left work late Tuesday afternoon. “We people on the local level are doing what we are supposed to do. . . . That’s why there are so many people here who are flustered. Everything comes from the top. We don’t have any authority to make those decisions without someone signing off on them.

There are probably more positions, like Obama's presidency today, where being black gets you a pass, as there are where being black is a holdback. Extremes of both are true, in the mainstream neither is true. No F500 business cares about anything beyond competence in the position. Obama's comment is pure pandering racism and encourages divisiveness and "chip on the shoulder" hatred.

The disgusting arrogance that the affirmative-action-president and the affirmative-action-secretary-of-state have displayed is a result of their believing that they're untouchable and will not be held accountable for their actions because of what they are. This Benghazi debacle is a glaring example of how incompetence and ineptitude are now overlooked and excused because political correctness doesn't allow for certain groups (blacks and feminists in this case) to be properly questioned – they are a protected class of citizen. And, this banana republic dictator has turned the IRS into his own private hit-squad against his enemies. Lets hope that the affirmative-action-president and the affirmative-action-secretary-of-state are held accountable for their deleterious behavior and that impeachment moves forward. I think that serious jail-time is in order for many in Barry's noxious regime – corruption is rampant all around this Marxist usurper of the American-dream – a good old-fashioned dunging-out is in order here.
