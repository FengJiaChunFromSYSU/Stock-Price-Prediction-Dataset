Canonical's Ubuntu Linux distribution has been working on its user interface for a few years now and yesterday Canonical founder Mark Shuttleworth showed off Ubuntu Web Apps, which will allow users to access web applications such as Facebook, Twitter and Gmail from the desktop. Canonical's Steve George said Ubuntu Web Apps will give web applications the "full range of desktop capabilities". He said, "We give applications the full run of our desktops, where they have their own icons and windows, but we trap the whole Internet inside one overworked application, the browser." Canonical said Ubuntu Web Apps initially will support Facebook, Twitter, Last FM, Ebay and Gmail web applications among others, for a total of 40. The outfit went to great lengths to show that an Ubuntu Web App is treated in the same way as a standard desktop application. George continued, "This new feature is part of our drive to make the web a first class part of Ubuntu. We've already turned 40 popular web sites into Ubuntu Web Apps and there are plenty more on the way. It's easy to integrate your favourite website or interface natively into the desktop, and share the result with all Ubuntu users." Canonical said it will ship Ubuntu Web Apps as part of its Ubuntu 12.10 release. µ The Inquirer (http://s.tt/1itsh)</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1342983069000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 14:51:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1342983201000-9</Id><Title>Dell to offer Ubuntu XPS 13 laptops this Autumn</Title><Msg>Dell to offer Ubuntu XPS 13 laptops this Autumn Dell to offer Ubuntu XPS 13 laptops this Autumn By popular demand By Lawrence Latif Thu Jul 19 2012, 15:11 TIN BOX FLOGGER Dell will take Project Sputnik out of limited development and offer an XPS 13 laptop pre-loaded with Ubuntu Linux to the masses later this year. Dell's Project Sputnik allowed developers to sign up for a cut price XPS 13 laptop running a slightly modified Ubuntu Linux 12.04 distribution that included additional standard software. Apparently Dell received such a good response that it will launch an XPS 13 SKU that comes with Ubuntu pre-installed in certain markets. Dell said the laptop, which is exactly the same as the XPS 13 that it presently ships with Microsoft Windows, will be pre-loaded with Ubuntu Linux 12.04 and include development software. Nnamdi Orakwue, executive sponsor of the Dell incubation programme that funded Project Sputnik said, "Project Sputnik is a great example of the employee-driven innovation we built Dell's incubation program to enable. This project represents the first of many new ideas Dell employees will test with customers or partners through the program, and we look forward to supporting Sputnik to be successful as it becomes a product this [Autumn]." Dell didn't reveal pricing of its Ubuntu XPS 13, however given that users won't have to pay the Microsoft tax it should be a little cheaper, unless Dell wants to keep Microsoft happy. The firm has previously offered machines pre-loaded with Linux, however this will be the first time it offers the option on one of its high-profile, high-end machines and it might make its competitors take note. µ The Inquirer (http://s.tt/1in7H)</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1342983201000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 14:53:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1342984830000-10</Id><Topic><Title>Dell to offer Ubuntu XPS 13 laptops this Autumn</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1342983201000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-07-22 14:53:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cool.
