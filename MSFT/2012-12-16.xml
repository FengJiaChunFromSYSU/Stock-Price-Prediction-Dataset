The M4 Type Carbine is a reproduction of the Colt M4 Carbine, but is usually only semi-automatic for legality within the U.S. civilian market. However, it can be ordered by military or law enforcement organizations with three-round burst or fully automatic capability.[2] The rifle accepts both .223 Remington and 5.56 x 45 mm NATO cartridges, and the barrel is hard chrome lined in both the bore and chamber. Unlike the current Colt M4 Carbine which features a 4-position telescopic stock, the Bushmaster has a 6-position. It is compatible with most standard AR-15 parts, and has the ability to accept all AR15/M16 type STANAG magazines. It is also one of many different AR-15 rifles Bushmaster manufactures which they have trademarked as "XM-15" rifles An M4 Type Post-Ban Carbine was developed for the 1994 United States Federal Assault Weapons Ban requirements. Since the ban expired in 2004, this rifle has essentially been replaced by the M4A2 and M4A3. However, some states in the U.S. have kept these laws, so the rifle is still being produced</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1355676789116</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 11:53:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355678128061-8</Id><Topic><Title>W9 is coming</Title><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1355675292553</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 11:28:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MSFt is trying its best to use Win 8 to gain traction in tablest and smartphones.

Nobody says 'Bing it.' Just another example of how Microsoft is losing market share. Bing, Zune, Kin, WP7, Vista and now Windows 8, are all examples of how Microsoft is clueless to what customers really want. Why should customers pay good money only to 'adapt' to something they don't want? Microsoft didn't learn anything from it's 'Vista Fiasco' mistakes.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1355713755259</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:09:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355713809640-38</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft says adapting to Windows 8 takes at most two weeks</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1355588937469</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 11:28:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It only takes a few minutes to buy a Mac instead.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1355713809640</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:10:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355713872881-39</Id><Topic><Title>buy monday or 12-31 or jan 2013-best entry point</Title><Username>raggwead</Username><Timestamp>1355692003677</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 16:06:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bets is to buy now. possble that the whole market will be up by 2-5% by the end of the year. also, MSFt may accelarate stock buybacks over the days before the end of the year, as they did last year. In addition, I think som efunds got rid of their MSft positions over the last a few weeks since the share were down so much, and these funds may decide to buy them back by the end of the year. The possibility of the shares going up by 3-6% over the next 2 weeks is very high.</Msg><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1355713872881</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 22:11:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355714061532-40</Id><Topic><Title>Visit to the Micfosoft store</Title><Username>clarkwy</Username><Timestamp>1355501052014</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 11:04:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MSFT stores do not need to be as busy asApple stores to be successful.

Surface is the first of its kind. Not only is msft selling the softwares but also making the hardwares. Msft is poised to take over the computer business, offering both touchpads and laptop in the same computer. 2) Trading at year's bottom; the only way is up. In fact msft has been dormant for too many years; it is time to be king once again. 3) The second most stable company next to apple inc. 4) Lots of cash 5) No other solid company to invest; everything else is too expensive.</Msg><Username>kevinvests</Username><Timestamp>1355718270199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 23:24:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355718289968-43</Id><Topic><Title>reasons to load up om MSFT</Title><Username>kevinvests</Username><Timestamp>1355718270199</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 23:24:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>boyah!</Msg><Username>kevinvests</Username><Timestamp>1355718289968</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 23:24:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355719876317-44</Id><Topic><Title>never waste a crisis or tragedy, the prototype event was 9/11 where the RWNJ used this as an excuse to kill 8k</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1355699196169</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 18:06:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>itz the new normal,,,,....,,,...,,..,,.,...,,..,,....,</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1355719876317</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-16 23:51:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
