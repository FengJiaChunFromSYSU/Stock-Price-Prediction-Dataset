He lost control of his U.S. House caucus. He lost a chance to limit the impact of tax increases to only the most wealthy. And he lost face. So far, he hasn’t lost his title as U.S. House speaker --in part because “no one wants that job,” said Ron Bonjean, a former aide to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican. “Right now it’s a hard job to have.” Boehner’s admission yesterday that he pulled his own deficit-reduction proposal from consideration because he didn’t have enough votes for it to pass is casting doubt on his leadership skills. To successfully manage an agreement now, Boehner, 63, will likely have to rely more on Democrats. “It weakens the entire Republican Party, the Republican majority,” said Representative Steven LaTourette, a nine-term Ohio Republican who is retiring after this session. “If you’re not a governing majority, you’re not going to be a majority very long.” THE RIGHT WING WHACK JOBS ARE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE PRIKS ON THE PLANET. THOSE PRIKS ARE DESTROYING THEIR OWN PARTY. ENJOY THE MELTDOWN PRIKS.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1356184252467</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 08:50:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356189808542-8</Id><Topic><Title>After 30 minutes: Windows 8 deemed unusable</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1356113202057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 13:06:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go #$%$ yourself, idiot....M$ is dying.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1356189808542</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 10:23:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356197608740-9</Id><Title>I know its hard to believe but using trading system TS 8.0 in just 3 days took 30% profit on UVXY</Title><Msg>UPDATE THESTOCKLION</Msg><Username>uvxyxiv</Username><Timestamp>1356197608740</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 12:33:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356204034783-10</Id><Topic><Title>After 30 minutes: Windows 8 deemed unusable</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1356113202057</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 13:06:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone stupid enough to buy Windows 8 deserves an unusable computer.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1356204034783</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 14:20:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356204187123-11</Id><Topic><Title>Obama hobbled by incompetence does America a favor</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1356189322022</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 10:15:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you thinki Bush paid for his vacaqtions?

Obama said “all of us agree” that rates shouldn’t go up for 98 percent of taxpayers when the new year starts. He also seeks to have unemployment insurance extended for about 2 million Americans who will lose benefits in January, and a commitment to deal with spending cuts next year. ******************************************************** Will Grover Norquist and his employer, The Koch Bros, allow the Tea Party thugs to give a tax break to 98% of working families?</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1356215073334</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 17:24:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356227514239-16</Id><Title>Barrons: MSFT is best in terms of Price/Free cash flow</Title><Msg>Read the weekend Barrons and MSFT is poised to rally at least 50% to high 30s.</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1356227514239</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 20:51:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356238315031-17</Id><Title>racist hawfaeces lies again</Title><Msg>Obama lies again. Certainly all don't agree. Since the rich pay 4 times the rate of the middle class already on average, the rate increase should not be targeted but go up on all or stay the same on all. Obama foments hate with his lies. this is a lie by the ignorant racist redneck hawfaeces- he continually rages and screams that Obama is a liar and he bolsters his argument with events he claims are lies- but the things he cites are not lies by Obama- the only lies are rolling out of hawfaeces mouth</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1356238315031</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-22 23:51:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
