Interesting that you recognize the existence of "legacy costs" (the obligation to live up to contractual responsibility on the part of the General Motors corporate entities) in the case of the workers who kept GM from mismanaging itself into bankruptcy long ago but ignore the impact of legacy obligations to our allies and our service members.

The fact that this is the way bankruptcy law works should be no shocking discovery to you since you've stiffed your employees and creditors in much the same way due to the failure of your "successful business" while your attention was entirely occupied with posting POLITICAL OPINIONS on this message board every day for at least the last ten years, most often in sixteen hour marathon sessions which devolve into greater and greater incoherence as they progress. Managerial employees of GM were bought out of their pension obligations by the election of a lump sum payment or a PRU managed annuity. Union workers negotiated a stake in the restructured company. F ain't doing that hot either. Its creditors take the risk that there's no return to the crazy that left F to be the fail leader in the industry (due to mismanagement, by the way, not due to the paltry compensation provided to its workers). Neither should concern you since your message board trolling career won't be impacted either by the success or failure of either enterprise. Shareholders are never ensured of any return on their investment and never should be. The business of an enterprise is not to make speculators or a hapless set of middle and upper "managers" wealthy but rather to keep the customer satisfied. Something you have always failed at, even in your message board posting career.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1347102824387</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-08 07:13:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347106599855-5</Id><Topic><Title>Only two months of Obamanure, then he is ejected by wide margin!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1347074142358</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 23:15:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not unless the RepublConMen come up with someone besides Mitt ( Mister Integrity ) Romney.
