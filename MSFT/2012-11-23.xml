(Including some leading republicans) you sound like the person who ran a loosing campaign and grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory. Take a special person to do that so you must be proud to stand in the same puddle of losers as mr romney. Keep up the good work though many republicans can breathe easy knowing there are far smarter people then those who think like yourself and mr Romney that will be running the part for 2016.

A huge crowd is now gathering in front of Microsoft’s Store in Bellevue at midnight, Twitter user Sachin Patil wrote, as Microsoft is offering a free sleeve for the first 100 tablets sold in every retail store. What’s more, every single Surface buyer who chooses the 32GB or the 64GB bundle will get $50 (€39) off a second Touch or Type cover. Leaving all these Black Friday deals aside, the Surface tablet is available in three different flavors, with the most affordable model wearing a price tag of $499 (€380). It comes with 32 GB of storage space, but the package does not include a Touch Cover.

Now, the deficits have been decreasing with Obama. The dollar strengthened with Obama. The economy is recovering with Obama. Report: Under Obama, Taxes, Deficit and Spending All Down Posted on May 16, 2012 Pete Souza Under President Obama, spending, taxes and the deficit have all decreased. Despite what Republicans and the tea party would like to have Americans believe, taxes, spending and the deficit are all lower than when President Obama took office. The fact is that Obama inherited a disaster of a federal budget. Eight years prior, when President George W. Bush took the oath of office, there was a $281 billion surplus. By the time Obama was sworn in, he was facing a $1.2 trillion deficit. Inconvenient though it may be for conservatives (especially those who are running for president), the truth is that spending, taxes and the deficit are all lower today than when President Obama took office.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1353681868900</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 09:44:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353681961877-16</Id><Title>30 next week with Shareholder meeting on Nov 30th?</Title><Msg>If they announce a special dividend we could get a significant pop.

It probably won't go bankrupt soon, but its day in the sun is past. Incidentally, the other day, author Steven Johnson (Future Perfect and others) was being interviewed on Book TV, and someone calling in asked him about this "open source" thing which had flourished back in the late 90's. Johnson said, correctly, that Open Source, with its poster child Linux, didn't go away. Quite the contrary, it's all around us. If magically it were to go away, the Internet would shut down, stock markets would shut down, airplanes would fall out of the sky, smartphones wouldn't work any more. Microsoft is belatedly warming up to Linux, but it's too late, Microsoft can't save itself that way.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1353695165214</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:26:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353695347201-49</Id><Topic><Title>Surface V IPAD</Title><Username>meadows_field</Username><Timestamp>1353694877912</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:21:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lying shill.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1353695347201</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:29:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353695599038-50</Id><Topic><Title>Substantial Update for MSFT Read Now!</Title><Username>jacksonj719</Username><Timestamp>1353694281307</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:11:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>got me a load more shares today</Msg><Username>johnnychristopher99</Username><Timestamp>1353695599038</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:33:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353696216949-51</Id><Topic><Title>Bush/Republican Tax Cuts For The Wealthy Created This Debt</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1353681868900</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 09:44:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read and learn you old baldheaded bass turds!</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1353696216949</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:43:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353696962683-52</Id><Topic><Title>Lugi says of Hurricane Sandy saving Obama</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1353671328119</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 06:48:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>:) .....</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1353696962683</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:56:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353698324450-53</Id><Topic><Title>Surface V IPAD</Title><Username>meadows_field</Username><Timestamp>1353694877912</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 13:21:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- If one wants to use a tablet to do some real work, then need to buy a Surface. - If one wants to have a tabklet to work the same way as his PC, then buy a Surface. - If one wants to use the same interface over the coming 10, 20 years, not just 5 years, go buy a Surface tablet.

Microsoft broke the 20,000 mark on Tuesday, according to Directions on Microsoft Windows app store watcher Wes Miller. Nearly 18,000, or 87 percent, of those apps are free, according to Miller. Those are worldwide numbers. The total number of apps available within regions vary. For example, the Canadian Windows 8 app store has some 14,000 programs, while the U.S. has 12,675; and the U.K., some 11,000. What must be heartening for Microsoft is the velocity at which apps are being added to its online market: some 500 new apps appear each day, according to The Next Web. At that rate, the store could reach 40,000 apps by the end of the year. Moreover, that climb should remain steep as buyers of new Windows PCs during the holiday season hunt for apps for their new computers for weeks to come, and developers feverishly seek to meet that demand. Nevertheless, app uploads must accelerate even more for Microsoft to meet its goal of 100,000 apps in the store within 90 days from the launch of Windows 8 on October 26. Comparing the number of apps in the Windows 8 store to the Apple App Store and Google Play can be misleading, though, since those outlets service mobile devices. A more suitable comparison might be made between the Windows store and Apple's Mac App Store. From January 2011 to April 2012, only 10,000 apps were added to that Apple outlet. Uploads at the Windows 8 app store have been a source of controversy for Microsoft in recent days. The sudden departure of the top dog in Microsoft's Windows division, Steven Sinofsky, was attributed by some Redmond watchers to Sinofsky's conflicts with CEO Steve Ballmer over the pace of growth at the app outlet.</Msg><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1353717607845</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 19:40:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353718760814-76</Id><Title>MSFT Surface on top of holiday gift wish list</Title><Msg>Now, this is getting really hot!!! http://live.wsj.com/video/surface-tablet-tops-holiday-wish-lists/A75792D8-BEDE-43CE-A826-F6B9651FF9D4.html#!A75792D8-BEDE-43CE-A826-F6B9651FF9D4</Msg><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1353718760814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 19:59:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353720089603-77</Id><Topic><Title>When is MSFT going to get its mojo back?</Title><Username>gjjagan</Username><Timestamp>1353693512304</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 12:58:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor excuse. just look at aapl it is twice in cap size to msft and yet it is nimble, innovating, outgunning the competition!</Msg><Username>gjjagan</Username><Timestamp>1353720089603</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 20:21:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353725702890-78</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT Surface on top of holiday gift wish list</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1353718760814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 19:59:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a crock!

They aren't serious computer users so...... Here's one problem I use programs that aren't simply apps, so what??? There is no start button any more so even finding your program is all sorts of fun, you can tweak that but it's a pain in the #$%$. Everything with Win 8 is a pain in the #$%$, there is a group out there who will say it's great but it will be a major fail for MS to cater to a small group of users when it owns the OS market. For me the laptop was a cheap toy to stream video to TV's some kids games that's why I didn't check out Win 8, how bad can it be??? Now I have a project to figure this stupid GUI out and make it run decently.</Msg><Username>creephhi</Username><Timestamp>1353731588660</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-23 23:33:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353732587373-80</Id><Title>HALO 4</Title><Msg>What company develops the halo games, etc?
