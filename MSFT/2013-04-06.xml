Sure, there's a learning curve, but there's a learning curve with Windows 8 Metro too. The Mac Mini is pretty cool for $599. You can connect it to your existing monitor, usb keyboard and mouse too. It's a good replacement for an XP machine when Microsoft stops supporting XP next year. You can also use Boot Camp to do a dual boot with OS X and XP to help with the cut over. Then when Microsoft's stops supporting XP, just stop using Microsoft completely.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1365221671496</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 00:14:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365221799062-3</Id><Topic><Title>Android to Power Google Notebook</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365179502270</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 12:31:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll buy one if I can get a 13 inch laptop for under $500.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1365221799062</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 00:16:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365223036936-4</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Could Be Obsolete By 2017: Gartner Report</Title><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1365119416013</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-04 19:50:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft will be obsolete in 2014 when they end support for XP.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1365223036936</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 00:37:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365223116236-5</Id><Topic><Title>WTH is happining with managment?</Title><Username>bret777</Username><Timestamp>1365174528374</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-05 11:08:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft management doesn't care about anything, except for cashing in their $25 stock options and selling them for $28.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1365223116236</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-06 00:38:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365224941080-6</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft in trouble?

Do you wonder why nearly have the systems running evil ware are still on the 5th failed attempt? Really only 6pct between 7th and 5th shows just how little the public wants to invest in any new evilware. At this point they can't compete with android and ios those eco systems will start to surge into the enterprize space as bring your own device buts up against it's closed monopoly software. The next big shoe to drop is office as there are many freeware programs that do everything it does. Cost save bonus managers will cop on and look to throw out office for products that will run on android and ios tablets. The complete lack of any security in their failed os attempts will push them out of the enterprise space. Look for an ever increasing rate of decline once office and the shift to more secure and stable os gains traction. They really need a totally fresh approach that is tech leading customer focused and anti monopoly. If they fired the fat greedy cost save bonus eating jabba and got rid of the evil one too then it would stand a chance to be around next decade.
