It was during the last election, he was arrested. It was throwing away registrations like you say, since you remember it quite well, better than Idid as to what documents. You have no proof of double voting, and no further proof, if it were true, it would be a democrat rather than a republican . Next time you get out of your chair to vote in two years, try to vote twice and report back. You won't be able to do it. You want people to vote your way, and if black people vote the way they want, you say it's wrong. You're stuck in the early 60's when black people were prevented from voting. You learned that, and here you are today.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1361339401654</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 00:50:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361339886666-4</Id><Topic><Title>Woman who voted up to six times for Obama admits doing so but says no fraud</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1361301287851</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:14:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gee you had an opportunity to say I stereotype republicans, but missed it.

I know that we had some disagreements over some issues and that you would have preferred that the GOP win the thing, but in the face of the reality of the outcome you are showing yourself to be a true patriot and you have my deepest respect. Hawcreek can flog a dead horse until he's blue in the face but it is much ado about nothing.

The change, which Immunity Security's Kostya Kortchinsky said occurred about two months ago, represents a major departure from the design that has powered Skype for the past decade. Since its introduction in 2003, the network has consisted of "supernodes" made up of regular users who had sufficient bandwidth, processing power, and other system requirements to qualify. These supernodes then transferred data with other supernodes in a peer-to-peer fashion. At any given time, there were typically a little more than 48,000 clients that operated this way. Kortchinsky's analysis, which has not yet been confirmed by Microsoft, shows that Skype is now being powered by a little more than 10,000 supernodes that are all hosted by the company. It's currently not possible for regular users to be promoted to supernode status. What's more, the boxes are running a version of Linux using grsecurity, a collection of patches and configurations designed to make servers more resistant to attacks. In addition to hardening them to hacks, the Microsoft-hosted boxes are able to accommodate significantly more users. Supernodes under the old system typically handled about 800 end users, Kortchinsky said, whereas the newer ones host about 4,100 users and have a theoretical limit of as many as 100,000 users. "It's pretty good for security reasons because then you don't rely on random people running random stuff on their machine," Kortchinsky told Ars. "You just have something that's centralized and secure." Kortchinsky discovered the Linux supernodes using a Skype probing technique he and colleague Fabrice Desclaux first demonstrated in 2006. (PDF versions of conference presentation slides are here and here.) Kortchinsky's discovery comes as Microsoft said it's investigating recent demonstrations of an exploit that exposes the local and remote IP addresses of users who are logged in to the service. The attack reportedly relies on the open-source SkypeKit package. =================================================================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1361385606100</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:40:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361386219971-74</Id><Topic><Title>what Microsoft can achieve in next few days?</Title><Username>rhodesfreddie</Username><Timestamp>1360928540810</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 06:42:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>great thanks!</Msg><Username>sammccarthy138</Username><Timestamp>1361386219971</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:50:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361386564500-75</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's Skype grows 100% 2Billion in annual sales</Title><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1361300105179</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:55:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another WINNER to add to M$FT's diverese business portfollio#$%$$$</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1361386564500</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:56:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361387632386-76</Id><Topic><Title>what Microsoft can achieve in next few days?</Title><Username>rhodesfreddie</Username><Timestamp>1360928540810</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 06:42:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow, thanks</Msg><Username>williamburrows228</Username><Timestamp>1361387632386</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:13:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361389003132-77</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's Skype grows 100% 2Billion in annual sales</Title><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1361300105179</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 13:55:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If only all of MSFT's ventures were this profitable.

"We didn't miss cell phones," Gates said. "But the way that we went about it didn't allow us to get the leadership, so it's clearly a mistake." Mind you, to say that Microsoft isn't leading with Windows Phone is a bit of an understatement. According to recent research from comScore, Microsoft's share of the smartphone market actually shrunk during the three months ending December 2012, leaving it with a paltry 2.9 per cent. That was less than half the share commanded by BlackBerry during the same period – a company to which pundits routinely feel compelled to attach such adjectives as "struggling," "embattled," "beleaguered," and so on. In 2011, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer confidently told a meeting of financial analysts that he had high hopes that Windows Phone would soon become the third most popular smartphone platform. But given the market performance of Windows Phone 8 so far, even that comparatively meager milestone still looks out of reach. ===================================================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1361391056755</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:10:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361391151662-88</Id><Topic><Title>7 top reasons to buy msft (All-in)</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1361169916009</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 01:45:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>0</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1361391151662</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:12:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361391263030-89</Id><Topic><Title>-##- MSFT Insiders SELLING?!

Dell, which is in the midst of a leveraged buyout, announced what can only be described as a disastrous set of full year financial results following yet another lacklustre quarter. The firm's fourth quarter fiscal 2013 results reported that revenues fell 11 percent to $14.3bn with profits dropping 31 percent to $530m year over year. Dell's fourth quarter figures rounded off what has been a year to forget for the firm, with its full year fiscal 2013 financial results showing an eight percent drop in revenues to $56.9bn with profits falling 32 percent to $2.3bn. During Dell's fourth quarter sales in all four of its business units fell with consumer sales dropping 24 percent. Even the firm's large enterprise and public sector business units saw revenues decline seven percent and nine percent, respectively, while its small and medium business unit reported that revenues fell five percent. Dell's regional sales in EMEA, the Americas and Asia-Pacific were down 14 percent, 10 percent and nine percent, respectively. For Dell there really was very little good news in the fourth quarter, other than perhaps it might not have to report quarterly financial results much longer, should Michael Dell successfully take the firm private once again. With such hopes, Dell didn't oblige investors with first quarter fiscal 2014 or full year fiscal 2014 forecasts, giving the industry a taste of what is to come. µ ============================================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1361395516445</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:25:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361396381828-101</Id><Title>little barry o is a pukestain</Title><Msg>and a major hypocryte</Msg><Username>richardswiss99</Username><Timestamp>1361396381828</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:39:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361397526502-102</Id><Topic><Title>Even Bill Gates says windoze phone is a disaster....</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1361391056755</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:10:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>First he needs to understand "a"...</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1361397526502</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:58:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361397967920-103</Id><Topic><Title>Even Bill Gates says windoze phone is a disaster....</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1361391056755</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:10:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I give all of hereturd's M$FT stupid hate posts THUMBS DOWN!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1361397967920</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 17:06:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361399026869-104</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Is Already Coming Out With A Whole New Version Of Windows</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1361369078985</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:04:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yup. The age of the NT kernel isn#$%$ worst fault, it's the complexity of it. No doubt it suffers from the "second system" syndrome, having been done by Cutler and company as their second system following VMS, which was already a monster. Already in about 2001, Ballmer was saying publicly that it wasn't "the system it should have been". That's an exact quote, as near as I can recall. But they've stuck with it. For some six years, they worked at making it even more complicated, which I could have told them was a serious mistake; the result was Vista. They seemed for a time to have learned the virtue of simplicity, but now they seem to have forgotten.

In a click, police know exactly what they're getting into. Such a hypothetical scenario may seem like something out of a futuristic crime drama, but the technology is real, developed in a partnership between the nation's largest police department and Microsoft Corp., and the latest version has been quietly in use for about a year. The project could pay off in more ways than one: The NYPD could make tens of millions of dollars under an unprecedented marketing deal that allows Microsoft to sell the system to other law enforcement agencies and civilian companies around the world. The city will get a 30 percent cut. The Domain Awareness System, known as the dashboard, gives easy access to the police department's voluminous arrest records, 911 calls, more than 3,000 security cameras citywide, license plate readers and portable radiation detectors. This is all public data — not additional surveillance.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1361416691446</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 22:18:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361420589877-118</Id><Topic><Title>Even Bill Gates says windoze phone is a disaster....</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1361391056755</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:10:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Twitch ...
