The MSFT desktop will be here for many years....because windows is by far the preferred operating system for the world. The mouse is here to stay....who wants to swipe their finger on a monitor. That's for teenagers. As long as the general public, including office personnel prefer the PC and mouse that's what we will have. It's okay to experiment with other techniques, but for now the serious work will be done on the traditional equipment. MSFT is up in after market trading. It may trade a bit lower, but the fundamentals....cash position, income growth, profit history, dividends, including annual increases..... will eventually prevail. Many factors affect one quarter sales results, for example Europe's economic difficulties. I agree that the sales trend for PC's has been down. Some of the defections may not return because tablets, notebooks and phones meet their needs, but common sense tells you that the majority of users are here to stay.</Msg><Username>johntjohnt_2000</Username><Timestamp>1365745100098</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 01:38:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365762688523-9</Id><Title>99% OF U.S.A INVESTERS LOSE WHEN SHORTSELLING STARTS.</Title><Msg>TRUE 3</Msg><Username>steveo23jack</Username><Timestamp>1365762688523</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 06:31:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365764833940-10</Id><Topic><Title>Love my WIN8</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1365734604356</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 22:43:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He said it's faster and more stable..DUH ..can't you read. This is not like going from WinXP to Vista to Win7 which was a massive leap. MS is trying to keep the same user experience with more features e.g tiles, etc. So going from Win7 to Win8 is a no brainer, there are just a couple of things that you need to know.

Quoting: 'This week, the PC community turned in its worst performance since IDC and Gartner started counting. Worldwide shipments were off by 14% year on year, according to IDC. Gartner says the decline was 11%. The two differ slightly in methodology. 'Those of us who have been following the industry since its inception have reason to be dismayed as to the causes. Yes, the market has shifted to high mobility devices (i.e., smartphones and tablets), but much of the pain among PC suppliers is self-inflicted. 'Of course, a fish can’t become a bird just because flying is in fashion. There are some limitations to a company’s ability to change what it does. But Apple proves the point that a computer company can become a high-mobility company. And, in fact, particular vendors’ degree of pain maps almost perfectly to the degree to which they have been able to make this transition. 'For example, Samsung has been making notebooks for years, but is now right in the middle of the Google-fed Android revolution in smartphones and tablets. Lenovo, an amalgam of IBM’s old PC company and the first major Chinese PC maker, has been moving into phones in China, India, Philippines, and Vietnam. Lenovo also offers a variety of tablets in developed markets. 'Dell and Hewlett-Packard (HP), on the other hand, have nearly non-existent positions in high mobility. Dell, with its emphasis on computing for businesses, has reacted to organizations’ slowness to adopt new technologies by being slow to introduce them. ..... 'However, the real responsibility for the current situation lies with the main suppliers: Microsoft and Intel.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365780506000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 11:28:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365780749786-55</Id><Topic><Title>Big Volume, Still a Buy?</Title><Username>hugh_dawg</Username><Timestamp>1359170136948</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-25 22:15:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I just read your article.

I do not like windows 8. It is faster than windows 7 but there are many bugs that need to be repaired and blindly supporting something will do anything to fix the problems. I do not want charms and apps I want what all my computers before had. If I had bought a tablet I would appreciate windows 8 since you can also have a desktop. But I like how a laptop works and feels compared to a tablet and for stock trading it is much easier to use since I have many windows open to follow stocks. I have had many problems with windows 8 like cookies disappearing, passwords to sites suddenly disappearing and reappearing video not working flash problems exe files not working due to updates damaging the registry. So far if I could get the same speed out of a windows 7 or XP I would gladly dump windows 8. I suggest to those here that do not have a windows 8 computer to go buy one and find out for yourself. I know others who have bought a computer with windows 8 and have returned them since they had so much problems with it.</Msg><Username>darnoc1111</Username><Timestamp>1365788880615</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 13:48:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365789146098-83</Id><Topic><Title>Five Reasons PC Sales Have Taken a Nose Dive</Title><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1365782835381</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 12:07:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's ok.

Within 2-3 days of getting my new desktop (and using just a mouse), I loved Win8. And for the "Start Button", I can get to the power button, control panel, other programs, etc. in Win8 just as fast as I could with the old Start Button ... using a mouse no less. Something is funny about all this bashing, because I don't see how it is warranted. I could certainly understand how the bashing is causing hesitation in taking the step to make a purchase ... though it is unwarranted. If the drop in PC's included laptops, I can understand that. Intel is coming out with a new chip in Q2 ... I want a new laptop and waiting for the new chip, and looking forward to having a laptop with Win8 on it. Later the same will go for tablet with ... waiting for Intel again.

I said the same thing to my fellow investing friends. JP has a whole division of traders who are shorting MSFT like crazy and now that it's about to rumble, they went into panic mode. The downgrade the day after the stock shot up speaks volumes about JP's credibility with regards to MSFT. They have none. That was one of the most transparent abuses of credility to cover a shorting positon I've ever seen in all my many long years of investing. Morgan's word means nothing anymore. Zip. Excellent post.

Windows 7 users should uninstall a security patch Microsoft issued on Tuesday because some PCs failed to restart after applying the update. The software giant advised users of Win 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2* to roll-back a patch within MS13-036, a security update that closed two vulnerabilities in the Windows file system kernel-mode driver. Exactly how one nukes the wobbly patch is explained here. The advice follows complaints that after applying the update computers would either fail to restart or applications would not load. Users who experienced problems were sometimes confronted by "fatal system error" warnings on start up, as illustrated by Sophos here. In a post on Microsoft's Security Response blog, Redmond blamed the glitch on conflicts with third-party software: We are aware that some of our customers may be experiencing difficulties after applying security update 2823324, which we provided in security bulletin MS13-036 on Tuesday, April 9. We’ve determined that the update, when paired with certain third-party software, can cause system errors. As a precaution, we stopped pushing 2823324 as an update when we began investigating the error reports, and have since removed it from the download centre. The buggy patch causes, among other headaches, Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Windows to display a message claiming its user licence is invalid, implying that the PC is unprotected from malware nasties. Other reports suggest that some machines have been thrown into a continuous reboot cycle: Win 7 PCs in Samba-loving Brazil are apparently hardest hit. .....................................</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1365807584222</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 18:59:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365809954466-136</Id><Topic><Title>Abortion Leads to a Degraded, Sub-Human Culture</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1365781775686</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 11:49:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"There is no god, you #$%$" prove it</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1365809954466</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 19:39:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365810191956-137</Id><Topic><Title>Abortion Leads to a Degraded, Sub-Human Culture</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1365781775686</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 11:49:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't have to.

Lets's say you have an empty back yard, and a group comes along and tells you get out because we want to use it more productively, what are you going to say to them, OK?</Msg><Username>ghosanonon</Username><Timestamp>1365815812466</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 21:16:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365816417992-144</Id><Title>Windows 8 is not just a pc it's an Experience 'Have you ever been Experienced'?</Title><Msg>Compare this to 7??? I do not think so. Click on the music Icon. Xbox is not just for gamers. Xbox music, not just music - an experience. Type in the name of an artist you like and it not only brings it up and you can play it for free but it also brings up a group of similar songs that will take you back in the day. Say you search an artist you liked in high school. All the songs that you also listened to will be magically right there in a grouped song list. You get to see cool pictures of the artist and read bio's. You can buy all the new music. You can play a large amount of music you for free and create your own play list. This you will love. Click the app store and download all the apps you can handle. There are as many for free as there are for pay. Download the Yahoo Finance App. The video experience on Windows 8 flows seamless as long as you have a broadband connection. There is not entertainment on 7. Windows 8 is an experience. You got to get this thing, it is fantastic.</Msg><Username>msftstockmachine</Username><Timestamp>1365816417992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 21:26:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365816498720-145</Id><Topic><Title>Maybe it's not as bad as they want you to think.</Title><Username>msftstockmachine</Username><Timestamp>1365796794877</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 15:59:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Right on brother.</Msg><Username>msftstockmachine</Username><Timestamp>1365816498720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 21:28:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365818092963-146</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 is not just a pc it's an Experience 'Have you ever been Experienced'?</Title><Username>msftstockmachine</Username><Timestamp>1365816417992</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 21:26:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Windows 8 is an experience."
