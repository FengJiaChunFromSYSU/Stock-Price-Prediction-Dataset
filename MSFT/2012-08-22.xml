Mitt Romney (because Ann made him do it) has declared that the Ann D. Romney Blind Trust has worked in some capacity throughout the year 2010 for Bain Capital Partners X (AM) LP and Bain Capital Partners X (AM) LLC receiving for that work zero strike options that Ann's blind trust (since she herself is simply a busy stay-at-home mom) would like to declare for tax purposes at a fair market valuation over the strike price. This allows a restricted stock award to be valued and declared as ordinary income for services performed by the Romney "blind trust" vehicles for the associated Bain Capital entity and the capital gains realized on the activities associated with the work rewarded to be treated at the 15% rate (if any). So MittAnn Inc. has 27Million in income that they want to tell the IRS about as well as a variety of distributions of restricted stock that they want to declare at a "fair market value" that will lock the ultimate conversion value of the holdings to the long term capital gains rate (if any) at the time of their disposition made through a Bain Capital shell organization awarded on the basis of the Ann D. Romney blind trust's ongoing participation in the operations of the associated Bain entities. With a few shufflings, MittAnn has caused those receipts to total out to slightly more than 21Million. MittAnn took their customary extension while whittling down their tax liabilities and carried over their prior year's refund so they pay 9thousand and change north of 3Million on a gross of 27 for a rate relative to gross income that they want to talk about outside of quiet rooms of 11%.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345633595000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 07:06:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345635680000-15</Id><Topic><Title>While the Media laughed over *Legitimate Rape*</Title><Username>barakthemagicnegroe</Username><Timestamp>1345601240000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:07:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With the GOP in power, if your eleven, or twelve year old daughter is the victim of rape , or incest, resulting in pregnancy she will have to carry the zygote to term under the edict of big conservative government..</Msg><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1345635680000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 07:41:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345638362000-16</Id><Topic><Title>While the Media laughed over *Legitimate Rape*</Title><Username>barakthemagicnegroe</Username><Timestamp>1345601240000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:07:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With the GOP harping for a smaller Government they sure are adding many more Government issues with their,,,THEIR ATTACK on WOMEN!!! jmo,gallen and where R all their jobs!</Msg><Username>g_dargusch</Username><Timestamp>1345638362000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 08:26:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345640799000-17</Id><Topic><Title>While the Media laughed over *Legitimate Rape*</Title><Username>barakthemagicnegroe</Username><Timestamp>1345601240000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:07:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>++While there are certainly fringe Republicans who advocate that it is not remotely proposed that Roe v Wade be challenged for real.++ Are you kidding, It is being proposed as a plank in the GOP Convention.....</Msg><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1345640799000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 09:06:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345641239000-18</Id><Title>Ryan Is Akin's Cohort in Anti-Women Agenda</Title><Msg>Ryan’s Record of Abortion Opposition Consistent With Akin’s By Timothy R.

Investors value Apple at 15.4 times trailing 12-month earnings, while the average company in the 2,495-member Nasdaq trades at 16.5 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company rose to a record $665.15 on Aug. 20, giving it a market value of $623.5 billion, the highest-ever for a U.S.- based company. Apple’s profit growth has outpaced its share increase, contributing to the lower price-to-earnings ratio. While the stock has jumped more than 80-fold in the past decade, earnings per share have gained more than 300-fold to $28.05 a share last fiscal year from 9 cents in 2002. Projections for further gains reflect optimism that Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook will use $117.2 billion in cash to keep growing in markets such as mobile devices, while pushing into new ones, including televisions.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345642664000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 09:37:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345643228000-22</Id><Title>Time to Shine: Why Desktop Linux is Taking Over</Title><Msg>Most of the content of this article is embedded in presentation-style graphics.

In letting just anyone use your code, that has to include the bad guys. They're bound to find a way to compromise it, the thinking goes. But that's not the way it works in real life. Having every potential victim working on your neighborhood code watch turns out to deliver more security, not less. Having everyone who might be the victim of an online break-in organized, finding bugs, writing and testing fixes, constantly improving security tools, works. Don't believe me? Well, maybe you'll believe the National Security Agency or the Department of Homeland Security. The open source process works for them, too. For a decade, one of the most popular intrusion prevention and detection systems has been Snort, created by Martin Roesch. But the company he built around that software, Sourcefire, only gives away the basic package. If you need extensions, if you want a more complete system, you have to pay. That code is controlled by Sourcefire. There is nothing unusual in that. Many open-source businesses create free community and paid "enterprise" editions of their software. This is what Red Hat(RHT_) is all about -- you can download Fedora Linux free or buy Red Hat Enterprise Linux. In both cases you get to see the code, but with the paid version you get the support needed to run it professionally. But this model didn't work with Snort. The Department of Homeland Security, the military, and the NSA could not be "held hostage" to Sourcefire for improvements to the code, or for the specialized suite needed to protect the nation. So the Department of Homeland Security got together with major contractors and formed their own open source project, the Open Information Security Foundation. OISF has its own intrusion system, called Suricata, whose syntax is based on Snort, so if you are accustomed to one you can use the other. But Suricata will be a complete system, not just a "sniffer," as intrusion detection products are colloquially known. The whole Suricata suite will be open source. ....</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345645299000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:21:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345645815000-27</Id><Topic><Title>While the Media laughed over *Legitimate Rape*</Title><Username>barakthemagicnegroe</Username><Timestamp>1345601240000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 22:07:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>/if your eleven, or twelve year old daughter is the victim of rape , or incest, resulting in pregnancy/ In the eyes of the GOP, the rape was not legitimate if she got pregnant.

Therefore abortion, even in the case of rape, is forbidden, because you see we have found a way to say it wasn't real rape..

That’s because the starting point for the second dip would be our current weak economy, and this time, policymakers have little room to fix things. Consumers don’t have much fat to cut, either—they did that already—meaning families would have to “cut from the bone.” Other signs round two would be a doozy: Consumer spending hasn’t grown; industrial production is down 8% compared to December 2007; and while the civilian working-age population has grown about 3% since 2007, there are 5% fewer jobs for it. Interest rates can’t go lower than their current zero, and Washington lacks the financial and political means for another stimulus. Finally, “and perhaps most worrisome,” is the fact that the economy is smaller now than it was at the beginning of the recession. The only good news: Corporate profits have hit record highs, and the cash in corporations’ coffers could “act as a buffer to layoffs if demand drops.”</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1345650334000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 11:45:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345650476000-36</Id><Title>Another Historic First for Barack Obama!</Title><Msg>He is our first President to never have a national budget!

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20000822/MSFTLOGO) The County of Santa Clara's principal product is public services, which are provided by more than 15,000 employees across 26 diverse agencies and departments. Among the services are the operation of a public hospital and health system; a 45,000-acre system of urban and mountain parks, trails, lakes, streams and open spaces; tax collection; social services; law and justice operations; roads and airports; and conducting elections. In short, the county could be described as a conglomerate. "Our midmanagers and frontline employees are in a unique position to help the county find workable solutions to challenges," said Jeffrey V. Smith, county executive, who established the Center for Leadership and Transformation (CLT), a strategic in-house program to transform the way the county does business. "By standardizing the way we approach technology and procurement, we will be able to enhance efficiencies throughout the organization and finance them within existing resources." . After a competitive bidding process, the County of Santa Clara selected Microsoft Office 365 and took the opportunity to look across and consolidate IT assets, providing significant cost savings to the county and more than 36 new products. The cost for this expansion was just under 10 percent more than previously spent. The countywide Enterprise Software License Agreement provides the county with significant benefits, such as the following: •Better visibility into its IT assets •Improved mission performance through productivity, unified communications and collaboration tools (Office 365, Microsoft Lync and UC/Collaboration) •Better governance and control over IT spending •The ability to leverage buying power as a large organization "We selected Office 365 because it addressed a wide spectrum of county needs," said Joyce Wing, chief information officer. "The selection of this solution and our IT consolidation efforts have enabled us to nearly double the number of employees covered and will provide our staff with new tools and collaboration technologies to help better serve our residents. Now our staff will be able to move forward collaboratively and take advantage of many new capabilities." "The County of Santa Clara has a long track record as a progressive leader in utilizing new technologies to improve the resident services it provides," said Stuart McKee, chief technology officer for U.S. State and Local Government at Microsoft Corp. "We look forward to a strong continued partnership with Santa Clara to equip and support all its workers with the tools they need to transform their operations, collaborate from virtually anywhere using any device and, ultimately, better serve the public." One of the attractive benefits of Office 365 is the ability to provide a hybrid system that accommodates most county application and security requirements to interact with cloud solutions while providing a local option for highly sensitive communications using advanced security protections.</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1345658375000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 13:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345658547000-49</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>One of the reasons Windows is dominant as the gaming software OS is because it is generally faster than linsux OS</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1345658547000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 14:02:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345658661000-50</Id><Topic><Title>PC Sales Continue Slump</Title><Username>phands.theheretic4</Username><Timestamp>1345647235000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 10:53:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the shape of the box is of little consequence</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1345658661000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 14:04:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345658702000-51</Id><Title>Apple and GOOG dominating.

But returning to Mitt Romney's problem of his own making, perhaps a clue might be Mitt's declaration of his occupation as being "executive", just as his occupation has been for the years after his alleged 2002 "retirement" that he recently backdated to 1999. In fact, Mitt is still a Bain Capital executive receiving his compensation in restricted stock that he launders through his wife's "blind trust". So it's not me who you should get your undies in a bunch over, since it's much more likely that Mitt "let the veil slip" a bit by disclosing that through the year 2010 he was occupied as an executive and gave quite clear indication of the scheme he's used for many years to convert his pay into long term capital gains to cheat the government out of taxes he owes.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345678105000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 19:28:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345678207000-104</Id><Title>Republican Thugs Reputation Tanks</Title><Msg>GOP brand suffers heading into election season There are worrying signs about the Republican brand nationally, just five days before the party gathers for its convention and 76 days before Election Day.

IF Romney is going to win he better start RIGHT NOW pandering to the middle and patting the RWNJ on the head. After all the RWNJ is gonna vote for O???? Screw the RWNJ, if Romney is smart he will know that he can offend them severely and they will STILL vote for him as opposed to a liberal Black man.

By Matt Patterson (columnist - Washington Post, New York Post, San Francisco Examiner) Years from now, historians may regard the 2008 election of Barack Obama as an inscrutable and disturbing phenomenon, the result of a baffling breed of mass hysteria akin perhaps to the witch craze of the Middle Ages. How, they will wonder, did a man so devoid of professional accomplishment beguile so many into thinking he could manage the world's largest economy, direct the world's most powerful military, execute the world's most consequential job? Imagine a future historian examining Obama's pre-presidential life: ushered into and through the Ivy League despite unremarkable grades and test scores along the way; a cushy non-job as a "community organizer"; a brief career as a state legislator devoid of legislative achievement (and in fact nearly devoid of his attention, so often did he vote "present"); and finally an unaccomplished single term in the United States Senate, the entirety of which was devoted to his presidential ambitions. He left no academic legacy in academia, authored no signature legislation as a legislator. And then there is the matter of his troubling associations: the white-hating, America-loathing preacher who for decades served as Obama's "spiritual mentor"; a real-life, actual terrorist who served as Obama's colleague and political sponsor. It is easy to imagine a future historian looking at it all and asking: how on Earth was such a man elected president?</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1345683154000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 20:52:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345683304000-130</Id><Title>WHEN ROMNEY ELECTED BUSINESSES START HIRING.</Title><Msg>Nobody wants to invest with obama in charge.

And 29 percent of registered voters said they had "very negative" impressions of the Republican Party – the second-highest number of voters to give the most intensely negative assessment of the GOP in the history of the NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, dating back to 1990. &lt;&lt;&lt; You reap what you sew.</Msg><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1345685792000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 21:36:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345685961000-135</Id><Topic><Title>K*O*C*H Bros Have Billions For Commercials</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1345679930000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 19:58:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;&gt;Those bassturd billionaires have billions for power plays but not one penny for working people.&lt;&lt; Stop buying Koch Industries' products.

The job must have not paid well because young Ryan moonlighted as a waiter and fitness trainer. No one offered him a "token honor" position at the University of Chicago and a $200,000 dollar a year salary. When a still young Paul Ryan returned to Wisconsin to run for Congress he didn't demonize his opponent and dig up dirt to shovel against him. He waited until the standing Congressman vacated the office before seeking the office. In Janesville , Wisconsin they don't have a big political machine to promote you, to criminalize your opponent; instead Paul Ryan had to go door to door and sit at kitchen tables and listen to his future constituents. After getting elected to Congress Paul Ryan didn't triumphantly march into Washington , buy himself a Georgetown townhouse and proceed over to K Street to rub elbows with lobbyists. He bunked in his Congressional office and used the house gym for showers and a fresh change of clothes. Paul Ryan then married and took his bride back to Janesville . He lives on the same street he lived on as a kid and shares the neighborhood with eight other members of the Ryan clan. He hunts with the local Janesville hunt club and attends PTA meetings and other civic functions. No, I don't know if we can vote for a guy like this. He doesn't have a regal pedigree; he's Irish for God's sake! No one awarded him a Nobel Peace Prize two months after getting elected. No one threw flowers or got "chills up their leg" as a he took his seat in Congress. What is most despicable about Paul Ryan is that he has had the nerve to write the House Budget for three years in a row. He's is brazen and heartless in advocating in that budget for a $5 trillion dollar reduction in federal spending over the next ten years! The House passed his budget three years in a row and three years in a row the Democratically controlled Senate has let it die in the upper house, without ever proposing a budget of their own. What is wrong with this guy? If Congress were to cut $5 trillion dollars from the budget where would the President get the money to give $500 million dollars to a bankrupt Solyndra? Or $200 million dollars for bankrupt Energy 1? Or $11 billion dollars to illegal aliens filing INIT, non-resident tax returns to claim $11 billion big ones in child tax credits, even for their children living in Mexico ? I don't know. Paul Ryan seems heartless to me. He keeps wanting to cut government waste, he keeps wanting to put a halt to those big GSA conventions in Vegas, and worse, he keeps trying to make people look at that $16.7 trillion dollar deficit! The guy's no fun at all!</Msg><Username>free2491</Username><Timestamp>1345686883000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 21:54:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345687198000-144</Id><Topic><Title>K*O*C*H Bros Have Billions For Commercials</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1345679930000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 19:58:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Koch Industries: The Koch brothers' conglomerate is behind a wide range of products including Brawny paper towels, Quilted Northern toilet paper, Dixie paper plates, and Stainmaster carpets along with even less glamorous products like cattle ranches, fertilizer, and asphalt. That's not a flashy or sexy product line, but it makes them a lot of money. That’s why Koch Industries is the largest privately held company in the United States. Libertarians David and Charles Koch also do something that far too few big business owners in this country do. They use their money and influence to help promote the free market principles that allowed them to become so successful in the first place. In addition, they've generously donated more than 600 million dollars to hospitals, theaters, museums, and cancer centers among other worthy causes.
