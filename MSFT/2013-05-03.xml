What's more, hiring in March and February were revised up by a combined 124,000. The increase in hiring in April beat Wall Street's forecast. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch had expected a 135,000 gain, with unemployment remaining at 7.6%. The decline to 7.5% puts the jobless rate at the lowest level since December 2008. Meanwhile, the number of new jobs created in March was revised up to 138,000 from 88,000, the Labor Department said, while February's figure was revised up to 332,000 from 268,000.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367585072501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 08:44:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367585141369-23</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Leaving Office?</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1367335788087</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 11:29:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>plmowrawn leaving the USA??? not for Mexico but for Mogadishu- where he can have lots and lots and lots of guns---------LET IT BE</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367585141369</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 08:45:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367585236034-24</Id><Topic><Title>U.S. economy creates 165,000 jobs in April , beating forecast by 30,000....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367585072501</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 08:44:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Set the foirecast low enough and the beat is easy.

Quite the contrary, in fact. Bill Gates himself has long known that, and he was quite willing to say so publicly, before Microsoft acquired a portfolio of patents. Thus we are closer than ever to a state where public opinion will force a ban on software patents, and perhaps all patents.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367588183460</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:36:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367588328475-43</Id><Topic><Title>Fast Windows 8 adoption continues to bouy Microsoft</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367434878262</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:01:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>35$ today???????????????????? tough titty bashers!!!!!

Its specifications are in line with mid-range WP8 devices. Some time back it was rumored that Huawei was working on another device that would run on the same platform, yet it was going to be a high-end device, matching specifications of some of the top Windows Phone 8 smartphones. Now the Huawei Ascend W2 specs have allegedly leaked, leading us to believe that the company indeed has a second WP8 smartphone. ascend-w2 The leaked Huawei Ascend W2 specs point at a 1.5Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor with 1GB of RAM, an 8 megapixel rear camera with LED flash and 1080p HD video recording, a 4.3-inch 720p HD IPS touchscreen display, Bluetooth, GPS, HSPA+, Wi-Fi and a 2000 mAh battery pack. These leaked Ascend W2 specs fail to mention the internal storage of the device and if there’s an option for external storage via microSD cards. The source of this rumor claims that the release date of Ascend W2 was November 15, 2012. This is ambiguous, as the date has already passed and still the company has not officially announced the device. Apart from these Ascend W2 specs, the rumor also mentions a price point of $289, which is reasonable considering the hardware specifications of this smartphone. Ads by Google Huawei confirmed last month that they would be releasing a new smartphone in Summer, though they didn’t mention whether that is going to be based on Android or Windows Phone 8. As of now, the Ascend W1 is its only offering on Microsoft’s mobile platform, which is largely dominated by the Nokia Lumia series. via Intomobile</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1367588935708</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 09:48:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367588999566-45</Id><Title>Check out These Stock Picks</Title><Msg>Best stock tips there are.

U.S. Stock Market Is ‘Overvalued, Overbought and Overbullish’: John Hussman We enter earnings season with the Dow (DJI) and S&amp;P 500 (^GSPC) having recently passed their all-time highs. One of the narratives for why the markets keep rising (aside from the Fed’s easy money policies and optimism about a U.S. economic recovery) is strength in corporate profits and earnings. Meanwhile, there are warnings coming from some commentators of a bubble in stocks or a bubble in bonds, or a bubble in certain areas of the credit market. Fund manager John Hussman wrote in a recent weekly market commentary, "the real hook, in my view, is the absence of a bubble in any individual sector, and instead a bubble in profit margins across the entire corporate sector.” According to Hussman, corporate profits are near 11% of GDP and 70% above the historical norm. (Hussman agrees with Warren Buffett that one has to be wildly optimistic to believe corporate profits -- as a percent of GDP -- can hold above 6% for a sustained period.) gl.

All these things and more we love about our President. Unfortunately you are unable to comprehend the many true reasons the People love President Obama.

April 2013 Employment Data Affected by Seasonal Changes Yes, on a seasonally adjusted basis the Table A-1, U/E rate is 7.5%, down by 0.1%, which looks like an improvement. Most of the stats are essentially unchanged and there is nothing in Table A-1 to explain what is going on. On Table B-1 we find, on a NOT seasonally adjusted basis, that (preliminary) Total Private Employment has increased by 937000 in the following industries (highest to low) Leisure and hospitality: +323000 (preliminary) (Its Spring Time!) Professional and business services: +240000 (preliminary) (Tax accountants in April?) Construction: +160000 (preliminary) (Its Spring Time!) Retail trade: +107000 (preliminary) Its Spring Time!) Those four account for 740000 of the change. There are about another 107000 scattered elsewhere. So the tiny (0.1 point) blip in unemployment can be explained as seasonal variations in the underlying data, remaining even after being adjusted for seasonal variations. For those of you who like the data: (numbers in thousands) (Comparison is April-2013 to March-2013) APRIL-2013 Table A-1 (Household data) Adjusted: Labor Participation Rate: 63.3 (unchanged) Total Employed: 143579 (up by 293) Employment Population Ratio: 58.6 (up 0.1) Unemployed: 11659 (down 83) Unemployment Rate: 7.5 (down by 0.1) Not in Labor Force: 89936 (down by 31) But want a job: 6413 (down by 309) From Table B-1 (Data by Industry Sector) Unadjusted (Includes seasonal): Total private: +937 (preliminary) Leisure and hospitality: +323 (preliminary) Professional and business services: +240 (preliminary) Construction: +160 (preliminary) Retail trade: +107 (preliminary)</Msg><Username>lord_snivel_drivel_project</Username><Timestamp>1367610250557</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 15:44:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367610302535-155</Id><Title>Record DOW and S&amp;P, Thanks Obama!

If Obama were white, black people would have voted for him very close to the same, being largely democrat and for the litte guy, and a lot more whites would have voted for him too.

Are there racist whites who don't like him for skin color? I'm sure there are, just thinking logically. With Obama taking 93%+ of the black vote from Hillary, that is statistically racist, not speculation. Asking for his records is quite fair. I strongly suspect he received aid as a foreign student, *OR* was subsidized by the likes of Bill Ayers who was grooming him to destroy the economic system here through intent or ignorance.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367619475243</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:17:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367619859340-182</Id><Title>Microsoft Says Windows Phone 8 App Downloads Have Doubled And Revenue Up 140% (Source Forbes)</Title><Msg>On Friday Microsoft announced that since Windows Phone 8′s, the company has seen the number of App downloads double and almost a 140% increase in paid app revenue. This is, of course, great news for App developers, and a strong indicator that Windows Phone 8 is doing well. In fact, in a blog post Microsoft notes that “The industry continues to recognize Windows Phone steady growth. According to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, Windows Phone has already increased its share of all smartphone sales by nearly 2% compared to last year and is attracting "first-time smartphone buyers.” It’s noteworthy that Microsoft has been able to saturate the market as much as it has, and continues to provide consumers even more options. Microsoft also points out in its blog post that that the Nokia ’s Lumia 720 and 520/521 phones “have just begun to ship across the globe, giving potential Windows Phone customers additional choices in form factor, phone capabilities, and price points.”</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367619859340</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:24:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367621606533-183</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Says Windows Phone 8 App Downloads Have Doubled And Revenue Up 140% (Source Forbes)</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367619859340</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:24:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Microsoft announced...." = lies.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1367621606533</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:53:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367622194155-184</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Says Windows Phone 8 App Downloads Have Doubled And Revenue Up 140% (Source Forbes)</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367619859340</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 18:24:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Quoting what you left out (lying by telling half the truth): "...Windows Phone 8 is doing well (though notably still not nearly as well as Android or iOS.)".

"I wouldn't be surprised if they do streamline and do drop [Windows RT]," said Brian Proffitt, an adjunct instructor of management at Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business , in an interview. "Microsoft is going to remain heavily invested in its Surface tablet strategy, but that doesn't preclude them from making changes and cutting. Cutting Windows RT would be a smart move, unless the number of shipments suddenly improves." Jack Gold, an analyst at J. Gold Associates, was more blunt: "I believe Microsoft would be much better off killing RT and going with one unified tablet OS [with Windows 8]. The need to support ARM [processors] was why Microsoft went with RT. But it never really worked that well." IDC said Wednesday that just 200,000 tablets running Windows RT, including Microsoft's own Surface RT, shipped in the first quarter, which was 0.4% of the total market of 49.2 million tablets. Windows RT tablets first started shipping late last October, although Samsung early on decided not to ship a Windows RT tablet in the U.S. -----------------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1367626273757</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 20:11:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367626282327-194</Id><Title>Wrong time to short MSFT.

Investors cheered the jobs report on Friday, which showed employment rose at a faster than anticipated pace an April and hiring in the prior two months was much stronger than previously thought. With little in the way of economic data on tap next week and earnings season moving into the home stretch, there appears to be little that could derail a move higher. "That's the $64,000 question - without a micro or macro focus, what do we shift our attention to?" said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York. "I would argue in a lack of critical information this market has found a path of least resistance to the upside." Corporate earnings have improved from earlier market expectations, with the expected earnings growth now at 5.2 percent, up from 1.5 percent at the start of earnings season.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367631862776</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 21:44:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367632018792-204</Id><Title>Right winger sends email about Muslim stamp to me</Title><Msg>Says Obama directed the postal Service to issue the new stamp.

The researchers developed DroidChameleon, a tool that can modify known malware apps in numerous ways to prevent them from being detected. Most of the ten scanners they tested mainly performed signature-based analyses. In some cases, simply changing the package name in the metadata was enough for virus scanners to consider the malware harmless. Several scanners could be fooled by unpacking the malware and then creating new installation packages. In other cases, the researchers were successful after encrypting parts of the app or redirecting function calls. Their conclusion is unambiguous: all ten anti-virus programs could be fooled in one way or another. Tested scanners included anti-virus programs from AVG, Dr. Web, ESET, ESTSoft, Kaspersky, Lookout, Symantec, Trend Micro, Webroot and Zoner.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367633671515</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-03 22:14:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367634656860-209</Id><Title>Gun owners will need to "Stand their Ground" because the radical left is focused</Title><Msg>on passing laws that do nothing to alter criminal ownership of guns but take them from honest citizens.

Windows 8 developers wonder, where's the ad revenue? All through the month of April, ad-supported Windows 8 apps have gotten next to no ads. That means no revenue for developers. What gives? April 29, 2013, 3:28 PM — Microsoft has long supported its developer community, but even there it can stumble on occasion. Developers of ad-supported apps for Windows 8 have been left high and dry for the month of April with no in-app advertising. Starting on March 31, ads provided to ad-supported Windows 8 apps have been almost completely absent. The ads come from pubCenter, which provides ads to Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 applications. For the most part, Microsoft was the primary buyer of the ads, so developers could at least count on Bing ads to show up. Since 3/31, however, even the Bing ads stopped and now ad-driven apps aren't getting a thing. So apps will get millions of impressions (translation: users) that are not being converted into income, and developers are upset, to say the least. In two separate community threads (1, 2) on the Bing support boards, developers have repeatedly demanded an answer from Microsoft, with only one mid-level Microsoft staffer catching the spears but having no answers. "I used to have a good bit of impressions / day then it dropped to barely nothing last week and now we're essentially at zero. I do only free apps so this is killing me! How am I even supposed to cover my Windows Azure costs let alone all the labor invested!" wrote user "silverdollar." "This is pathetic. I've been defending windows 8 since the day it came out. I would think that microsoft would want to build up the ecosystem by at least PAYING their developers. It looks like I may have backed the wrong horse," wrote user "javalsu." "I published a new game 4 days ago, and so far it has generated 0.01 EUR, even it already has a lot of downloads.
