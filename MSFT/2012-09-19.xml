People really are forgetful about history. -- -- Following Joseph Smith's martyrdom, Brigham Young introduced an oath in the endowment which required members to swear vengeance "upon this nation." It became the subject of a United States Senate Investigation. Reed Smoot was a Mormon Apostle who had been elected a Senator from Utah. In 1903 a protest was filed in the United States Senate to have Hon. Smoot removed from office, on the grounds that he had taken this treasonous oath in the endowment ritual. The complete record of this episode was published in: U.S. Senate Document 486 (59th Congress, 1st Session) Proceedings Before the Committee on Privileges and Elections of the United States Senate in the Matter of the Protests Against the Right of Hon. Reed Smoot, a Senator from the State of Utah, to hold his Seat. 4 vols.[+1 vol. index] (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1906) Several former Mormons revealed the content of this oath. The wording was as follows: "You and each of you do covenant and promise that you will pray and never cease to pray to Almighty God to avenge the blood of the prophets upon this nation, and that you will teach the same to your children and to your children's children unto the third and fourth generation."</Msg><Username>zoso925</Username><Timestamp>1348036560629</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 02:36:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348038096722-2</Id><Topic><Title>How many lies is Obama going to get away with.

The failed former half-term absentee Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (which is, of course, located in the heart of Socialist Europe), however, is a strange and novel animal for the mob of slack-jawed bigots and more-ons comprising the rump Confederacy reincarnated as the Republican "base". It's certain that they'll be quite enthused with Mitt's full-throated declaration of war on Americans, they've been re-enacting this scenario lovingly for many decades and hoping for the re-incarnation of Jefferson Davis to lead them to their long delayed victory. Unfortunately, the actual Republican party might view this re-declaration of the Civil War a bit off-putting. There are a few G.A.R. halls southwest of Mitt's digs near "Golden Pond" that would be more inclined to an older-fashioned welcome than the neo-Gingrich turn of Mitt's campaign. Glad you've finally acknowledged Obama as your Lord and Savior, by the way.

Looks like 8 is #$%$ as all windoze versions</Title><Msg>wwwDOTtheregisterDOTcoDOTuk/2012/09/19/win8_rootkit/ Windoze 8 carrying on the tradition of no security at all... Security researchers have discovered security shortcomings in Windows 8 that create a means to infect the upcoming operating system with rootkit-style malware. Italian security consultants ITSEC discovered the security hole following an analysis of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), a successor to the legacy BIOS firmware interface, that Microsoft began fully supporting with 64-bit versions of Windows 7. ITSEC analysed the UEFI platform now that Microsoft has ported old BIOS and MBR's boot loader to the new UEFI technology in Windows 8. Andrea Allievi, a senior security researcher at ITSEC, was able to use the research to cook up what's billed as the first ever UEFI bootkit designed to hit Windows 8. The proof-of-concept malware is able to defeat Windows 8's Kernel Patch Protection and Driver Signature Enforcement policy. The UEFI boot loader developed by Allievi overwrites the legitimate Windows 8 UEFI bootloader, bypassing security defences in the process. "Our bootloader hooked the UEFI disk I/O routines and it intercepted the loading of the Windows 8 kernel, thus our bootkit tampered the kernel by disabling the security features used by Windows to prevent the loading of unsigned drivers," explains Marco Giuliani, a director of ITSEC. The bootkit developed by ITSEC is comparable to forms of older MBR (Master Boot Record) rootkits that overwrite system files of older version of Windows. Bootkits capable of taking over Windows 8 machines have been around since last November but these earlier proof-of-concept nasties didn't circumvent UEFI, unlike the latest research. Previously boot loaders and rootkits had to be developed in assembly language. But UEFI creates a means to develop system loaders much more straightforwardly using the easier C programming language, making thing easier for both legitimate developers and VXers.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348068061755</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 11:21:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348071630859-26</Id><Title>Win8 tablets may cost MORE than iPads – AND LAPTOPS</Title><Msg>wwwDOTtheregisterDOTcoDOTuk/2012/09/18/windows_tablet_sticker_shock/ No one is ever going to buy a windoze based tablet, even if it was free....never mind these prices....... Microsoft has predicted that Windows 8 and Windows RT will usher in a new era of touch-based computing, but if leaked pricing from Asus is anything to go by, customers will have to pay a pretty penny to share in Redmond's vision. Although PC makers have been busy readying a range of tablets and laptops with touchscreens in advance of the Windows 8 launch, most have been tight-lipped about pricing. But a slide from an Asus presentation leaked to ZDNet indicates that its upcoming Windows tablets may cost more than most current laptops – and in some cases, much more. The slide shows three tablet models: two designed for full Windows 8 and one that runs Windows RT, Microsoft's more limited version of the OS for devices with ARM processors. The Windows RT model is called the Vivo Tab RT (TF600T). From a press release issued in August, we knew that it's based on a quad-core Tegra 3 processor, has a 10.1-inch Super IPS+ display at 1366x768 resolution, and ships with 2GB RAM and 32GB storage. What we didn't know is that those specs will cost $599. That's sure to be a tough sale. The buy-in for Apple's most recent iPad is just $499, and older models go for even less. It seems doubtful that many customers would be willing to pay more for a device running a brand-new Microsoft platform when they could go with the product that has already captured nearly 70 per cent of the market.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348071630859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:20:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348072472096-27</Id><Title>What is up with this pig?</Title><Msg>Market rallying and this thing is standing still?

The Windows RT model is called the Vivo Tab RT (TF600T). From a press release issued in August, we knew that it's based on a quad-core Tegra 3 processor, has a 10.1-inch Super IPS+ display at 1366x768 resolution, and ships with 2GB RAM and 32GB storage. What we didn't know is that those specs will cost $599. That's sure to be a tough sale. The buy-in for Apple's most recent iPad is just $499, and older models go for even less. It seems doubtful that many customers would be willing to pay more for a device running a brand-new Microsoft platform when they could go with the product that has already captured nearly 70 per cent of the market."" Since Microsoft considers themselves to be a software company who needs to prod its hardware partners into being competitive with Microsofts own hardware- then to keep the partners in the game Microsoft laptops tablets and phones will tend to be a little high and will offer an umbrella of sorts to these partners- all pretty simple but the board simpleton (phands) couldnt fathom something in the slightest bit complicated.</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1348076910610</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 13:48:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348078118142-33</Id><Topic><Title>Win8 tablets may NOT cost MORE than iPads - LAPTOPS</Title><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1348076910610</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 13:48:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wally....you're a #$%$</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348078118142</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:08:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348078173217-34</Id><Topic><Title>Win8 tablets may cost MORE than iPads – AND LAPTOPS</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348071630859</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 12:20:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump.....wally's a #$%$</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348078173217</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:09:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348078225894-35</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bump again....</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348078225894</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 14:10:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348078802851-36</Id><Title>"Redistribution" means Romney pays a 20% tax rate</Title><Msg>and Obama pays(like he already does) a 20% tax rate, as an example.

You do not want to short Microsoft, then I realize the volume of transaction was decrease from over 40M to 28M. Everyone is happy with the increased dividend and do not want to sell.

Now with the Windows Phone, Bill can under beat iPHONE with business apps and freebie on skype, office etc. THe eco system is ready, every reseller will embrace it for better profit margin than iPHONE! Just watch the repeated feat of Microsoft to beat once leaders in Word stars, os/2, Netendo, it is a hugh market for SURFACE !</Msg><Username>topinvestgun1</Username><Timestamp>1348111072499</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 23:17:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348111185717-113</Id><Topic><Title>Obama "Redistribution" is Communism 101</Title><Username>paulrand18</Username><Timestamp>1348108629301</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 22:37:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Closet?</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1348111185717</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 23:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348111213920-114</Id><Topic><Title>The Fed Had To Act Because The Norquist Controlled Congress Won't Pass Bowles Simpson</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1348092842202</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 18:14:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GFY saa hole.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1348111213920</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 23:20:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
