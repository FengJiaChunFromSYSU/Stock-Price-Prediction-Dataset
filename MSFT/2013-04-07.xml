Where was the big pat on the back in the 1970's and 1980's when million of baby boomers came of work age and paid billions of dollars INTO the system? Where was the thank you? NOW, all you read about or hear about is the millins of baby boomers about to retire and the drag that will create on the system. Baby boomers listen up, take at least your dividends out of your IRA's or 401K's on a quarterly basis, pay the current marginal tax rate on the withdrawals. I'm telling you here and now, the chances the marginal tax rates will go up at least 10% by the time you retire, is 100%. PLUS, how do you know, there won't be an ASSET TAX, or reduced benefits because you have a small nest egg. It's best to hide what you have, by taking it Off Paper Statements, and sticking the cash under your mattress. Not all of it, but some at least.</Msg><Username>will.needy</Username><Timestamp>1365336580875</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 08:09:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365337585866-10</Id><Topic><Title>Why babyboomers SS &amp; Medicare should be ended</Title><Username>marcopubio</Username><Timestamp>1365308356569</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 00:19:16 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wait a minute. Obama ended the wars right? When he came into office in 08, the nation was 9 trillion in debt. So let's see. Now we are 17 trillion in debt. Wars caused this increase? Anybody with dividend income in an IRA or 401K, why (1) are you reinvesting those dividends at 52 week highs and (2) why are you letting them just go back into an account that could be taxed at higher marginal rates down the road. I can see the day in not to distant future, where "tax the rich" means even if you have $100,000 in a retirement account, not just INCOME, but ASSETS! It's called Means Testing.

Now, figure with conservative dividends, you can make 4% per year on that $200,000 or 8,000 a year. Withdraw the $8,000 a year divi plus 1/20 of the $200,000 principal or total of about $18,000 a year to do what you want with. Trips, cars, whatever. Enjoy it. Then when you are 85, you will have nothing left as an investment, but your house or car or anything you purchased with your withdrawals. You'll still get Social Security to live on.

The problem is that, any investment advisor will tell you, past performance is no guarantee of future performance. The current hoo-ha is about projections of future performance. Further, the author says little to nothing about recent deviations from long-term past performance, except to blame them on recent economic woes. But as everyone knows, even after taking those woes into account, Microsoft has been faltering, and PC sales have been levelling off and even falling. So, despite this author's protestations, there is good reason to believe Microsoft is in deep trouble.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1365374125040</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-07 18:35:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365377827807-48</Id><Title>Wayne LaPierre's Job Is To .....</Title><Msg>Wayne LaPierre's job is to draw the attention to himself and away from the gun manufacturers.

More than Windows, Office, Xbox, Bing, Windows Phone, and every other product that Microsoft has created since 1975.
