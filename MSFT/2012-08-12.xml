Ryan’s plan gets more aggressive. Under Ryan’s 2011 budget plan, the CBO projected in 2011 that deficits would be 2 percent of GDP by 2022, compared to 2.75 percent under current law, and compared to 9 percent in 2010. PEOPLE WILL HAVE TO PAY MORE A big part of Ryan’s method for slowing the rapid growth of health-care costs is by shifting incentives. Under his plan, it’s in the best interest of Medicare beneficiaries and health insurers to pay less for health care, avoiding superfluous services and procedures. Under the current system, that incentive doesn’t exist, as the government foots some of the bills. That said, the Congressional Budget Office projected in 2011 that individuals would have to pay more under his plan, with their share of (albeit lower) costs skyrocketing to 61 percent by 2022. The CBO’s preliminary long-term analysis included this chart of findings that drove much of the discussion of Ryan’s plan in 2011:</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1344788713000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:25:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344790325000-15</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your "facts" arent facts- they are lies and you are a liar</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1344790325000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:52:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344790383000-16</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey crybaby see your mother- she needs to change you</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1344790383000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:53:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344790627000-17</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;&gt;Yes, since it runs on the fastest computers ever made, the fastest machines on the planet, and was picked for that reason, then Linux is the fastest OS.&gt;&gt; go ahead stake your life on it- you stand a good chance of losing- especially if Microsoft is allowed to tune a version of Windows 7 or Server In the meantime you remain the crybaby of the board backing the sacred icon of the loser segment of the IT community who couldnt make it with Microsoft because they just dont have it</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1344790627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 12:57:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344791103000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Some of the skank aliases on IGNORE</Title><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1344725529000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-11 18:52:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bump.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1344791103000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 13:05:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344791340000-19</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;Just one more example of how P.U. proves himself wrong time after time.&lt; LIAR.!

(EA), the second- largest U.S. video-game maker, is in talks with Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to bring mobile games to the next version of Windows as it sees the platform as “important” to its handset strategy. “We’re working very closely with Microsoft to understand what their views on gaming navigation are,” Chief Operating Officer Peter Moore said in a phone interview. “Anything that allows more platforms to be adopted quickly that have a gaming element is good for Electronic Arts.” The Redwood City, California-based company is counting on games on phones and tablet computers as well as Internet-based games as it tries to reduce reliance on boxed retail products. The mobile version of Windows 8, due later this year, is also central to Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)’s plan to revive smartphone sales amid competition from Apple Inc.’s iPhone and devices running Google Inc.’s Android software. Nokia plans to announce its new line of smartphones using the Windows Phone 8 operating system as early as next month and offer them for sale before the year-end holiday shopping season, a person with knowledge of the matter said this month. Moore was speaking before the annual Gamescom conference in Cologne, Germany, next week, where Electronic Arts will show a new version of city-building simulator “SimCity” as well as updates to its “FIFA Soccer,” “Medal of Honor” and “‘Need for Speed’’ titles. He said the company is on the lookout for more acquisitions after purchasing game makers including PopCap Games Inc. and Playfish Inc. ‘‘We’re in a very strong position with our balance sheet and we’re never afraid to use it if the opportunity arises,” Moore said. “We’re always looking at opportunities for us to strengthen our development capabilities, maybe our IP and maybe our technology backbone” including middleware and network technology.</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1344798972000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 15:16:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344808647000-24</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Linux has that big 1.5% market share.
