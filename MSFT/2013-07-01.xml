I actually hate your analogy because I think it insensitive to the Martin family considering current events, but yes there is a comparison. The parallels: You attack but are not prepared for your adversary, you think you have an advantage, you tell me I've had it, then, without added warning, you're, (ahem) "gone" each and every time, you are done in by your youth inexperience, overestimation of your own prowess and underestimation of the opponent. The difference is that you have an opportunity to learn from your losses but are obviously too dense to grasp your situation.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1372672336571</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 05:52:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1372674351858-3</Id><Title>I told you so, futures were red, U.S. / European trade in shambles due to Obama spying, the futures</Title><Msg>pump began.

Quoting: "On Wednesday, Hewlett-Packard and Google debuted an IT solution for small- and medium-size businesses that are looking to eliminate complexity and cut costs. The new offering bundles HP's PC hardware with Google's Google Apps services. "It's so simple, the companies said, that HP is calling it "HP SMB IT in a Box," combining PCs and printers with the Google Apps suite of productivity services. It's all tied up with a thin layer of HP management software, designed to virtually eliminate oversight, and help keep setup to a minimum. The new program will roll out in July via HP's reseller network, HP said. "HP announced the new program as part of its Discover conference in Las Vegas, aimed at businesses from SMBs up through the enterprise. "What this venture is designed to do," said HP chief executive Meg Whitman, "is to help simplify the customer's IT environment," for those small-to-medium sized businesses that adopt Google Apps, Computerworld reported."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1372682575891</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 08:42:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372683036354-16</Id><Topic><Title>hawcreek law allows starting a fight with a black man then shooting him if you are losing.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1372623957339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-30 16:25:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"My debunking you is like pounding your head into concrete ...

When it's personal it's almost impossible to be dispassionate and fair. I don't blame Trayvon's parents for failing to see their own or Trayvon's possible contribution to the outcome. "...and the act not so lawful.. " The act may or may not have been unlawful, that's the reason we seat a jury not personally involved emotionally. So far there has been absolutely no evidence presented to dispute Zimmerman's account that it was lawful. Our system is set up to let some guilty walk if he were by forcing guilt to be proven. You playing the race card is idiotic, if the racial roles were reversed I would have the same position. A black man in Florida killed a white man in front of the white man's daughter because the white man defended some skate boarders and no charges were filed until charges were filed against Zimmerman and the "double standard" created an outcry, then it was manslaughter on a much clearer murder case with witnesses and evidence. Yes the double standard can be quite telling for you racists who remained silent on that case.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1372688800386</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 10:26:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372688935012-30</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts: All the noise about the Fed is over....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1372378746839</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-27 20:19:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"WE are moving up on fundamentals you dumb S0B."

You think people with pre-existing conditions should just suffer? When someone has to go to another plan, with pre-existing conditions, they should be disallowed from health care? You want insurance companies to decide people's fate? Really? The law is on the books, and it's very good. I's not wealth redistribution, it's smarter health care and saves everyone money.

The latest diesel engines are at least as fuel-efficient as the hybrids are these days, so the savings in fuel is no longer a chief selling point for new hybrids.

The Obama family trip to Africa has largely been ignored by the U.S. media, and for good reason: it seems to have no real purpose. While attention to Africa is long overdue, the president is announcing no new strategy, concluding no significant agreements. Much of his trip to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania consists of sightseeing with his family, and an entourage of 1,000 people, at a cost to American taxpayers of $60 to $100 million. Consider the reason Obama gave reporters about why he is visiting Cape Town on Sunday: His schedule on Sunday begins with a flight to Cape Town and then a helicopter ride to the museum on Robben Island. Obama visited when he was a senator but this time is bringing his family. He said he's eager to teach them about Mandela's role in overcoming white racist rule, first as an activist and later as a president who forged a unity government with his former captors. He told reporters on Saturday he wants to "help them to understand not only how those lessons apply to their own lives but also to their responsibilities in the future as citizens of the world, that's a great privilege and a great honour". So a significant part of the trip is devoted to the education of Obama's own family. Could such a trip not have waited until after his term in office, or been taken at the Obamas' own expense, without the trade delegations, diplomats, advance teams and valets--to say nothing of the cost to local law enforcement in South Africa? The only newsworthy aspect of Obama's visit has been the revelation that the new U.S. ambassador to South Africa will be White House Political Director Patrick Gaspard -- a long-time left-wing activist notable for having served on the board of the Working Families Party, a far-left organization associated with ACORN.

Answer: Fake working vacations ... "In response to growing criticism that the president was on vacation too much, the Bush administration adopted the Rovian tactic of scheduling, “work events,” while the president was in Crawford so that they could claim that President Bush’s vacations were working vacations." Also "The problem is that W. wasn’t thrifty. He was the most expensive vacation president in US history. Not only did Bush spend more days on vacation than any other president, but he used Air Force One more often while on vacation than any other president." "President Bush took 149 trips to Camp David, 77 visits to his Crawford ranch, and 11 trips to his father's Kennebunkport mansion. Since Air Force One reportedly cost $56,800 per hour to operate in 2004 (which Bush used to get to Crawford), and the plane can travel up to 630 miles per hour, it cost at least $259,657 to get the 2,880 miles to Crawford and back, each time Bush went"</Msg><Username>hawcreeks_world</Username><Timestamp>1372712683080</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 17:04:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1372712728464-87</Id><Topic><Title>What are the Obama's Doing in Africa?</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1372697032582</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-01 12:43:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They must be on a diplomatic mission.

Not so in this case as this company is one of the most disorganized, dysfunctional companies I've ever seen. They were just fortunate to have a product that people wanted and not much more. They always talk about restructuring, reorganizing , etc., and Wall Street falls for it, not asking the right questions, runs up the stock a bit, and then leaves it for dead after being surprised by the fact that the more things are said will change, the more they stay the same. MSFT has the uncanny knack of dumping the good workers and hanging onto the knuckleheads who can't do the work, and then having to hire back the good ones as independent contractors. Makes no sense and is no way to run a company. On top of that the leader of the company is more concerned about Seattle having a pro basketball team than he is minding the store for stockholders.
