Nobody sacrifices directly, the compliance is easy to measure, the effect is certain to fix the problem. If we all (countries) commit to population reduction targets ( from reduced births) then our civilization has a chance. It is also soooooo easy to implement, just more of the same that we have been doing all along, birth control, planned parenthood, subsidies for contraceptives, and even tax breaks for families that comply.&gt; All claptrap, and all totally unnecessary. We already know what works: simply educate women, and they solve the problem. That doesn't mean indoctrinating them about birth control, it means really *educating* them. It works every time. In some parts of the world, population is already decreasing because the birth rate is below self-replacement. Last I checked, that was true of eastern Europe, Russia, and by one report even central Europe.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345042227000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 10:50:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345042376000-22</Id><Topic><Title>The only real solution to MMGW</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1344990420000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 20:27:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>""Do you actually think people living in North America did not move and adjust for this?""

Divert to Obama doesn't take away from the fact Ryan has a BA and he is writing budgets way over his qualifications to do so.

This is where the Open Source movement can have the most positive effect. Tesla's Model S relies on Linux Linux, For Serious Systems. Linux, and other Unix systems power the world of the Internet. Routers, data centers mostly operate using either operating systems, OS. Since they were written with robustness in mind and with a kernel, the brain of the OS is removed from direct contact with other sub-systems. So is it any wonder that Tesla Motors chose Linux to power, or should we say manage its Model S? Linux And The Model S. In a recent interview on PCWorld, Tesla Motors’ CTO, JB Straubel talks about the operating system’s role within the Model S. Sporting a gorgeous 17 “ display panel, the Model S also uses serious graphic muscles to power this display with no less than 2 NVIDIA GeForce GPU Tegra processors. See our Tesla Model S Promises Unsurpassed Visual User Experience, for more information. Tesla is seriously pushing how an electric car should feel and behave like. With usability, technology and infotainment in mind, these features were key design points from the very beginning. Batteries are still at the top of the list as far as the technical area that takes center stage for electric cars. Next is software and management, which is obviously very critical. Software management gives an electric car its smooth feel, fast accelerator pedal response and longer battery range. High torque is managed by the controller, which is also itself managed by software. Most of the software in the Model S was written by Tesla Motors. That means all screens and displays inside the electric car are using a version of Linux that is open source. Since it is very robust and standard, it is perfect for the display and entertainment within the Model S. Tesla can save money and tweak the software to work exactly and specifically for what it needs to do. The controller and other more mechanical components don't use operating systems, per se but a lower level language, usually C also written in-house. Tesla Motors, as other electric carmakers are finding the open source movement provides much freedom at a very affordable price to intelligently manage their electric cars. With engineers writing and programming the rest in the C programming language, they can actually build everything from scratch and adapt as needed. As we move into the future, more and more open source software will find its way into electric cars. Yes, it requires a lot of programming and tweaking at first, but once it is set, nothing much needs to happen, save for the few occasional updates and upgrades. Linux and Unix will play a vital role in the future of electric cars and Tesla Motors’ use of Linux in their Model S is a perfect example of that.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345044259000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:24:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345044338000-39</Id><Topic><Title>Why Does Obama have the DHS and Now the Weather Service....</Title><Username>general_squalor</Username><Timestamp>1345042337000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 10:52:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What Obama REALLY wants is a Secret State Police.

He developed a US Budget which passed in the House of Representatives and got 41 votes in the US Senate, but not enough to pass. The voting in both houses largely followed party lines. Barack Obama (D), the President of the United State, attended Occidental College in California, Columbia University in NYC and graduated from Harvard Law School, 'magna cum laude'. He developed a US Budget that got ZERO (0) votes in the House and Zero (0) votes in the Senate. Obama did not even convince Democrats in his own party to vote for his budget! President Zero got a ZERO (0)! Now some dingbat on this message board is complaining that Paul Ryan doesn't have sufficient college credentials to develop a US Budget. But lets compare further: Nancy Pelosi (D), First woman Speaker of the House (2007-2011), current House Minority Leader, graduated from Trinity College in Washington, DC with a degree in poly sci. As Speaker of the House it was her duty to produce a budget, which she failed to do for over three years. Harry Reid (D), current Senate Majority Leader, got double degrees in poly-sci and history at Utah State University and later a JD degree from George Washington U. Law School. He has actively participated in making any budget impossible for over three years. It looks to me like the (R) is a lot more important in making a budget and the (D) being a guaranteed failure!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1345050855000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:14:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345051270000-56</Id><Topic><Title>Time to turn</Title><Username>norine_lakeisha54</Username><Timestamp>1345042301000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 10:51:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Its Useful</Msg><Username>sibyl_chrystal47</Username><Timestamp>1345051270000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:21:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345051295000-57</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan has a BA from some college</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1345000173000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:09:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I never got once from Obama that he thinks he is smarter than everyone else, [You obviously were not listening very well!] Obama is smart and has the hard work and education behind him, it shows in his thought.

Paul Ryan (R), a congressman from Wisconsin, earned a BA degree (in poli-sci?) from Miami University in Ohio. He developed a US Budget which passed in the House of Representatives and got 41 votes in the US Senate, but not enough to pass. The voting in both houses largely followed party lines. Barack Obama (D), the President of the United State, attended Occidental College in California, Columbia University in NYC and graduated from Harvard Law School, 'magna cum laude'. He developed a US Budget that got ZERO (0) votes in the House and Zero (0) votes in the Senate. Obama did not even convince Democrats in his own party to vote for his budget! President Zero got a ZERO (0)! Now some dingbat on this message board is complaining that Paul Ryan doesn't have sufficient college credentials to develop a US Budget. But lets compare further: Nancy Pelosi (D), First woman Speaker of the House (2007-2011), current House Minority Leader, graduated from Trinity College in Washington, DC with a degree in poly sci. As Speaker of the House it was her duty to produce a budget, which she failed to do for over three years. Harry Reid (D), current Senate Majority Leader, got double degrees in poly-sci and history at Utah State University and later a JD degree from George Washington U. Law School. He has actively participated in making any budget impossible for over three years. It looks to me like the (R) is a lot more important in making a budget and the (D) being a guaranteed failure!</Msg><Username>balongnieponey</Username><Timestamp>1345052851000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:47:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345053098000-70</Id><Topic><Title>FORBES:Obama SMALLEST GOV.

Nowadays the field is dominated by professional criminals motivated by monetary gain. &lt;Maybe just to mess around with the owners head. You start your car and the dashboard says, "I HACKED YOU CAR, FOOL!" Or erases the O/S or some other 'fun' thing. (Change the brake &amp; accelerator controls.)&gt; First, you're right that it would almost certainly be someone other than the owner doing the cracking. Anyone with enough on the ball to afford at $70K car would not likely muck about with it just for laughs, at the risk of disabling it and grounding himself. If he enjoyed mucking about with software, he would most likely exercise that penchant on a box in his den or basement. Someone other than the owner would have to physically break into the car (risking an encounter with the police) or access it by radio through standard protocols, in which case he would be trying to crack the protocols, not the operating system, and he would be no better off, and probably worse off, than if the computer was running, say, Windows. &lt;But also crack: If I can crack the code maybe I can steal the car without damaging it...much.&gt; Cracking the electronic door and ignition lock would be simpler.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345053973000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 14:06:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345054202000-77</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan has a BA from some college</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1345000173000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:09:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I am serious about this.

Under Department of Health targets, hospitals should admit or discharge 95 per cent of A&amp;E patients within four hours. But in the worst-performing trust – Surrey and Sussex Healthcare – more than one in five had to wait more than four hours for a bed, according to the Times. Experts said the figures showed the financial pressures hospitals are currently facing. Mike Clancy, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said: “It’s a high pressure system and small changes in demand make a big change in waiting. We are asking wards to handle more patients faster.” Related Articles 67,000 NHS patients forced to wait up to 12 hours on A&amp;E trolleys Meanwhile, the number of patients waiting more than 12 hours for treatment at A&amp;E departments in Scotland has more than doubled since 2008, with targets missed in the cases of 882 people.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1345060654000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 15:57:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345060807000-100</Id><Topic><Title>Where Did The Hawcreek Team Go?</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1344970442000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 14:54:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poor craper.

At least one of the holes is being actively exploited by hackers to compromise Windows computers. The latest Patch Tuesday update from the company addresses these vulnerabilities, which are present in workstations and servers running Redmond operating systems. Most pressing of the critical batch is MS12-060, which is a fault in Windows Common Control that is being exploited in the wild. Victims merely have to open booby-trapped RTF files and Office documents, or visit a maliciously constructed web page, to fall foul of an attack. The files could be sent as email attachments. Other critical flaws exist in the Remote Administration Protocol (RAP) of Windows Networking; Internet Explorer versions 6 to 9; the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server in Windows XP; and a module in the Outlook Web Access (OWA) component of Microsoft Exchange Server &lt;&lt;</Msg><Username>phands.theapostate58</Username><Timestamp>1345070705000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 18:45:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345072222000-125</Id><Title>Obama's gonna win, so get over it!</Title><Msg>Most Americans can't relate to Romney/Ryan.

The average wait to see a new family dr in this country is just under three weeks according to a 2009 survey by medical consultancy Merritt Hawkins. But in Boston which established near universal coverage the wait is two months. When people cannot find a primary care physician who will see them in a reasonable time all too often they go to a hosptal emergency room. Yet in 2007 study of calif showed that up to 20% of the patient who entered an emergency room left without ever seeing a dr because they got tired of waiting. Be prepared for that situation to get worse. As concierge medicine will grow rapidly, we will quickly evolve into a two tiered healthcare system with those who can afford it gettig more care and better care. In the meantime, the most vulnerable populations will have less acess to care. Thank you for ObamaCare, but no doctor.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1345074708000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 19:51:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345075117000-134</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's gonna win, so get over it!</Title><Username>camel892</Username><Timestamp>1345072222000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 19:10:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and it's back to the Fort Meyers Work Camp with you.

In what alternate reality is does this Obama live? Barack Obama is a hard core Sal Alinsky community organizer. He is a communist, but he will never admit that. He is a socialist, but he will never admit that either. He may admit that he is a "Progressive" which is a synonym for communist and socialist. He is about a "right wing conservative" as Joe Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt or Woodrow Wilson. At the VERY LEAST he is a big government statist. He believes that its big government's job to solve everyones problems. He is also an arrogant SOB. One of the reasons he pushed and pushed on the Affordable Care Act is that HE wanted to be the President who brought nationalized healthcare to America, where the Clinton's failed. It is why he ignored unemployment and the economy and pushed on ObamaCommieCare for the first two years of his administration. It was only his glory and his legacy that mattered.

I assumed Ryan was some kind of economics guru the way he talks etc. Then when I saw the truth of his credentials, it is just outrageous. How much education do you need to do a budget? Add up you income in this column and add up your spending in that column and see how they compare. If they are approximately equal, Oh, Happy Day! Only minor adjustments are needed! If income is too high (in our case it is not) or spending is too high (in our case it is) then you need to make adjustments. In our particular case, income (revenue) has been rather constant at about $2.2 trillion per year, but spending has grown to about $3.6 trillion per year. You don't have to be a great economic guru to see that spending needs reduced. Spending is about 64% greater than income! (And being an "economic guru" doesn't necessarily help. Look at that nincompoop, Paul Krugman: advanced degrees in economics and a Nobel Prize in economics and almost everything out of his mouth is foolishness and nonsense. Further proof that the Nobel Committee gives out politically motivated awards to undeserving liberals.) And having advanced degrees doesn't seem to help either. Barack Obama has advanced degrees and made a budget that got turned down by both houses of congress. Not even his own party voted for it. And Harry Reid has advanced degrees and apparently doesn't see the need for a budget at all, since he blocks any attempt at making one.</Msg><Username>dr_gloom_and_doom</Username><Timestamp>1345085275000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 22:47:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345085441000-149</Id><Topic><Title>Ryan has a BA from some college</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1345000173000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:09:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then there are all those issues about "unfunded liabilities" future entitlement spending, future SS spending and future Medicare/Medicaid spending.

Is Linux more SECURE or is it just more OBSCURE? Windows has a 90+% market share: Linux has a 1.5% market share. One of the reasons games and other programs are not ported to Linux is because of the marginal market share. I've heard it said that one of the reasons more viruses &amp; maleware are not written for Linux is the same reason: marginal market share. If a barbarian vandal wants to cause havoc, the best way is to write some nasty-ware that will impact MILLIONS of computers using Windows, rather than the relatively small number using Linux. Or is there some reason why Linux is inherently more male-ware proof? Even though it's Open Source code is freely available to male-ware programmers? (Many of which I've heard are sponsored by the Russian or Chinese military.) Another active thread argues that most super computers and internet hubs and routers and internet connection hardware are Linux based, whiting a nasty code to screw these up would have a big wallop.
