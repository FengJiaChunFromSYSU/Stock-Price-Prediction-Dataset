I knew you could. http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nokia-scraps-mid-range-software-082801290.html Nokia scraps phone software to conserve cash: sources ReutersReuters – 15 minutes ago By Tarmo Virki HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish cellphone maker Nokia has ditched the software it was developing to compete with Google's mass-market Android phones, three sources with direct knowledge of the company's plans said, in its latest move to slash costs. Loss-making Nokia was hoping the Linux-based software platform, code-named Meltemi, would replace its aging Series 40 software in more advanced feature phones - mid-range phones that sit between basic models and sophisticated smartphones. Scrapping the platform means Nokia will risk losing its strong position in the mass-market, where phones are priced at $100-$200. Nokia controlled more than 20 percent of this market in the first quarter, according to research firm IDC. Nokia's Chief Executive Stephen Elop flagged Meltemi in a leaked video in mid-2011, but Nokia has never officially confirmed Meltemi existed. It declined to comment on Thursday. In June, Nokia said it would cut 10,000 jobs - one in five staff in its phone business - as it battles to pull the company out of the red. Talks over job cuts are scheduled to end this week in Finland. Shares in Nokia extended their gains on Thursday and were 6.1 percent higher at 1.56 euros by 9:28 a.m. EDT (1328 GMT). "With the pressure to make extreme cost-savings it is little surprise that it has been cut," said Canalys analyst Pete Cunningham. Launching and maintaining a software platform costs hundreds of millions of euros. One of the sources, who works at a supplier, said the original plan was for the first feature phones using Meltemi should to be on the market by now. Smartphones such as Apple's iPhone which offer a platform for third-party application developers, is where the industry's strongest growth is. But simpler feature phones, with limited support for third-party software, still account for most phones sold. Nokia's Series 40 platform is in around 2 billion cellphones, making it the most ubiquitous software in the market. But it lacks the smartphone-like experience, such as a wide choice of advanced applications, that Meltemi could have offered. Google's Android platform has stormed the smartphone market in its first few years. Last quarter it was used in roughly 60 percent of all smartphones sold. Nokia last year dumped its own smartphone software platforms in favor of Microsoft's Windows Phone, which has so far had a limited impact, in part due to the high prices of phones using it.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343311108000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 09:58:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343312316000-2</Id><Topic><Title>New Analysis on Microsoft Corporation Suggests Drop</Title><Username>shielaweynand</Username><Timestamp>1343311765000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:09:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ignore the spam malware virus links - by spammers.</Msg><Username>killspam13</Username><Timestamp>1343312316000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:18:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343312727000-3</Id><Title>Technical Chart Shows Upside on Microsoft Corporation</Title><Msg>Im in shock!Microsoft Corporation is on the verge of a major change in trend.

Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols By Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols for Linux and Open Source Patent Absurdity Microsoft has long made some nice cash from convincing Android vendors that they should pay them for Linux-related patents. Now, for the first time, a company that uses Linux on its servers. Amdocs has publicly paid off Microsoft for patents covering Linux. Mind you, there's never been any proof that Linux violates any of Microsoft's patents. Despite that, several C level executives have made similar contracts and tell me that Microsoft has been shaking them down for Linux patent licensing agreements for years. ..... Another told me that, When Microsoft bought the Novell patents in 2011, “We knew Microsoft had to share those patents under the GPLv2, but our in-house counsel thought that didn't mean that Microsoft still couldn't charge for their use.” So this business decided “It's just part of the cost of doing business with Microsoft if you use Linux in the data-center and who doesn't?” This doesn't come as much of a surprise for those of us who've been following the business side of Linux. Jim Zemlin, executive director at The Linux Foundation, said, "Microsoft's patent license agreements are not news. The company is trolling for dollars and companies are compelled to settle for less money than it would cost to litigate with Microsoft.”</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343314078000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:47:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343314087000-5</Id><Title>RSI looking very good on Microsoft Corporation</Title><Msg>Interesting insider activity on Microsoft Corporation http://BESTSTOCKRIGHTNOW.INFO</Msg><Username>wondatinnel</Username><Timestamp>1343314087000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 10:48:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343315818000-6</Id><Title>LIVE, news out!

"Ed Fries: What are some of the projects you’re working on? "Gabe Newell: When you think about the kinds of digital goods that people want to have, there has to be a richness. We call one of our tools Source Filmmaker, but it also encompasses things like comic books or posters. All our posters were created inside of tools that actually run inside our game engine. But the whole point is driven out of this idea that, rather than these islands of entertainment that we’ve had in the past, five or 10 years from now everything is going to be lumpy nodes in this overall economy. The debate that I have with our economist is how soon that overall economy will hit, say, 10 billion dollars. Then he wants to argue about what GDP represents in that, and you’re off to the races. "When you look at the other questions: Why are we looking at wearable computers? Why did we hire Jerry Ellsworth? Why do we have people working on Linux? That’s the second part of the problem. In order for this innovation to happen, a bunch of things that haven’t been happening on closed platforms have to occur and continue to occur. Valve wouldn’t exist if it weren’t for the PC. Id Software, Epic, Zynga, Facebook, and Google wouldn’t have existed without the openness of the platform. I think there’s a strong temptation to close the platform. If people look at what they can accomplish when they can limit competitors’ access to their platform, they say, “Wow, that’s really exciting.” Even some of the people who have open platforms, like Microsoft, get really excited by the idea that Netflix has to pay them rent in order to be on the Internet. "That’s not how we got here, and I don’t think that’s a very attractive future. So we’re looking at the platform, and up until now we’ve been a free rider. We’ve been able to benefit from everything that’s gone into the PC and the Internet. Now we have to start finding ways that we can continue to make sure there are open platforms. So that involves a couple of different things. "One, we’re trying to make sure that Linux thrives. Our perception is that one of the big problems holding Linux back is the absence of games. I think that a lot of people — in their thinking about platforms — don’t realize how critical games are as a consumer driver of purchases and usage. So we’re going to continue working with the Linux distribution guys, shipping Steam, shipping our games, and making it as easy as possible for anybody who’s engaged with us — putting their games on Steam and getting those running on Linux, as well. It’s a hedging strategy. "I think that Windows 8 is kind of a catastrophe for everybody in the PC space. I think that we’re going to lose some of the top-tier PC [original equipment manufacturers]. They’ll exit the market. I think margins are going to be destroyed for a bunch of people. If that’s true, it’s going to be a good idea to have alternatives to hedge against that eventuality. But when you start thinking about a platform, you have to address it. You have to address mobile. You have to look at what’s going to happen post-tablet. If you look at the mouse and keyboard, it was stable for about 25 years. I think touch will be stable for about 10 years. I think post-touch, and we’ll be stable for a really long time — for another 25 years. I think touch will be this intermediate…." http://venturebeat.com/2012/07/25/valves-gabe-newell-talks/</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343322943000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:15:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343324007000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Why Valve Wants To Port Games To Linux: Because Windows 8 Is a Catastrophe</Title><Username>manyhats23</Username><Timestamp>1343321627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 12:53:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sux haters and basher rage against Windows 8 because they know it will crush their crappy primitive toy OS</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1343324007000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 13:33:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343326184000-17</Id><Topic><Title>Why Valve Wants To Port Games To Linux: Because Windows 8 Is a Catastrophe</Title><Username>manyhats23</Username><Timestamp>1343321627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 12:53:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>*yawn* more nonsense from the wally bot.

By most measures, you'd think the Xbox business has been a raging success. Too bad you'd be wrong.

Naturally, component costs have come down dramatically since then, but let's take a deeper look. I went back and compiled more than 10 years of data, going back to the quarter that the first Xbox launched, to see how the console has fared in its operating segments over the years.

Of course, there have been other products in each of those segments over the years, such as Windows Mobile and Windows Phone, but the Xbox is a big contributor. The segment transitions are notated, along with both generations of consoles. The majority of the time is spent in operating red ink, and the cumulative losses of all of those divisions over the years is a whopping $4.1 billion. ....</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343329987000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 15:13:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343330315000-33</Id><Topic><Title>Why Valve Wants To Port Games To Linux: Because Windows 8 Is a Catastrophe</Title><Username>manyhats23</Username><Timestamp>1343321627000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 12:53:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;Any poster id is none of your business&gt; I don't even want to know, stupid, you're software anyway, not a person.
