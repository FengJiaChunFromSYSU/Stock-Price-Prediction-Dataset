PRESENT.</Title><Msg>Dear Mr. GATES: How are you Sir? Hope you are fine and thanks for all your philanthropic work, you set the example of what rich people should do. I want to propose to you this idea: The hardware wars are just starting, its the 1st inning of a full game, its the BIG PICTURE that matters here. When Apple came out with the iphone 1, iphone 2, 3, and 4 there was no WAR, but now with the Galaxy, WW1 of hardware has begun. MSFT has engaged the "Nook" but Mr. Gates, thats a very mild dab into the space. Dell is loaded with windows, its in every major corporation, together with your software. If MSFT wants to make a BOLD move, which it has not done in a LONG TIME, I propose to you Sir, consider an offer for the BEST IN CLASS windows hardware, by far and away, DELL. People like you make the phrase "Expect the Unexpected" true. Please surprise us Mr. Gates. Sincerely, "Miyamoto Musashi"</Msg><Username>miyamusa88</Username><Timestamp>1358315336095</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 00:48:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358315688694-2</Id><Topic><Title>Bing?</Title><Username>edwarddpeters</Username><Timestamp>1358280532140</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 15:08:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you missunderstood what I wanted to say. Zuckerberg is basically looking to add a search engine to his facebook; this will stream more $$$$ for both companies (FB and whoever the search engine). However, Zuckerberg did not mention who FB would partner with-- could either be Google or Bing. Google made its name because of the search engine; hence, I imagine it would be much harder for Google to be flexible to FB's terms of negotiations. Thus, I think msft the fact that they have an awesome search engine but way under utilized because of lack of popularity and losing money, msft is more likely to strike a deal with FB. Hence, FB will likely get a cheaper deal with msft than with Google. Therefore, Msft will most likely get that joint venture with FB, rather than google.</Msg><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358315688694</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 00:54:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358316884938-3</Id><Title>Top Ten REasons to Buy MSFT</Title><Msg>1) Laying dormant for 12 years, ready to explode 2) Windows 8 revolutionizes/hybridizes PC to touchpads 3) W8 sold 60 million copies in 10 weeks and counting.

And what I keep seeing on the web are comments saying that FB is trying to compete with Google in search. Certainly they could compete as partners but I wasn't seeing it that way based on what I read. But there doesn't seem to be any announcement yet and it's also not impossible that FB could be rolling out their own search facility. So for now all I can do is wait to see what really happens.</Msg><Username>fan_tazer</Username><Timestamp>1358317195004</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:19:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358317374036-5</Id><Topic><Title>Top Ten REasons to Buy MSFT</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358316884938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:14:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>11) Bing, almost completely forgot. Joint venture with FB exposes Bing to much publicity and incomes. If anyone has ever used Bing, you would realize it has more contents than Google. Its ONLY downside is lack in popularity-- it's difficult to compete with Google search egnine that has become a "verb" in our culture, but FB exposure may just do it for msft in this arena. Even if I wanted to use Bing, I still accidently type Google in the address bar--- old habit is hard to break.</Msg><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358317374036</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:22:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358317720836-6</Id><Topic><Title>Bing?</Title><Username>edwarddpeters</Username><Timestamp>1358280532140</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-15 15:08:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just saw this: wiredDOTcom /business/2013/01/the-inside-story-of-graph-search-facebooks-weapon-to-challenge-google/all/</Msg><Username>fan_tazer</Username><Timestamp>1358317720836</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:28:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358319515131-7</Id><Topic><Title>Top Ten REasons to Buy MSFT</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358316884938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:14:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reasons not to buy MSFT: 1) Lying dormant for 12 years 2) Windows 8 3) sold 60 million licenses to OEMs, no other data given out 4) Surface 5) Stock trending down 6) Windows phones selling poorly 7) AAPL 8) institutional owners weigh on price 9) lumbering bureaucracy 10) losing out in mobile</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1358319515131</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:58:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358319788090-8</Id><Topic><Title>Top Ten REasons to Buy MSFT</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358316884938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:14:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>11) Bing eminently forgettable</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1358319788090</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 02:03:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358322898175-9</Id><Topic><Title>Top Ten REasons to Buy MSFT</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358316884938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:14:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>2 questions: 1- What is "Surface"? 2- what is this "Bing" is it a bingo online game?</Msg><Username>tres333three</Username><Timestamp>1358322898175</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 02:54:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>9</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358328251567-10</Id><Topic><Title>Top Ten REasons to Buy MSFT</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358316884938</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 01:14:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surface is Microsoft's attempt to copy iPad.

The facts were, if an employer wasn't offering $8 or $9 per hour they would have trouble attracting new employees."" I would like to see a source on this. And it is inadequate analysis to assume that the fed min wage floor does not affect wages paid above this floor. If abolished some would no doubt see their pay drop and this would put downward pressure on those making above min. Yes business has clients to serve and need a labor force but this not eliminate the possibility of a slow downward trend in wages if min wage laws were canceled. Companies are reluctant to commit cash because they don't believe markets exist mainly due to the greatly decreased purchasing power of the middle class. The rest is not relevant. Remember the question or challenge was to support a concept of what the steady state situation of the poor would be without progressive measures.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1358348671429</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 10:04:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358349142455-27</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT dirt cheap here</Title><Username>krismanderson</Username><Timestamp>1358343640829</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 08:40:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one see's that MS will explode by mid year....dumb is dumb....too much hype on that bad apple</Msg><Username>jravera</Username><Timestamp>1358349142455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 10:12:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358349217204-28</Id><Topic><Title>The Tea Party Nut Jobs Are Talking Impeachment.

The story of the Challenger disaster refutes that view. I was viewing some videos on YouTube, for purposes of my own, pertaining to Richard Feynman, an actual scientist, one of the most brilliant who ever lived -- and never a NASA employee. An episode late in Feynman's life did involve NASA, however. In the aftermath of the Challenger disaster in 1986, Feynman was recruited as part of the blue-ribbon panel to investigate the cause of the disaster. As Feynman told the story afterward, he was "played" by someone inside NASA, who hinted to him, at his own home, as if by accident, what the cause might have been -- O-ring seals malfunctioning at low temperatures. The NASA employee knew what the cause had been, but also knew that if he said what he knew publicly, he would be fired, as another employee had already been fired for that reason. To make the cause known, it was necessary to go by way of someone outside NASA, not an employee, someone with unchallengeable credentials as a scientist, therefore someone who could not be silenced and would be believed. NASA management had been informed of the O-ring problem BEFORE the mission launch by its own engineers. NASA management ignored its own engineers and sent the crew to their deaths, for political reasons. And then they tried to cover it up afterwards. NASA's committee chairman attempted to delete Feynman's contribution from the committee report, and any other reference to the O-ring problem, but Feynman threatened not to sign the report unless it was included. What was eventually included was much watered down. So much for scientific objectivity at NASA.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1358361383583</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:36:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358361390805-61</Id><Topic><Title>I would be shocked if MSFT reported anything less than stellar earnings....</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358358408978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:46:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why is there mostly bad news vs good news in the media re: MSFT and why don't they advertise?</Msg><Username>hapi2lips</Username><Timestamp>1358361390805</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:36:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358361606220-62</Id><Topic><Title>I would be shocked if MSFT reported anything less than stellar earnings....</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358358408978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:46:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They have been advertising.. are you a sports type because allmost every nfl game this year and during the bowl games for college football they have been advertising... what are you talking about</Msg><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358361606220</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:40:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358361814985-63</Id><Topic><Title>I would be shocked if MSFT reported anything less than stellar earnings....</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358358408978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:46:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The only thing that bothers me- they may have paid out a lot $$$s to get this stuff in the pipeline I "believe" next quarter will show the fruits of their labor</Msg><Username>mikemclaug</Username><Timestamp>1358361814985</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:43:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358361837578-64</Id><Topic><Title>I would be shocked if MSFT reported anything less than stellar earnings....</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358358408978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:46:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your right that the media has been extremely negative towards msft.. i think the stocks remains undervalued until we get real analyst that care more about a companies fundamentals instead of hype stocks like fb...</Msg><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358361837578</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:43:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358361998049-65</Id><Topic><Title>I would be shocked if MSFT reported anything less than stellar earnings....</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358358408978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:46:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why is the media so negative when it comes to MSFT?

I can understand home schooling from segregationist parents would lead to continued ignorance, but somewhere someone must have taught you people something about reasoning.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1358362173134</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:49:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358362348448-67</Id><Topic><Title>People with prescription drugs at greater risk of dying from overdose</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1358359053764</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:57:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OMG yur dumb</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1358362348448</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:52:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358362400046-68</Id><Topic><Title>People with cars at greater risk of dying in car accident</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1358359003979</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:56:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OMG yur dumb</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1358362400046</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:53:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358362436218-69</Id><Topic><Title>I would be shocked if MSFT reported anything less than stellar earnings....</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358358408978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:46:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe.... if he delivers this quarter i do not care if they do not like him or not....i will rethink msft after they report if earnings disapoint... i do not believe the company can afford any more negative press....will they deliver? lets hope so...</Msg><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358362436218</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 13:53:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358362543087-70</Id><Topic><Title>I would be shocked if MSFT reported anything less than stellar earnings....</Title><Username>richeydouglas</Username><Timestamp>1358358408978</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:46:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rarely ever watch games.

Guns should be kept safely, so how is someone going to get one in the spit second an intruder breaks down the door. I had a personal experience as a kid of about 9. My friends dad, a wwII vet, had his 45 in a dresser drawer, and my friend found where he "hid" the bullets. We used to sneak in a play with the gn. In Colorado Sprongs in those days in the mid 50's we had incinerators in the back yards. My friend threw some bullets in for fun. They went off, and one made a line on the side of his head, luckily no one was hurt. We both got it big time that evening. So, gun nuts, where are you going to hide your guns from your kids? Do you know no one is more inventive than a kid who knows something is forbidden, and hidden? Idiots with guns and no compassion for others who lost children. It is more important to not give in on an argument, than to save children's lives. It is not conservative to have fewer gun laws, it is liberal.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1358362917241</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 14:01:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358363192794-72</Id><Title>Low Expectations</Title><Msg>Frome the price action, not much is expected from MSFT</Msg><Username>hapi2lips</Username><Timestamp>1358363192794</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 14:06:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358363289337-73</Id><Topic><Title>People With Guns In Home At Greater Risk!!</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1358358391276</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-16 12:46:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$ you liberal ..If you got a gun you must understand how to use it and keep it safe.
