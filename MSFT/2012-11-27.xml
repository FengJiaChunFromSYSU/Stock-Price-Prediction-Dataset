Some GOP lawmakers now flout anti-tax man Norquist By PHILIP ELLIOTT, Associated Press – 4 hours ago WASHINGTON (AP) — For decades, conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist vowed to drive Republicans out of office if they didn't pledge to oppose tax increases. Many lawmakers signed on. But now, several senior Republicans are breaking ranks, willing to consider raising more money through taxes as part of a deal with Democrats to avoid a catastrophic budget meltdown. Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker says the only pledge he will keep is his oath of office. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor says no one in his home state of Virginia is talking about what leaders in Washington refer to simply as "The Pledge," a Norquist invention that dates to 1986. Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss says he cares more about his country than sticking to Norquist's pledge. It's quite an about-face for senior members of a party that long has stood firmly against almost any notion of tax increases. And while GOP leaders insist they still don't want to see taxes go up, the reality of a nation in a debt crisis is forcing some to moderate their opposition to any movement on how much Americans pay to fund their government. Republican legislators and Democratic President Barack Obama's White House are haggling vigorously as they look for ways to reach agreement on detailed tax adjustments and spending cuts before automatic, blunt-force changes occur at the new year. "Oh, I signed it," Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama said on Fox News about Norquist's pledge, adding he still supports its goals. "But we've got to deal with the crisis we face. We've got to deal with the political reality of the president's victory."

Then, I made the decision to buy a Surface because it has Office preinstall. I was expecting a good tablet, but I was not expecting such a high quality product from Microsoft, really...I was not...but I can honestly admit now that the iPad looks old (no Keyboard cover) and limited (no USB or HDMI out) when comparing it with Surface. Furthermore, I tried also (just for fun) a Samsung Galaxy (for 15 minutes), and the Galaxy looks like a toy when comparing it with both the iPad and Surface. My overall conclusion is: if the Surface had more apps (e.g.: Sonos, Pandora, CNN, a few more) I would definitely sale my iPad (when I can still get some serious $$ for it) and keep the Surface is my primary tablet and laptop.

The issue has occurred despite the tablets only being on sale two weeks, and some users have taken to the Surface forums to complain about the split. "My Touch Cover, in the middle at the join to the screen, is peeling. Like the top layer has come loose and is ruffling up," a user by the name of 'Br1an_G' wrote last week. Since then, other users have complained of the same issue occurring in the same place, as well as other problems with the Microsoft logo printed on the tablet. "Right in the middle on the seam it tore open, and pretty quickly too," 'whyjoe' wrote on the Surface Forum. "On another note, that Microsoft logo on the back is certainly not etched or painted on very well. Mine is already rubbing off." Others on the forum suggested that the problem may not be present in the black Touch Type keyboard as it has a different material on the bottom. ZDNet's Matt Baxter-Reynolds, whose keyboard suffered the splitting, also noted that the Touch Cover has a ridge where the ribbon connector is that isn't present on the Type Cover. Microsoft acknowledged the issue in a statement sent to ZDNet on Friday. "Microsoft makes every effort to ensure our customers receive a high quality product. We are in active contact with our Customer Support operations and are aware of a small number of instances of material separation," the spokeswoman said. Customers with any concerns about their keyboard are advised by Microsoft to contact customer support with their queries.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1354027540031</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:45:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354027637821-23</Id><Topic><Title>I can't even buy a Surface tablet in Michigan for Ch---- Sakes #$%$</Title><Username>db4759</Username><Timestamp>1354023976985</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 08:46:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New Delhi: One of the major features of Microsoft's Surface tablet, apart from the new operating system, is its key accessory, the Touch Cover, which features an integrated keyboard. However, early adopters of the tablet who have this accessory are facing some issues with the Touch Cover where it splits at the seams, exposing some of its internal wiring in the process. A report by The Guardian states that early users of the Touch Cover of Microsoft's Surface tablet say one of the edges that magnetically connect to the device split at the seam, and this case has been witnessed by a number of users a few days after they started using it. The report states that it is unclear whether the problems that people have encountered are due to a faulty batch or are a subtle problem that will become more apparent as more people use it for longer. The fact that users in the US and the UK have reported the problem suggests that it is not isolated to a single manufacturing batch.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1354027637821</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:47:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354027651453-24</Id><Topic><Title>Simple question for simpletons CFury and predisposable Moe</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1354025656520</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:14:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And every libdem counts the increased revenue they will get from raising taxes, and everytime the tax revenue shrinks.

One of the most serious issues is concerning the keyboard, which is apparently peeling at the top seam where it connects to the tablet device. The top layer has come loose, so it’s pretty easy to remove it by mistake, one user said on the Surface Forums. What’s more, it appears that the Microsoft logo on the back of the tablet is rubbing off and, as far users are concerned, there’s absolutely no way to prevent or repair this. “Right in the middle on the seam it tore open, and pretty quickly too. I'm gonna exchange it this weekend. On another note, that Microsoft logo on the back is certainly not etched or painted on very well. Mine is already rubbing off. Those two things, combined with the #$%$ sticker on the charger, make me wonder about the fit and finish,” one of the users wrote. The interesting side of the story is that the Microsoft staff at official stores across the world is quickly replacing the devices, without too many questions. One user explains that the entire process took less than two minutes and, although Microsoft’s employees admitted they hadn’t seen such a damaged keyboard before, they replaced it in no time. Of course, we’re yet to hear from Microsoft on all these bugs and the company is still looking into ways to fix the previously spotted software issue that unexpectedly mutes the sound when using the cover. Let’s just hope that Microsoft will find a quick way to deal with all these complaints.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1354027801045</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 09:50:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354027965935-26</Id><Topic><Title>I can't even buy a Surface tablet in Michigan for Ch---- Sakes #$%$</Title><Username>db4759</Username><Timestamp>1354023976985</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 08:46:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Gadget fans’ outrage as screens of new Microsoft tablets break within days of use Consumers who purchased Microsoft’s new Surface tablet are reporting issues of the product’s Touch Cover screen 'peeling' Consumers in the U.S. and the U.K have reported the same issue with the product By DAILY MAIL REPORTER PUBLISHED: 09:44 EST, 10 November 2012 | UPDATED: 11:52 EST, 10 November 2012 Microsoft’s attempt to rival Apple’s iPad with its own tablet may fall short due to malfunctions. Consumers who purchased Microsoft’s new Surface tablet are voicing frustrations about the product’s faulty Touch Cover screen. A number of early buyers of the gadget, including several tech writers and developers, have reported issues of the screen splitting and exposing an internal wire after just a few days of use, the Guardian reports. 'My touch cover, in the middle at the join to the screen is peeling, like the top layer has come loose and is ruffling up,' one Surface buyer wrote on a forum for the product. 'Worried its going to get worse as I use it more.' The defect appears to be the same in each case -- the Surface’s cover, which has a built-in keyboard, comes apart at its seam. Users have also reported issues with the tablet’s sound, according to Geeky Gadgets. Microsoft would not comment on the number reports of the problem the company had received. 'Microsoft makes every effort to ensure our customers receive a high quality product,' the company told CNET. 'We are in active contact with our Customer Support operations and are aware of a small number of instances of material separation.

Unofficially, state officials are trying to have Sandy declared a "tropical storm" so the the higher hurricane deductibles on home &amp; business insurance will not be activated. Fact is, Hurricane Sandy was wavering between Tropical Storm and Category 1 hurricane. It made landfall with minimum hurricane winds. There is also much blab on PBS about Hurricane Sandy and "global warming" and "climate change." The truth is Hurricane Sandy came ashore at a bad angle, with NYC on the windward side. This is pretty much the luck of the draw. I use to have a software called HurrTrak which would plot the storms within one degree (latitude-longitude) of a selected coordinate. I would bet there were at least a dozen hurricanes in the last 125 years that had TS or CAT-1 winds over the same landfall spot as Sandy. Next, there is a well known geography problem for NYC. Hurricanes pull water along the south shore of Long Island and push it into New York Harbor. This magnifies any storm surge. This geography is not caused by global warming. Further, we had the bad luck of having the hurricane make landfall during a full moon high tide. This magnified the storm surge even more. Full moon high tides are not caused by "global warming." Hurricane Gloria of 1985 came ashore on Long Island with low Category 3 winds, thus much worse Hurricanes than Sandy are clearly plausible. (The 1938 Great New England Hurricane may have had higher Category 3 winds.) I have publications from the National Weather Service which have done regular studies on this. As early as the 1950's they predicted that Category 3 hurricanes should be expected in New Jersey, New York &amp; Long Island. Clearly, much worse hurricanes are plausible for NY, NJ, Long Island and New England, regardless of "global warming"!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1354030451485</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 10:34:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354030881563-41</Id><Topic><Title>1.8 million windows 8 units sold yesterday</Title><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1354022041515</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 08:14:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No doubt the number refers to licenses sold to OEM's, not sales to end users.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1354030881563</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 10:41:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354030950000-42</Id><Topic><Title>Corporate profits are at record highs and tax revenues are at 60 year lows as percentage of GDP</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1354029310730</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 10:15:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AND this article contains the truth about our economy.

The three companies sold a large number of Windows 8 PCs last week as consumers endured massive crowds and long lines on the biggest shopping day of the year. In conducting a retail survey, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry found that Acer and Sony produced the "hottest-selling Windows 8 notebooks." According to Chowdhry, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Stores had a "very strong promotion" on the Acer Aspire V5 notebook, which is powered by an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) Core i5 processor. He estimates that each Microsoft Store had about 500 units. "[They] were completely sold out within the first 30 minutes," Chowdhry wrote in a note to investors and reporters. During the promotional period, Microsoft sold the Aspire V5 for $399. Not to be outdone, some Microsoft Stores also sold out of a $1,500 touch-enabled Ultrabook from Sony. "Sony Vaio Touch Intel i7 was the fastest selling Windows 8 notebook in the high-end category," Chowdhry added. While this may be the year that the desktop PC died, Dell has not given up on the market. And it's a good thing, too -- if it had, it could not have built the fastest-selling all-in-one Windows 8 desktop. On Black Friday, Dell's XPS One 27 earned that crown. Chowdhry said that while he could not get any color on the number of units available, the converged view was that the "demand was too high" for Dell's $2,000 machine. Not every Windows 8 device performed well on Black Friday. Chowdhry estimated that Microsoft lost one in five sales on the Surface RT because of the ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH) chipset. "Had Microsoft first shipped Surface on Intel chips vs. on ARM chips, sales of Surface would have been 5X better than current levels," the analyst wrote. Regardless, Chowdhry found that Microsoft "had decent sales on Windows Surface RT." "We observed a lot of interest in Microsoft Surface, but interest was not necessarily leading to sales," he said. "We spoke to no less than 30 people, who showed the most interest in Microsoft Surface RT, but did not make the purchase. 'We are going to wait for the Pro version of the Surface, as that will run on Intel Chips,' was the unanimous view we got." .</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1354033141892</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 11:19:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354033446819-48</Id><Title>Dell Sony MSFT sales explode on Black Friday due to W-8</Title><Msg>Sony, Dell Win Big with Windows 8 Sales Louis Bedigian, Benzinga Staff Writer November 26, 2012 1:33 PM Tickers: ARMH, DELL, INTC, MSFT, SNE Sony, Dell (NASDAQ: DELL) and Acer appear to have had a successful Black Friday.

"Sony Vaio Touch Intel i7 was the fastest selling Windows 8 notebook in the high-end category," Chowdhry added. While this may be the year that the desktop PC died, Dell has not given up on the market. And it's a good thing, too -- if it had, it could not have built the fastest-selling all-in-one Windows 8 desktop. On Black Friday, Dell's XPS One 27 earned that crown. Chowdhry said that while he could not get any color on the number of units available, the converged view was that the "demand was too high" for Dell's $2,000 machine. Not every Windows 8 device performed well on Black Friday. Chowdhry estimated that Microsoft lost one in five sales on the Surface RT because of the ARM (NASDAQ: ARMH) chipset. "Had Microsoft first shipped Surface on Intel chips vs. on ARM chips, sales of Surface would have been 5X better than current levels," the analyst wrote. Regardless, Chowdhry found that Microsoft "had decent sales on Windows Surface RT."</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1354034052314</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 11:34:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354034196176-54</Id><Title>Windows 8 Sony Dell sales explode on Black Friday</Title><Msg>Sony, Dell Win Big with Windows 8 Sales Louis Bedigian, Benzinga Staff Writer November 26, 2012 1:33 PM Tickers: ARMH, DELL, INTC, MSFT, SNE Sony (NYSE: SNE [FREE Stock Trend Analysis]), Dell (NASDAQ: DELL) and Acer appear to have had a successful Black Friday.

I hear large corporate profits are high because they are doing a lot of business overseas in places such as China, India &amp; EU. In many cases those overseas profits are also not subject to US tax. Thus tax collections are down while profits are up. Wages in US would be for wages in US when economic activity has been suppressed due to a recession. We still have 7.9% unemployment and millions of people have dropped out of the employment market. So wages are down. What a surprise! I would think even cstupidforyerself can calculate that.

"Microsoft’s Xbox Blows Wii U’s First Week Sales Out of the Water November 27, 2012 at 12:27 pm PT inShare SharePrint Microsoft said today that the seven-year-old Xbox 360 outsold the Nintendo Wii U during the new console’s first week on sale. In a blog post, Microsoft’s Major Nelson reported that the Xbox 360 sold more than 750,000 consoles in the U.S. last week to easily beat Wii U sales of 400,000. What’s more, it even exceeds the 700,000 units Nintendo sold of the Wii U and the original Wii combined. In some ways, however, the two numbers are not comparable. The Wii U, which launched last Sunday, costs between $300 and $350, and Microsoft is selling the Xbox for a number of configurations starting at half that price. Additionally, sales of the Wii U were limited by the number of units Nintendo could manufacturer, with many retailers reporting that inventory was sold out. Microsoft said the 750,000 consoles it sold between Sunday, Nov. 18 (when the Wii U launched), and Black Friday exceeded its internal forecasts. At that rate, the numbers are absolutely staggering, especially given the amount of pressure that phones and tablets are putting on the TV consoles as alternative gaming devices. Last month, Microsoft sold 270,000 Xbox units, making it the best-selling console in the U.S. at the time. But access to streaming media and other entertainment is helping to drive sales of the older hardware. As Major Nelson pointed out today, Microsoft’s three-month Xbox Live Gold Subscription sales increased more than 50 percent compared to the same week last year. On Sunday, its Xbox Live services — which include streaming video and multi-player game play — were used by more than 14 million people, racking up more than 72 million hours worldwide. Compared to 2011, Microsoft has seen a 43 percent increase in U.S. hours logged on Xbox Live during the week of Black Friday. I asked Sony for its sales figures for the past week, but the company has not responded to the request."</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1354049894477</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 15:58:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354050315504-152</Id><Title>Romney Sang "America The Beautiful" Off Key Like An A-whole</Title><Msg>Very patriotic that Miff Romney and his Republican cohorts are.

I was polling really well until late August, but then it all just kind of unraveled,” said Akin, adding that he was “still piecing together” the causes of his collapse. “I just keep replaying those weeks and months over and over in my head, searching for something, anything, that I could have said or done differently, and absolutely nothing comes to mind. Maybe it was my views on tax reform that did me in. I don’t know.” Akin then reportedly called his friend, fellow defeated Senate candidate Richard Mourdock, to offer his condolences and remark on “what a crazy, random world we live in.”</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1354056081921</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 17:41:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354056307149-176</Id><Title>AllthingsD.....humpa..humpa..humpa.

We just have to regroup, reconfigure a few things, and continue spreading our message to the American people that the man to lead this country forward is Mitt Romney.” “We’re in this for the long haul,” Rhoades continued. “So we’re not going to let something minor, like not getting enough votes in the electoral college, set us back.” According to sources, Romney plans to run fresh attack ads next week in several of the swing states he lost, including Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and his campaign has already scheduled additional rallies and fundraising dinners across the country.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1354056701606</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-27 17:51:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354056771578-179</Id><Title>Kim Kommando is hyperventilating.

In fact, MSFt sells Offcie speciafically for Apple PCs, and soon MSFt will possibly start to sell Office to Ipads. Recent weakness in MSFt is mainly due to fear that Win 8 is not doing well. However, according to todays announce of some 40 millions of Win 8 sold already in a single month, this shold searve as the catalyst for a possible major turn around for the share price. If anything, I am edxpecting some big move tomorrow!!!!! You have got to believe many analysts are paying attention to MSFt 's announccement for Win 8 sales so far.

I hear large corporate profits are high because they are doing a lot of business overseas in places such as China, India &amp; EU. In many cases those overseas profits are also not subject to US tax. Thus tax collections are down while profits are up. Wages in US would be for wages in US when economic activity has been suppressed due to a recession. We still have 7.9% unemployment and millions of people have dropped out of the employment market. So wages are down. What a surprise! I would think even cstupidforyerself can calculate that.
