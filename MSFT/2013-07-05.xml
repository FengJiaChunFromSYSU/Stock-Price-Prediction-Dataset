It was working fine, but the case shattered, and the damage included jamming the CPU fan, and the repair cost was way more than it was worth. So, I bought a new one - a core i7 Asus with 8G RAM, 1Tb disk and NVidia GT650M graphics on a 1920x1080 ful HD screen, and great audio (Bang &amp; Olufsen). It came with bloody awful windoze 8, so i now count as a purchaser for M$. I'll try for a refund of the windoze tax, but I already wiped the HDD and installed Linux (SuSE 12.3). UEFI secure boot is a pain in the bum, but once I switched it off Linux installs and boots like lightning. The only oddity is having to have /boot/UEFI as a windoze FAT partition, but I didn't have time to fix all the issues (even if possible), as I needed to get back to work. I played with w8 for a while before nuking it....suspicions confirmed....it is APALLING. I was going to dual boot, just to see how it went, but a short time with w8 convinced me that it is a waste of disk space, so it's gone. Everything works great -even the Nouveau driver is pretty solid and capable nowadays - even got full compositing on KDE . Once agaiin. no M$ in my life!</Msg><Username>the.heretic7</Username><Timestamp>1373030640345</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:24:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373030662635-10</Id><Topic><Title>Just had to buy a new laptop at short notice: win 8 is unusable garbage.</Title><Username>the.heretic7</Username><Timestamp>1373030640345</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:24:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Windoze is garbage</Msg><Username>the.heretic7</Username><Timestamp>1373030662635</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:24:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373030850166-11</Id><Topic><Title>Don't forget, republican conservatives were against a women's</Title><Username>tocrazyright</Username><Timestamp>1372946071827</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-07-04 09:54:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't forget, Democrats were against the abolition of slavery.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1373030850166</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-07-05 09:27:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373031041238-12</Id><Topic><Title>DRAM $3.7 ..12-MONTH TARGET: $30+...REASONS: 1) RAISING 2013 MEMORY PRICES, 2) NEW MEMORY/SOFTWARE MANUFACTURING DEAL WITH AMD, 3) LO FLOAT</Title><Username>accountislate</Username><Timestamp>1372273549925</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-06-26 15:05:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In mid May 2013 AMD and Dataram Corp. (NASDAQ: DRAM) separately announced their deal with each other for DRAM to manufacture the new super fast AMD Radeon Gamer Series RG2133 memory modules for the fast growing global gaming business. Additionally, AMD is using DRAM's RAMDisk technology to drive all of its Radeon products. Even without this huge AMD deal, DRAM was on the verge of returning to profitability because of improving fundamentals in the memory industry (DRAM's bread and butter up to now). Since the end of last quarter ended January 31, 2013, memory prices have jumped an additional 50%. Together with improving memory bsuiness and the new AMD windfall which started in May 2013, DRAM is poised to explode because it's current market cap is only $7 million and it's trading below 0.2 X sales compared to a 1.5 sector average. Here are a couple of customer reviews of the DRAM-manufactured RG2133 memory modules (Newegg website): Customer Reviews of the AMD Radeon RG2133 Gamer Series 16GB (4 x 4GB) â€“ Newegg @ $154 A - 5 Star Review Easily overclocked/superfast Pros: fast and reliable top of the line ram. Thinking of getting more for the second PC i'm building. Cons: N/A Other Thoughts: Really fast. A definite increase in browser speed and minuscule fps gain. If you're in the department for some new ram, this AMD ram takes the cake IMO 3 out of 3 people found this review helpful. Did you? B - 5 Star Review Great Memory from AMD Pros: AMP support for AMD systems.Low profile head spreader and legit design, detected running at 30C in my case. Memory testing yields 100% solid performance, no errors in 2133 with advertised timings. Cons: Expensive? You can find significantly cheaper but I'm a sucker for AMD products NOTE...

"On a smartphone and a tablet, the ARM/Android combination provides a useful "computing" experience for most users.
