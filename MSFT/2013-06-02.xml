For you that are not up to speed with tech. that means you will be able to see whoever you are speaking to in full high definition on your tv. I am not sure why anyone would need a home phone with cell and Skype phone. The cable is RUMORED ~however I am taking this lightly as all cable companies are different~ to be pay by channel. That would be some small miracle if Microsoft managed to get all the cable companies to offer cheaper fees and you will only pay for the channels you want. I would highly suspect that one co. has agreed to that and if that is your company your are in luck. It would seem impossible that all have agreed. Has anyone heard of Microsoft Entertainment? You will. They have made exclusive deals with the NFL. Yes, the NFL and the NFL is going to be using surface computers in the stadium and there may be some xbox exclusive equip. on sidelines. Steven Speiberg will direct a tv exclusive called Halo. The game is becoming a show I believe. So Microsoft will be competing with Netflix. I would short Netflix in a quick second. What exclusive music can only spark the imagination. The music industry was ituned into ruins. Maybe the home experience will offer an alternative and bring back live show and will let musicians make a living. The surfing the web on a Nokia 928 while you watch tv is great. The voice controlled seamless features of tv on, tv find this show are amazing.

Why would they? What is "in fact" is that most can buy a computer that will do whatever they need do for $200 used, like new with W7. The mystique of the PC is waning and it is becoming just a tool for more and more. W8 is a touch screen tablet OS, no other real reason to relearn an OS for 90%++ of all users. It's like getting the latest version of Office. Well over 90% of the previous users do not need the new features 2000 or 2003 has all most need.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1370180235560</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 09:37:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370186160386-16</Id><Topic><Title>8 Things Windows 8 Tablets Can Do That The iPad Can't....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1370103697299</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 12:21:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The whole win 8 tablet marketing has been slowed by INTC being slow with their chips.

PART DUEX.......</Title><Msg>Rove lied about his association with GPS by leaving out one important detail. Rove isn’t on the board, but GPS works in direct conjunction with the group Rove founded and still advises, American Crossroads. Rove saying that he isn’t involved with GPS was just like Mitt Romney claiming that his presidential campaign wasn’t involved with the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future. Plouffe was correct. Liberal groups were also targeted by the IRS. Bloomberg reported that the IRS sent the same letter to Democrats that they sent to tea partiers. The IRS did something to the liberal group Emerge America that they never did to the conservatives. They revoked their tax exempt status. Stop me if you have heard this one before, but when confronted with evidence of the Bush administration targeting liberal groups, all Rove could do was stammer the word baloney repeatedly. Under George W. Bush, the IRS investigated the NAACP’s tax status for two years. Rove even gave the reason for the payback when he pointed to the Bush administration’s outrage over an ad that the NAACP had run. It is easy to see why Rove’s Crossroads groups have had so little success taking on the president. David Plouffe ran circles around Karl and his talking points. Rove kept shifting his story so much that he went from blaming Obama to blaming Democratic senators to blaming the culture at the IRS. Rove is supposed be one of the Republican Party’s great spin masters, but even he couldn’t make these IRS allegations stick. The threads are starting to show on the IRS scandal, and the whole thing is looking more than a little ratty. Rove was right about one thing. There is some serious baloney being thrown around, and it’s the Republican Party tossing it.</Msg><Username>betr_pckr</Username><Timestamp>1370207742646</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 17:15:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370208349678-30</Id><Topic><Title>POLITICO ARTIC.

The answer is "probably". Quoting: "How far can Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) go in the cloud computing game? Though Amazon Web Services is already believed to be clocking around $2 billion a year, a report indicates that number could grow to an imposing $24 billion in the next decade, which would make Amazon a terror to all competitors and possibly give the tech giant a monopoly in the industry. "A report by Morgan Stanley analysts sees Amazon in the top five and gaining fast in cloud computing, which they believe will have a TAM of $152 billion ten years from now. As for the inevitability of a world turning entirely to cloud services by 2022, that’s considered a given, and bad news for companies like NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and EMC (NYSE:EMC). Of course, someone will need to be the host, so the market for servers won’t entirely disappear, Morgan Stanley’s analysts noted. "The other aspect of Amazon’s all-out assault is in the enterprise software realm. VMware (NYSE:VMW) is on notice in this department, as is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) itself, since AWS is building database and storage potential. While such analyses of Amazon Web Services’ power may sound overblown, Macquarie took a similar view earlier in the year, giving AWS the overwhelming share of a projected $71 billion business by 2015."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1370209315495</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 17:41:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370209425980-34</Id><Topic><Title>8 Things Windows 8 Tablets Can Do That The iPad Can't....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1370103697299</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 12:21:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is changing.

As he explained it, what appeared to be your intentional and politically motivated punitive, totalitarian, and chilling measures against conservative groups and individuals in a clandestine effort to affect the outcome of the election were, in fact, simply the inadvertent consequences of "horrible customer service" provided by a bunch of flunkies in Cincinnati. What a relief! Which brings me to the purpose of this letter. As you may recall, my business is being audited for reporting gross annual income of $12,125 when, as your revenue agents have so snarkily noted, the actual figure is closer to $9.75 million. As I have repeatedly explained, though I signed the tax return as CEO, this regrettable mistake is attributable to Trixie, our bookkeeper who forgot to disclose in her job interview that she had failed arithmetic for seven straight years before dropping out of grade school and joining an outlaw biker gang. To further explain, when I first met Trixie in a Las Vegas hot tub, she was employed in the escort hospitality industry. Though I found her to be amply well-qualified for a position under me, I must admit that the subject of her math skills may not have been sufficiently discussed under the distracting circumstances. Boy, have I learned my lesson! No more job interviews of bikini-clad women in hot tubs! In any event, I wish to apologize to you for the somewhat inaccurate tax return and the horrible customer service that produced it. Once I learned how the error had occurred, I immediately removed Trixie as bookkeeper and put her in charge of our Obamacare Compliance Unit. So, as you can see, we took the problem seriously, and it has been solved. In light of my sincere apology and prompt corrective measures, I ask that you cease your efforts to collect all back taxes, penalties, and interest. Hopefully this apology will mark a new beginning to our relationship, one based on mutual trust and belief in each other's integrity.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1370218001058</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-02 20:06:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370218884648-52</Id><Topic><Title>Which skirt was Bill Clinton chasing the SIX times he turned down Osama bin Laden?</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1370035665241</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 17:27:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's right ... it was no ones business..

When the commander in Chief violates federal law and military regulations that would result in the dishonorable discharge of any officer if discovered, you're damned right it's my business. Then when he lies under oath he should have been shown the door. The President doing it is arguably far more damaging to the nation than a mere officer. Further when one sees how far he went to prevent the discovery, blackmail would have been easy.
