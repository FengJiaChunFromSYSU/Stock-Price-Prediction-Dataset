But for Obama's strong decision making ability, as befits the Commander in Chief, OBL would no doubt be alive. All your talking won't change that.

However I do believe in the sequence of things to come. E3 is Monday, thus, Thursday and Fri we may have rallies that may bring this closer to $40. Then when Monday comes around and people actually have a chance to experience the Xbox One; the stock will rally some more to $40, then comes the investors conference on Tuesday where msft will disclose further plans for 2014 and beyond; we will get another rally into the rest of next week. We may see low $40's to $45 by the end of next week. $125 by July is very aggressive; I have 9k shares-- it would an injustice for me to make that much money in such a short time. But I do think Msft will hit $75 by xmas. And I promised myself already, if msft does not reach $50 by xmas; I will stop investing forever.</Msg><Username>microsoftd1ck</Username><Timestamp>1369892070376</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 01:34:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369895279769-4</Id><Topic><Title>loving the WEATHER when it rains MONEY!!</Title><Username>bobmarleyyy335</Username><Timestamp>1369807338780</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 02:02:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow they must have made you allot of money by now and this is all free wow</Msg><Username>million.trader</Username><Timestamp>1369895279769</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 02:27:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369895354065-5</Id><Topic><Title>loving the WEATHER when it rains MONEY!!</Title><Username>millionairei</Username><Timestamp>1369782004645</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 19:00:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>im gonna loook them up RIGHT now</Msg><Username>million.trader</Username><Timestamp>1369895354065</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 02:29:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369897218619-6</Id><Title>It is a joke, that Yelp has the 50-fold market-cap and Tumblr the 27-fold price of Local Corp, but both less US-Monthly-Unique-Visitors (newest numbers from Siteanalytics)</Title><Msg>Local Corp (market-cap of 40 million) development of Unique Visitors: 11/2012: 18,745,842 Monthly Unique Visitors 12/2012: 22,738,206 Monthly Unique Visitors 01/2013: 26,410,927 Monthly Unique Visitors 02/2013: 24,017,605 Monthly Unique Visitors 03/2013: 24,427,755 Monthly Unique Visitors 04/2013: 23,785,928 Monthly Unique Visitors Compare with the development of Yelp's (market-cap of 2 billion) Unique Visitors: 11/2012: 19,358,705 Monthly Unique Visitors 12/2012: 21,017,483 Monthly Unique Visitors 01/2013: 22,293,301 Monthly Unique Visitors 02/2013: 21,063,155 Monthly Unique Visitors 03/2013: 23,364,095 Monthly Unique Visitors 04/2013: 22,252,993 Monthly Unique Visitors Compare with the development of Tumblr’s (offer of Yahoo of 1.1 billion) Unique Visitors: 11/2012: 24,610,970 Monthly Unique Visitors 12/2012: 26,348,660 Monthly Unique Visitors 01/2013: 26,003,223 Monthly Unique Visitors 02/2013: 24,082,558 Monthly Unique Visitors 03/2013: 22,990,413 Monthly Unique Visitors 04/2013: 23,21,082 Monthly Unique Visitors</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1369897218619</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 03:00:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369897743999-7</Id><Topic><Title>Windoze 8 'sales' barely half as good as Microsoft claims</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368565436336</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 17:03:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I love my Samsung Google Chromebook, running Chrome OS on a Samsung Exynos ARM processor, with no Windows 8 Metro and No WinTel Inside!!!

He never after, during the eight hours when our guys have their lives in danger, he never called the Secretary of Defense, he never calls the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he never calls the CIA Director,” Krauthammer continued. “Who does he call? About five hours in he calls the Secretary of State. And after the phone call she releases a statement essentially about the video and how we denounce any intolerance. It looks as if the only phone call was to construct a cover story at a time when the last two Americans who died were still alive and fighting for their lives.

NEW statistics show an ever-more-startling divergence between the fortunes of the wealthy and everybody else — and the desperate need to address this wrenching problem. Even in a country that sometimes seems inured to income inequality, these takeaways are truly stunning. Multimedia Graphic . Related News Economic Scene: Inequality Undermines Democracy (March 21, 2012) In 2010, as the nation continued to recover from the recession, a dizzying 93 percent of the additional income created in the country that year, compared to 2009 — $288 billion — went to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, those with at least $352,000 in income. That delivered an average single-year pay increase of 11.6 percent to each of these households. Still more astonishing was the extent to which the super rich got rich faster than the merely rich. In 2010, 37 percent of these additional earnings went to just the top 0.01 percent, a teaspoon-size collection of about 15,000 households with average incomes of $23.8 million. These fortunate few saw their incomes rise by 21.5 percent. The bottom 99 percent received a microscopic $80 increase in pay per person in 2010, after adjusting for inflation. The top 1 percent, whose average income is $1,019,089, had an 11.6 percent increase in income.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1369915925664</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 08:12:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369915926663-25</Id><Title>I agree with this</Title><Msg>http://www.marketwatch.com/story/is-the-pc-the-tech-industrys-next-dinosaur-2013-05-30?siteid=yhoof2 PCs will phase out but not for at least another decade or 2.</Msg><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1369915926663</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 08:12:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369916014055-26</Id><Topic><Title>Remarkable gainers today, ___RCON___ technology software and services co for oil and gas sector</Title><Username>spaldingtirasue</Username><Timestamp>1369753237053</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 11:00:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Looking good</Msg><Username>sunflowetbeets</Username><Timestamp>1369916014055</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 08:13:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369916052911-27</Id><Topic><Title>Plummeting PC sales expose fiction of Windows 8 numbers</Title><Username>hayzeuschrist</Username><Timestamp>1369797061233</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-28 23:11:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have the Surface with 512gb xd card.

Obama has a 45 percent approval rating and a 49 percent disapproval rating — compared with a 48 percent approval, 45 percent disapproval rating from May 1, according to the Quinnipiac University poll. In particular, Obama plunged among independent voters. Only 37 percent of independents approve of him while 57 percent disapprove, Quinnipiac found. At the start of the month, 42 percent of independents approved and 48 percent disapproved. Nine percent of GOPers approve of Obama, 86 percent disapprove. Among Democrats, 87 percent approve, 8 percent disapprove.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1369920132190</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 09:22:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369920224862-37</Id><Topic><Title>The Bulk Of 500 Million Windows XPs Will Migrate To Windows 8 In Q2/2013....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1369856436984</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-29 15:40:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's the funniest thing I heard all day!

You could do well to take the cue from him. Man chooses to be less influenced by God, maybe yes maybe no, it is a personal matter and no one has seen into everyone's heart. . God never loses influence by definiition. I do know that Obama is a great example of a believer in God, and I admire that in him. Try to get along and stop hating someone based on their race. When you hate, you have chosen to exclude God from your thinking, and lose God's influence. Typical continual hypocrisy from you day and night. Everything yiou say the opposite is true. My life is all about me, don't fence me in is what you preach constantly. When you feel compassion for Trevon Martin, or Obama, or Holder, see tham as people equal to yourself and others, then you are stopping the hate and allowing more influence of God to enter..</Msg><Username>ghosanonon</Username><Timestamp>1369922665011</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 10:04:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369922677000-51</Id><Topic><Title>Buy On All Heather Bellini Dips....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1369230544084</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-22 09:49:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another reminder....

Imagine kung#$%$-ing your friends in a living room without the need for joysticks. Imagine, watching a movie while a separate screen pops up and your friend is skyping you on your 60 inch TV screen. Imagine walking into your house and your voice command your xbox to turn on music and change songs without lifting your finger.

My trading platform presents tic x tic, minute, 5 minute, 15 minute, and any other time frame I want and when a trading opportunity forms, then, and only then, do I call up level2 so I can route my order to the market maker offering the best price. Daytraders usually have 4 time frame charts running on 1 stock so any TA trade that comes along is detected and then trade action is taken by calling up level2. When I call up level2 the decision to trade has already been made. The only thing left is to get the best price and just throwing out a market order is not getting the best price. By routing a order you can usually save .01 going and coming and making 1000's of trades a year, that can add up I will admit there is a possibility of seeing a market maker offering a oddball price, but that will have been detected with RT charts, so why "watch " level2? It won't tell you if a stock is breaking out of a channel or any other TA indicator. I put in simple to you, level2 is used to route your order to the best price offered. Once the trade is confirmed there is no need for level2 until the next trade decision has been reached. I would suggest you lurk a rt chat room for a few years then report back here.</Msg><Username>misterreality14</Username><Timestamp>1369929965483</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 12:06:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369930003289-82</Id><Title>How the Fed rigs the Market under Obama for gullible suc**rs like pepeekook</Title><Msg>The mechanism was put in place by REagan, Obama and Bernanke are openly abusing the mechanism for a non intended purpose, another case of overreach and abuse of power by big government. It's not that far removed from the jobs of the olde "floor specialists" except that they defended at support levels, Bernanke is pumping, then defending the pumped up inflated price. It will explode but the pockets are deep and it will require a trigger to get volume moving. Synopsis There are just four people who control all of the U.S. markets through their use of dangerous and explosive DERIVATIVES. They are risking the assets and retirement funds of all Americans. This group is known among Wall Street as the Plunge Protection Team (PPT). Their "official" INTENDED role was to prevent another 1987 "Black Monday". They have the entire U.S. Treasury at their disposal to manipulate the markets through DERIVATIVES (futures options) [NOTE 100% OF THE GAINS SINCE THE 2009 LOWS HAVE HAPPENED OVERNIGHT, I.E. THE PUMPED FUTURES, that's no coincidence]. They use the assets behind the U.S. Treasury to rig the prices of commodites (gold, currencies, etc.) and stocks. This fraternity comprises of Fed Chairman , the Secretary of the Treasury, and the heads of the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Association. It works closely with all the U.S. exchanges and Wall Street banks, including the largest DERIVATIVE risk holders Citibank and JP Morgan Chase. You see the Fed need not do the direct buying, they are lending to GS at 1/2% that you are paying 3% for. It's crooked, it's corrupt, it's classic Obama. The Fed reports a market profit at the end of the year which it returns to the Treasury, where does a profit come from if they are not trading, pepeekook?</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1369930003289</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 12:06:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369930144394-83</Id><Topic><Title>Folks MSFT is up because the Fed has been pumping them to support the DOW</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1369922509563</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 10:01:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"My trading platform..."

"Key findings from this study include: Vendors that ranked first globally in each product category are: Alcatel-Lucent in Access, Harmonic in VHE, Microsoft in VoD and Middleware, Google/Motorola in Set-Top Boxes and Verimatrix in CP/DRM. In addition to also being global leaders, Verimatrix leads the Content Protection category in four of the six geographic regions, Alcatel-Lucent leads in the Access category in four regions, and Harmonic, is atop the Video Headend category in two regions. Huawei leads in three of the six product categories in the Asia Pacific and is gaining traction in Middle East/Africa — most of the changes taking place in leadership for the IPTV market are happening in these regions. In North America, Google-Motorola is the winner, leading in three categories." So now they lead in two categories, huh? :-D</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1369967214116</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-30 22:26:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369968920975-175</Id><Topic><Title>Sen.
