Developers who expect to get cracking on apps for Windows Phone 8 this summer may be in for a disappointment: not only will the final WP8 SDK not arrive until later this year, but the Preview edition due next week will be available to only a select few. At the Windows Phone Summit event in San Francisco this June, Microsoft was fairly tight-lipped about developer features of WP8, but said that it would have "much more to offer" on the SDK and its related Visual Studio developer tools "later this summer." On Wednesday, Todd Brix, who leads product management for Microsoft's Windows Mobile developer platform, confirmed that a "near-final" SDK would be available for download on September 12 – just not to everyone. Only current Windows Phone developers who already have published apps will be eligible to apply for access, Brix wrote, adding, "But I do want to set your expectations that program access will be limited." Redmond's decision to launch its WP8 developer program with such a closely guarded preview adds to mounting evidence that the final versions of the WP8 developer tools won't be available until October – or even later – and quite possibly not until after the first WP8 handsets go on sale.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347015789813</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 07:03:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347018033585-10</Id><Topic><Title>WinBrick 8 preview SDK limited to established developers</Title><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347015789813</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 07:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>developers? guess that leaves you out, S.K.A.N.K.</Msg><Username>tookzgain</Username><Timestamp>1347018033585</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 07:40:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347019765285-11</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan Had a Black Girlfriend</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1346976669366</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:11:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well Craper, this sort of kills your theory that Ryan is racist,, doesn't it????</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1347019765285</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 08:09:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347019827018-12</Id><Topic><Title>WinBrick 8 preview SDK limited to established developers</Title><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347015789813</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 07:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>For windoze it does...no point in wasting time on that POS.

I'm not entirely sure what to say about this excerpt from a Washington Examiner interview other than, "*headdesk*". Mitt Romney: I do believe in basic science. I believe in participating in space. I believe in analysis of new sources of energy. I believe in laboratories, looking at ways to conduct electricity with -- with cold fusion, if we can come up with it. It was the University of Utah that solved that. We somehow can’t figure out how to duplicate it. I'm putting the entire quote after the jump, so you can get the full context of where this came from. It is worth noting that Romney seems to be referring to the 1989 experiments done by Stanley Pons (who worked for the University of Utah) and Martin Fleischmann. If you've ever dug into that particular bit of history, you'll find it sounds a lot like the arsenic life story from 2010—scientists announce huge news by press conference (in the case of Fleischmann and Pons the press conference happened before the research had even been through peer review); media goes apeshit; other scientists try to replicate the results and the vast majority fail miserably; finally, it eventually becomes clear that the researchers made some big errors in their data analysis and the original conclusions turn out to be incorrect.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347028025822</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 10:27:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347028135738-28</Id><Topic><Title>WinBrick 8 preview SDK limited to established developers</Title><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347015789813</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 07:03:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wotopimp- where you been hiding-If you were able to hold a tech job I would bet you were wanting that SDK like phands so you could get busy on new malware- but even the malware boys have to have some talent</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1347028135738</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 10:28:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347028140533-29</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat Freak Show</Title><Username>reasonableme53</Username><Timestamp>1346978933862</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:48:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poll: Romney up 3 in Ohio, best showing since June By Justin Sink - 09/05/12 08:25 PM ET Mitt Romney has opened a 3-point lead in the pivotal swing state of Ohio, according to a new poll released Wednesday — the Republican nominee's best showing since June. The Republican ticket garnered support of 47 percent of those surveyed, versus 43 percent for Democrats, according to a poll released by Gravis Marketing. President Obama has led consistently in the polls since June, although that lead has been usually within the margin of error. Meanwhile, 10 percent of voters remain unsure in the pivotal contest, or say they would back a third-party candidate. Ohio's 18 electoral votes are considered pivotal to both campaigns; no Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio. As in other states, a significant gender gap is apparent in the Ohio electorate. Obama leads Mitt Romney 46 to 43 percent among women, while Romney leads 50 to 41 percent among men. The Democrats are the favored choice of the 18- to 29-year-old demographic but trail substantially among voters 30-49 percent. Those over 50 favor the Republican ticket by a single percentage point. The poll also found the slimmest of leads for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who holds a lead of just fractions of 1 percent over incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). The virtual tie matches Brown's best showing in polls to date; Mandel has never led by more than a percentage point in a public head-to-head poll.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347028140533</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 10:29:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347028310216-30</Id><Topic><Title>Democrat Freak Show</Title><Username>reasonableme53</Username><Timestamp>1346978933862</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-06 20:48:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>steve you should get yosef some eddycashun- there arent any commies left on the planet.

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama laid claim to a peace dividend that doesn't exist when he told the nation he wants to use money saved by ending wars to build highways, schools and bridges. The wars were largely financed by borrowing, so there is no ready pile of cash to be diverted to anything else. The claim was one of several by Obama in his acceptance speech Thursday at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., and by Vice President Joe Biden in earlier remarks that did not match the facts. A look at some of their assertions: OBAMA: "I'll use the money we're no longer spending on war to pay down our debt and put more people back to work - rebuilding roads and bridges, schools and runways. After two wars that have cost us thousands of lives and over a trillion dollars, it's time to do some nation-building right here at home." (AP) Vice President Joe Biden speaks to delegates at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte,... Full Image THE FACTS: The idea of taking war savings to pay for other programs is budgetary sleight of hand, given that the wars were paid for with increased debt. Obama can essentially "pay down our debt," as he said, by borrowing less now that war is ending. But he still must borrow to do the "extra nation-building" he envisions. He made a similar statement in his State of the Union address, and it is no less misleading now than in January. And the savings appear to be based at least in part on inflated war spending estimates for future years. --- OBAMA: "We will reform and strengthen Medicare for the long haul, but we'll do it by reducing the cost of health care, not by asking seniors to pay thousands of dollars more." THE FACTS: Some of the proposals the Obama administration has floated in budget negotiations with Congress would ask Medicare beneficiaries to pay more. Among them: revamping co-payments and deductibles in ways that could raise costs for retirees and increasing premiums for certain beneficiaries. Obama even indicated a willingness to consider raising the eligibility age, currently 65, to 67. As word of some of the proposals leaked out, the president faced a backlash from fellow Democrats. He has since said he would not accept Medicare cuts as a part of a deficit reduction deal, unless it also includes higher taxes on the wealthy. Still, some level of increased costs for middle-class and upper-income Medicare recipients is likely to be part of any future deficit reduction deal.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347029196590</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 10:46:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347029278056-36</Id><Topic><Title>#$%$ moron Romney believes in cold fusion!</Title><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347028025822</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 10:27:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The main hallmark of modern republicanism is anti intellectualism which is required by one of their main constituents - the uneducated evangelicals that seem to control the party.

Alan Krueger, chairman for the White House Council of Economic Advisers, writes in The White House Blog that it is “important to not read too much into a jobs report'. “While there is more work that remains to be done, today’s employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to recover well from the worst downturn since the Great Depression,” Krueger explained. “It is critical that we continue the policies that are building an economy that works for the middle class as we dig our way out of the deep hole that was caused by the severe recession that began in December 2007.” The unemployment rate fell from 8.3 to 8.1 percent, only because 368,000 people gave up looking for a job. Alan said to ignore this group. Employers only added 96,000 jobs last month, despite analysts predicting some 125,000. The government also said Friday that 41,000 fewer jobs were created in July and June than first estimated. The economy has added just 139,000 jobs a month since the start of the year, below 2011′s average of 153,000. Friday’s report was discouraging throughout. Hourly pay fell, manufacturers cut the most jobs in two years and the number of people in the work force dropped to its lowest level in 31 years. “This weak jobs report is going to feed into (the Fed’s) argument that the economy is growing at a sub-par pace,” said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1347041965971</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 14:19:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347042335210-56</Id><Title>The Communist Party is still for Obama</Title><Msg>This may be all he needs to win.</Msg><Username>tomuch2491</Username><Timestamp>1347042335210</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 14:25:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347042475845-57</Id><Title>Barrack: "The greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American public" Clint Eastwood</Title><Msg>The Obamanure Hoax</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1347042475845</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 14:27:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347042596149-58</Id><Title>Barrack lost election yesterday: by larger margin as of today!</Title><Msg>!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1347042596149</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 14:29:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347043947649-59</Id><Title>Politicians Who Deny Climate Change Cannot Be Pro-Business</Title><Msg>Politicians Who Deny Climate Change Cannot Be Pro-Business By Andrew Winston Sep 7, 2012 10:46 AM CT Bloomberg It finally seems to be dawning on many Americans that there's something to this climate change thing. The historic drought has been hard to ignore. While belief in a long-term trend because it's hot out right now is a bit ridiculous, it's a start. You can see a shift in how the media covers weather. The statement "because of climate change..." is often stated clearly without caveats such as, "what some scientists think may be a warming planet." You see it in the UN calling for action to help the hungry cope with rising food prices "in an age of increasing population, demand and climate change." And you see it in the growing number of mega-corporations — including America's Alcoa, Coca-Cola, Cisco, HP, J&amp;J, Nike, and P&amp;G — signing on to the "2 Degree Challenge Communiqué," a call for the world's governments to take strong action to slow greenhouse gas emissions.</Msg><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1347043947649</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 14:52:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347044297142-60</Id><Topic><Title>Funny, some people want to know who Romney is?????</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1347034588036</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 12:16:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your passions are the not with Romney, they are with the rest of the republican parties passion for only bashing against Obama..

Fingerprint-reading software preinstalled on laptops sold by Dell, Sony, and at least 14 other PC makers contains a serious weakness that makes it trivial for hackers with physical control of the machine to quickly recover account passwords, security researchers said. The UPEK Protector Suite, which was acquired by Melbourne, Florida-based Authentec two years ago, is marketed as a secure means for logging into Windows computers using an owner's unique fingerprint, rather than a user-memorized password. In reality, using the software makes users less secure than they otherwise would be. When activated, the software writes Windows account passwords to the registry and encrypts them with a key that is easy for hackers to retrieve. Once the key has been acquired, it takes seconds to decrypt the password. "After analyzing a number of laptops equipped with UPEK fingerprint readers and running UPEK Protector Suite, we found that your Windows account passwords are stored in Windows registry almost in plain text, barely scrambled but not encrypted," said an advisory issued by Elcomsoft, a Russia-based developer of password-cracking software. "Having physical access to a laptop running UPEK Protector Suite, we could extract passwords to all user accounts with fingerprint-enabled logon." When Protector Suite isn't activated, Windows doesn't store account passwords in the registry unless users have specifically configured an account to automatically log in. Security experts have long counseled people not to use automatic login. That means computers that use the UPEK app are at a severe disadvantage compared with people who use a strong password to log in to a Windows account. The most obvious disadvantage is for those computers that have a Windows feature known as Encrypting File System enabled to prevent third parties from accessing sensitive files or folders. The key that unlocks that encrypted data is controlled by a Windows account password. Once the password is retrieved, the EFS-encrypted data stored on the computer can quickly be decrypted. Further, having quick access to the account password could unlock other data that might otherwise be harder to obtain. The Windows Data Protection application programming interface, for example, is also closely tied to account passwords and controls access to credentials used by Outlook, Internet Explorer, and possibly other applications.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347053734227</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 17:35:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347054252991-71</Id><Topic><Title>Widely used fingerprint reader exposes Windoze passwords in seconds</Title><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347053734227</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 17:35:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So who cares you ignorant Microsoft hater and basher Passwords have been under attack by various methosds since the dawn of the computer age and there is nothing new about the latest threat to be ballyhooed by the Dublin Docks Dumbell.

You're right, it's not the Government that's bad, it's the evill venomous blood thirsty anti American pos Musllim Obama that's bad.

In it, the Ohio Democrat accuses Mandel of using the “big lie” strategy in his campaign. The term “big lie” was coined by Adolf Hitler and is commonly associated with Nazi propaganda. Mandel is Jewish. The ad states: “Josh Mandel: He has become the candidate of the big lie.” It cites a Columbus Dispatch columnist as the source for the quote. It argues that Mandel has made numerous false statements about his career as state treasurer, among other distortions. Brown’s ad does not specifically mention Nazis, but the term “big lie” is still closely identified with them. Earlier this week, John Burton, chairman of the California delegation to the Democrats’ Charlotte convention, was criticized when he compared Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Paul Ryan to the Nazis and referenced the “big lie.” “They lie and they don’t care if people think they lie. Joseph Goebbels. It’s the big lie, you keep repeating it,” Burton told the San Francisco Chronicle. He reiterated the point in an interview with ABC: “If you’re not telling the truth, you’re lying. Joseph Goebbels’ concept was the big lie. If you tell it enough, people will think it’s the truth.” Goebbels was Hitler’s minister of propaganda. This is not the first time Brown has linked his opponents to Nazis. In March 2011 he publicly apologized after comparing Republican governors pushing union reforms to Hitler and Stalin in a speech on the Senate floor:</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347067665319</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-07 21:27:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347068303744-102</Id><Title>If you want to know just how devastatingly bad the UE numbers are</Title><Msg>.... just imagine they were this high under GWB's term.
