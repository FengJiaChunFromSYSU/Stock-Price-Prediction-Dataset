MSFt has way more money in the bank, and it also has triple AAA credit rating, and most importantly, MSFt will make $5-8 billions of net profit each and every quater, regardless of the economy or anything else. Remember, MSFt makes the most amount of money from Offcie and Servers and Tools, and these two divisions are growing nicely. Windows phones are picking up steam. MSFt will slowly and surely get into harwares in a big way, so that it can increse windows total profitability, like APple has down to Imac and Ipads and so on. INtc is losing the batter in chips since it cannot supply low powered chips like ARM chips. The single fact that Win RT is going to branching out quickly can cauise a fetal blow to INTC, making intc sacred as hell. MSFt on the other hand is sound, unlike other PC makers. SO, in summary, MSFt should on one hand pushing Win RT systems, and on the other hand buying the shares back like crasy when it is selling at a effective p/e of 5. Dividends cis not as effective as cuttign down the numbers of shares by 10-20%.</Msg><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1354972904667</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 08:21:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354973527830-11</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft may issue $2-3 special dividend ??</Title><Username>meimine</Username><Timestamp>1354909384410</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 14:43:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>almsot 70 billions of cah in the bank, and this cash is gwoing by some 20-30 billions each year, and MFT does not need much money, and it is not a caital intensive industry, so surely they should look into either or both special dividend and stock buy back. What is the fun of lettign 70 billions sitting somewhere making close to 1%, other than helping the US government financing its debts? I would help the shareholders first and most, and most employees are also shareholders. Based on MSft histry, MSFt has always distributed its pile of cash to shareholders either by special dividened and stock buyback. At this point, when the shares are trading like dirt, it is way smarter to buy the shares for cancelleation. Once shares are trading higher than 33, then back to dividend.</Msg><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1354973527830</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 08:32:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354973552169-12</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 - one word SUX</Title><Username>sun_cruise</Username><Timestamp>1354919436376</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 17:30:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will not criticize you as a basher even though you are complaining about something as simple as shutting the PC off.

The unemployment benefits that will be lost will primarily be people's who voted for Obama. The tax increases will be on EVERYBODY - so if you voted for Obama and a chunk of your check is missing in January then remember that you wanted more government. Obama keeps talking about paying their "fair share" when most of the people who voted for him either pay nothing or receive tax money instead of paying it. Hopefully more of them will be paying something now. They get the same benefits from the government that everyone else gets - roads, bridges, defense, etc - even more since they receive welfare, etc - yet he talks about how "rich" people and "everyone" needs to pay their fair share. NOBODY's fair share is zero - or sub-zero. Hopefully going over the fiscal cliff will fix that. Let's go. Let's run it over the cliff.
