This complaint focuses on Microsoft’s Windows 8 “certified PC” feature UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) Secure Boot, which has been described by the group as an “obstruction mechanism”.

Its legal significance arises from theories of marriage as having the purpose of producing legally recognized descendants of the partners, or of providing sanction to their sexual acts together, or both, and amounts to treating a marriage ceremony as falling short of completing the creation of the state of being married. Thus in some Western traditions, a marriage is not considered a binding contract until and unless it has been consummated.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1364323457571</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 14:44:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364323499509-43</Id><Topic><Title>A few years from now 99.9 % of the population will refer to gays as married, but</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1364301500402</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 08:38:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes with time MOST people will consider them married.

The users are correct. PC's with Windows 8 come with the UEFI's Secure Boot enabled by default and one cannot boot another OS unless the maker of the other OS incorporates certificates produced only by Microsoft. Even if the certificates are provided for free there is no rational argument Microsoft can make for fair and open competition where Microsoft is the sole provider of acceptable certificates. Disabling the UEFI's Secure Boot will allow a non-Microsoft OS to boot but then Windows 8 will no longer boot. It's unfortunate the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice didn't have the intelligence to bring this case earlier.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1364327376770</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-26 15:49:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364328245328-51</Id><Topic><Title>Spending cuts?
