Libertarians also stress the right and the need for perople to stand on their own two feet rather than the duty of others, or government to care for people. The researchers found that libertarians had the most "masculine" psychological profile, while liberals had the most feminine explaining why liberalism appeals more to women. That is why I have always suspected that 80 to 90% of this boards liberals are women.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1348930025286</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-29 10:47:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348930124837-13</Id><Title>Damn political bickering here .

I thought Obamacare was supposed to cut costs and make it affordable for all? What should have been done was find ways to cut cost first, them make everyone get coverage. Let's keep the borders open so that every last Mexican that needs healthcare can get it. Especially in bankrupted California. First the American taxpayer is responsible for healthcare for every citizen legal or otherwise, then every illegal that finds itself on our soil. Next, the UN wants money from us for the rest of the world. You liberals are so naive and don't have a clue about money.
