No racism there. Obama not born where his records show?not smart? uses too much the plane? goes places when he should stay home? liver lips? trogladyte? not American? arab? muslim? food stamp president? never seen anywhere by any one? no school records? said he was born in kenya? born in kenya? who is he? never went to college? not a Christian? not born in America? no dignity? community organizer as his top job? got bad grades that were changed to good because he is black? affirmative action got him into harvard not his smarts? There are many more. Racist remarks because they degrade the man not from fact but from who he is. Saying someone is old white male and fat isn't racist at all. Having certified multiple proofs of his American birth, when such proof has never been asked before, no one asked romney, "you know where I was born," did they? what is that from? How degrading is that to do to a man? Just as one example of the many others.That is a big reason you lost. Racism against Obama was blatant and open, still is. Some still say he wasn't born in America. Some think he lies all the time, because you know,that's what they do. I never heard Obama lie once, a most honest and genuine man he is.

Firms can no longer use the joke of security the evil empire's failed attempts at writing an os represent. They will have no other choice then move email, and other sensitive data rich applications to more secure unix/linux/cloud based platforms. By way of an example of how #$%$ poor the 3rd world hacks that fuel blammer's cost save bonus are in the area of security there's a firm in portland that tracks online gaming fraud how by writing an id to your hard drive. It took them only 20 minutes when the 7th failed attempt at an os came out to hack the hard drive. Most telling every startup created by former evil empire employees has had to admit the lack of security in evilware caused them to move to other vendors offerings. From the recent chart action the mkt is getting wise that it's game over for the evil empire and stories that blammer's days maybe numbered are everywhere.</Msg><Username>shortinfygetrich</Username><Timestamp>1355069846931</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 11:17:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355070639202-34</Id><Topic><Title>surface pro will rock on corporate network</Title><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1354897854091</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 11:30:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Waiting here to buy the Surface Pro . both worlds in one machine</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1355070639202</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 11:30:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355070989791-35</Id><Topic><Title>PC sales down 21%, MSFT Windows &amp; Office sales will be down 21%</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1354854501497</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 23:28:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bwu106, exactly right. MS not a player at all in Tablets. They were a bit player in phones. Win 8 story more about those areas then about PC. They have a lot of market to grab. Desktop is a mature market. Tablets and Smartphones are bigger growth area so MSFT going after these areas. Win8 was made for those devices. Tablets will work. Expect to see more Win8 tablets in the market. Windows phones flying off the shelf. People are getting bored with iPhone. AAPL doing nothing with that platform except minor improvements.</Msg><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1355070989791</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 11:36:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355073314264-36</Id><Topic><Title>PC sales down 21%, MSFT Windows &amp; Office sales will be down 21%</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1354854501497</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 23:28:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't Ballmer the real problem?

That 21% was US sales and dragged down worldwide sales which were down less (in a worldwide down economy), and there could have a seldom mentioned reason for US sales being down. In 2011 in the US, I heard, there was a very good investment tax incentive to buy PC's in that year. Like many programs over the last number of years, it robbed sales from the future. Couple that with an foreseen upcoming launch of Win8, worldwide weak economies and I could see a fall off ... at least it is a consideration. And it is not surprising that people spend their "rationed money" on phones and tablets when those are the things they may not have already, and are the hype. MSFT has just now started to be in that game. The Win8 launch over all platforms is going to be drawn out, and the launch almost seemed convoluted, but I don't know how that could have been avoided unless MSFT just delayed the launch. INTC will eventually get their chips for tablets and phones out with LTE ... and the many manufacturers will eventually offer the new products. It's just going to be drawn out. Plenty of time for bashing and hype. Both sides can have their fun. But MSFT has started to unfold things and others have a new competitor ... we'll see how the future unfolds. I could see the BYOW starting to weaken over the next few years.</Msg><Username>wgrsh</Username><Timestamp>1355078551962</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 13:42:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355078649823-55</Id><Topic><Title>Can you use the Laplace transform to solve nonlinear differential equations ??</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1355016995616</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 20:36:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YUP but most have satisfactory solutions with a hybrid linear algebra approach for engineering and scientific applications wikisDOTlibDOTncsuDOTedu/indexDOTphp/Laplace_Transforms</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1355078649823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-09 13:44:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355079481841-56</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 - one word SUX</Title><Username>sun_cruise</Username><Timestamp>1354919436376</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 17:30:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fix??

MSFT paying dividened at 3.5, and effective p/e just 5, so issuing more debt to buy back is simply a very smart thing to do, if have to. The current stock buyback, announced eyars ago, still have some 5 billions left to be completeted. For some reason, MSFt has not done much of buying back over the last year or so. However, cash at hand have incresed by some 30 billions over the last year or so, so now, MSFT is in very strong position to launch massive buybacks, if market considition is faverable.
