Google it. Quoting: "By Aabha Rathee | More Articles January 27, 2013 Page 1 of 3 "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finished the week at 52-week lows after failing to “wow” Wall Street. Revenue increased 18 percent to $54.51 billion and net income came in $13.07 billion, up from $13.06 billion a year earlier. "Although Apple announced the highest revenues in company history and the fourth most profitable quarter of any company in history, this week’s earnings were the first time in several years Apple has not posted a double-digit earnings increase year-over-year. "The prospects of slowed growth are making investors panic and have led to a late week selloff. Moreover, the S&amp;P and Nasdaq are heavily weighted toward Apple, so Apple’s future will ultimately impact the strength of the current market rally. "Some insist the latest numbers point to the fact that Apple is now a value stock instead of a growth monster. In short, many analysts are asking whether Apple is headed down Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) path."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1359291500734</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-27 07:58:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359295136431-3</Id><Title>Sueface Computers are now heading to Cosco</Title><Msg>News just out.

(2353), the Taiwanese computer maker that’s suffered two consecutive annual losses, posted “amazing” sales of notebooks using Google Inc. (GOOG)’s Chrome platform after the release of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)’s Windows 8 failed to ignite the market. Chrome-based models accounted for 5 percent to 10 percent of Acer’s U.S. shipments since being released there in November, President Jim Wong said in an interview at the Taipei-based company’s headquarters. That ratio is expected to be sustainable in the long term and the company is considering offering Chrome models in other developed markets, he said. Enlarge image Jim Wong, president of of Acer Inc. Photographer: Maurice Tsai/Bloomberg Enlarge image Jim Wong, president of Acer Inc. Photographer: Maurice Tsai/Bloomberg Acer, which last week announced a NT$3.5 billion ($120 million) write-off on the value of its Gateway, Packard Bell and eMachines brands that pushed it into losses, is looking for alternatives as Windows-based computers struggle amid rising popularity of tablets and smartphones.
