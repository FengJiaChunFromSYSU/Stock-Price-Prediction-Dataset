It is not a coincidence that each and every one of the aliases supporting Obama is grossly uninformed. Google it, it's Clinton explaining why he didn't take Osama. The number of times he declined is in dispute as to 6 to 8. He also reveals why. He said he asked the Saudis to take him but he was too much of a "hot potato" which is also why Clinton didn't take him, he was too involved with skirt chasing to deal with the fallout.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1370084709491</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-01 07:05:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370084737659-13</Id><Title>Nokia getting Microsoft XBOX One EXCLUSIVES?

All was best effort at the time, and all the Presidents love their country. Now we have Obama, who is on the ball, and in short order he has cleaned up OBL, and it was due directly to his leadership and decisions in the matter. That's the facts and that's it. Good for him, he should take more credit, but the kind of man he is, he credits others first.

Anyway, Clinton, or Obama for that matter, could have killed bin Ladin anytime he wanted - they had an entire fleet of UN black helicopters at his disposal for secret missions.... By the way, in 1998 Clinton did fire a cruise missile at a camp for the express purpose of trying to kill bin Ladin - that's public record, part of the 9/11 Commission Report, undisputed by any respected official, Republican or Democrat. Clinton fired a cruise missile at bin Ladin in the effort to kill him. What did George Bush do?

There is no way to relive because you don't have all the information. The FBI was involved, said there was no way to hold him on evidence, no grounds to hold him, etc. Clinton wasn't a King. Your theories are faulty. Another thing on fact check is called "whig history" which is asking why things in he past weren't dne basd on what happened later. The example they give is asking "why didn’t someone just shoot Hitler in 1930?" Of course no one knew the futire yet is why. What DID happen is Pres Obama directly caused OBL to be punished, and that is the end of it.

Recession had also led companies to put back renewal of their PCs, IDC said. The firm’s vice president, Bob O’Donnell, said: “Unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only didn’t provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market.” Windows 8 is designed to work well with touch-sensitive screens, but the displays add to the cost of a PC. Together, the changes and higher prices “have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices,” Mr O’Donnell said.
