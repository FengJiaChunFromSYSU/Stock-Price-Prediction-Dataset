Men represent less that 0.000005% of the USA. There are only a few thousand million men here, the rest (the other 300 million) are either gay, or are beasts--call buying, alcoholic, drug addicted, swearing, fat, lying, molesting, beasts of the satanic forests. Who would be able to vote if it weren't for the women in this country? God's definition of MAN is not the definition of these beasts in the current days; therefore, one can only logically surmise that, since God's definition of MAN is not met, then there are in fact NO MEN here, or VERY few. God gave women, from the beginning, a one-upmanship position. For one thing, God's definition of women was never that great to begin with so women don't have a lot to live up to. It is because of this, by technical default they have now surpassed men. Men failed to live up to the high definition, became monsters, and sunk into the depths, and because of logic women gained the advantage. You must live up to God's definition of MAN before you can reap the benefits of what God wanted.</Msg><Username>w0065jane</Username><Timestamp>1373295755221</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 11:02:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1373295777366-29</Id><Title>Xbox One Designed With Advertising in Mind</Title><Msg>Google it.

That's right, the government's sweeping surveillance of our most private communications excludes the jihad factories where homegrown terrorists are radicalized. Since October 2011, mosques have been off-limits to FBI agents. No more surveillance or undercover string operations without high-level approval from a special oversight body at the Justice Department dubbed the Sensitive Operations Review Committee. Who makes up this body, and how do they decide requests? Nobody knows; the names of the chairman, members and staff are kept secret. We do know the panel was set up under pressure from Islamist groups who complained about FBI stings at mosques.

Your Right-Wing Stuff ALL comes from an IBD Opinion Piece ... "Investors Business Daily has an incredibly inflammatory article taking advantage of the recent uproar about the NSA’s broad spying programs to assert that Muslims are being given a special exemption from government eavesdropping. The claim is incredibly similar to a right-wing myth spread about a supposed “Muslim exception” from TSA screenings that happened to pop up at the same time as the TSA’s “enhanced pat-down” provoked a media firestorm and popular outrage." However: "Here is the FBI’s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide from October 2011, p. 171:" "A sensitive investigative matter (SIM) is defined as an investigative matter involving the activities of a domestic public official or domestic political candidate (involving corruption or a threat to the national security), a religious or domestic political organization or individual prominent in such an organization, or the news media; an investigative matter having an academic nexus; or any other matter which, in the judgment of the official authorizing the investigation, should be brought to the attention of FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) and other DOJ officials." --- Here is where The Editorial (Opinion) Is DEBUNKED: "there are certain investigations which are considered more “sensitive” than others and this includes investigations of Islamic groups. But here’s the thing: this also applies to all religious and political groups as well as the news media and academic institutions. So the FBI would most likely face the same hurdles investigating a Christian church or a Jewish synagogue as it would in investigating a mosque." Did you read that ?

First this ... did the article give you a reference to check out ? FBI’s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide from October 2011, p. 171 Did you validate it ? Here Stooge from another article .... "Is Obama giving mosques a special exemption from surveillance? - Posted on Thu, 13 Jun 2013 " "Hilariously, the IBD editorial makes it sound as if the Sensitive Operations Review Committee was a recent creation of the Obama administration “set up under pressure from Islamist groups who complained about FBI stings at mosques.” Yet the name of the committee also appears in the 2008 FBI domestic operations guide as well, meaning it was either created under Bush or an earlier administration." "It is doubtful that the IBD allegation contains even a shred of truth. The publication has previously made the false assertion that Obama offered to apologize for the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (as if that would be a bad thing!) based on a willful misreading of a Wikileaks cable. " "Predictably, the ludicrous idea that Muslims are exempt from the Obama administration’s numerous spying programs is now catching on in the right-wing puke funnel.

"The economy lost 8.7 million jobs as a result of the 2007-2009 recession, the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Those losses included 4.4 million jobs lost during Bush’s final year, and another 4.3 million during Obama’s first 13 months in office.

Or in lay terms, Obama's total ineptitude means we spent $450,000 for every job created since he took office, all paid for by printed or borrowed money that has real inflation rampant and he still is not close to keeping up with normal population growth, and some fiscal idiots think that is deserving of applause..</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373336472763</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 22:21:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373336611387-120</Id><Topic><Title>500% in profit just this MONTH</Title><Username>stockmr</Username><Timestamp>1368250132474</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 01:28:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thanks for sharing!</Msg><Username>j_benson34</Username><Timestamp>1373336611387</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 22:23:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373336724037-121</Id><Topic><Title>Hawcraper asked for his lie to be identified, it already has but he responds so quickly he doesn't read</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373335570584</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 22:06:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"He claimed a quote came from the FBI, it did not." You have yet to point out that quote out in any of your posts ... So, I'll assume you are LYING. Here is what I posted about the FBI: "Here is the FBI’s Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide from October 2011, p. 171:" "A sensitive investigative matter (SIM) is defined as an investigative matter involving the activities of a domestic public official or domestic political candidate (involving corruption or a threat to the national security), a religious or domestic political organization or individual prominent in such an organization, or the news media; an investigative matter having an academic nexus; or any other matter which, in the judgment of the official authorizing the investigation, should be brought to the attention of FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) and other DOJ officials." ----- Here is where The Editorial (Opinion) Is DEBUNKED: "there are certain investigations which are considered more “sensitive” than others and this includes investigations of Islamic groups. But here’s the thing: this also applies to all religious and political groups as well as the news media and academic institutions. So the FBI would most likely face the same hurdles investigating a Christian church or a Jewish synagogue as it would in investigating a mosque." Did you read that ? "all religious and political groups as well as the news media and academic institutions." ----- Now, to prove you are not Lying ... point out the Quote that I said was from the FBI ... If you can't do that ... then consider yourself a LIAR.</Msg><Username>hawcreeks_world</Username><Timestamp>1373336724037</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 22:25:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373336884669-122</Id><Topic><Title>More Americans on federal food assistance than work in the private sector, thanks, Obama</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373335307482</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-07-08 22:01:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Or in lay terms" That means Obama has Reversed the Bush Financial Disaster and Great Recession.
