So, once again, I urge everyone to view that video. It is amazing and tells the hard truth about Obama's support for infanticide. It will be appear on TV in many states in the near future. Here is the text of the ad: Ohden: I was aborted, and my body discarded...like I didn't exist. But a nurse heard me crying...and cared enough to save my life. There's something else you may not know...when he was in the Illinois State Senate, Barack Obama voted to deny basic constitutional protections for babies born alive from a failed abortion. Not once, but four times. I know that it is by the grace of God I am alive today...if only to ask America this question Is this the kind of leadership that will move us forward?

The surprise announcement at an electronics show in Berlin came a week before Nokia, which has a close partnership with Microsoft, is due to unveil its new Lumia smartphones in New York. A U.S. federal jury found last week that Samsung had copied critical features of the iPhone and awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages. The decision led to speculation that Samsung and other handset makers using Google Inc's Android system would be drawn toward Microsoft's phone software, which Apple has not targeted with any patent complaints. "This is just the first in a big lineup of new hardware that's coming with Windows Phone 8, but it's a seriously impressive opening salvo," wrote Microsoft executive Ben Rudolph on a company blog showing off the new phone, called the ATIV S. Microsoft gave a preview of its new phone software, called Windows Phone 8, in June, and promised the first phones would be on the market by the autumn [ID:nL1E8HK8OK]. Windows Phone 8 looks similar to, and is built on the same core code as Microsoft's upcoming Windows 8 operating system, but is not the same product. Windows 8, which will run on tablets and PCs, is scheduled to launch on October 26.</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1346269914605</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 15:51:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346269997730-36</Id><Title>Why not move up more?</Title><Msg>Why isn't Mr. Softee moving up on the potential of migration away from Android and to Windows, in the phone marketplace, given Apple's win in court and today's announcement by Samsung showing the migration has begun?</Msg><Username>apertain</Username><Timestamp>1346269997730</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 15:53:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346274440176-37</Id><Title>Yhoo Bureau Chief fired for racist remarks</Title><Msg>story is everywhere except Yhoo.</Msg><Username>kkness1</Username><Timestamp>1346274440176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 17:07:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346275663054-38</Id><Topic><Title>A quote of the 20th century that Bama loves!</Title><Username>dogeater2012</Username><Timestamp>1346202349066</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 21:05:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We knew all politicians lie.

It was the deadliest single loss for U.S. forces in the decade-long war in Afghanistan. 17 members of the elite Navy SEALs were killed in the crash. Yesterday, Karen and Billy Vaughn, parents of Aaron Carson Vaughn, spoke at the Defending the Defenders forum sponsored by the Tea Party Patriots outside the RNC Convention in Tampa. Karen brought a copy of the form letter they were sent following their sonâs death. Itâs a form letter. It was signed by an electric pen. Thatâs not all. Karen Vaughn reached out to the parents of the other SEALs killed in that crash. Their letters were all the same. Form letters â signed by an electric pen. Hereâs a closer look at the letter sent to the parents of Chief Petty Officer Nicholas H. Null. Itâs the same form letter. After the deadliest single loss of US forces in Afghanistan, Barack Obama sent out form letters to the parents.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1346286797917</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:33:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346287444728-52</Id><Title>What day does the Obamanure Fest start next week?</Title><Msg>Anyone know?????</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346287444728</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:44:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346287500984-53</Id><Title>I actually meant the Obamanure Convention</Title><Msg>What day next week?</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346287500984</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:45:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346287592968-54</Id><Title>Poll: How many tons of Obamanure will be shoveled next week?</Title><Msg>I say about 2 tons per day!</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346287592968</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:46:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346287895313-55</Id><Title>What state is the Obamanure Convention held in?</Title><Msg>?????????</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346287895313</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:51:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346288096246-56</Id><Title>MSFT only worth 40% of Apple</Title><Msg>That must make Ballmer feel very successful!</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346288096246</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:54:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346288230337-57</Id><Title>Remember that onetime $3 dividend?</Title><Msg>$30 12 years ago, $30 now, fantastic growth!</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346288230337</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:57:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346288330832-58</Id><Title>Only one product makes more revenue &amp; profit than all of MSFT!</Title><Msg>iPhone all by itself!</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346288330832</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:58:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346289307555-59</Id><Title>12 years of Growth Stocks</Title><Msg>* MSFT - 42% * Chevron +158% * MMM +89% * Caterpillar +194% * Reynolds Tabacco +912% And great dividends on top of that growth!</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346289307555</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 21:15:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346289421284-60</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone Watching The Republican Convention ???</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1346275368505</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 17:22:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everyone must be, because not even Obamanurists responding to posts!</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346289421284</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 21:17:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346291172785-61</Id><Title>4 years of Obamanure will be over on November 7!</Title><Msg>Well, there will be more Obamanure until January 21.
