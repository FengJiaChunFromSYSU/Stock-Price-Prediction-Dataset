Microsoft has long had a "voice recognition" utility in Windows. I suspect Apple commercials exaggerate the capabilities of Siri. In one, a user asks, "Are you serious?" and Siri answers, "Yes, I am not allowed to be frivolous."

At least Romney didn't do it with taxpayer money. Electric Cars Obama handed over billions of dollars in loan guarantees and stimulus awards pursuant to his goal of putting one-million electric vehicles on the road by 2015. Much of that money ended up leaving our shores. A $2.4 billion stimulus program to support battery production sent nearly half of its money to foreign firms, including two South Korean companies that used their awards to hire foreign nationals in Michigan to do work that Americans easily could have done. In the end, despite all the money Obama handed out, electric vehicle sales have lagged and The Washington Post deemed his goal of one million electric cars "overly optimistic." Wind Farms Obama's stimulus included over $8.5 billion in grants for wind farms that flowed overseas, despite Congressional criticism from both sides of the aisle. In total, over half of the money went to either foreign developers or foreign wind turbine manufacturers, creating thousands of jobs overseas with money that was supposed to create jobs within the United States. Even worse, hundreds of millions of dollars went to wind farms that began construction before the stimulus was passed. The end result of all this spending: the wind energy industry lost 10,000 jobs last year. Manufacturing TaxCredits As Obama was doling out over $2.3 billion in clean energy manufacturing tax credits that were supposed to create jobs in America, $880 million went to foreign firms. Worse still, some of those same recipients are now closing up shop and shipping jobs overseas. Loan Guarantees Remember Solyndra? The problems with Obama's loan guarantee program don't end there. The largest recipient of Obama's program to jumpstart green energy projects was the Spanish Company Abengoa, which took in $2.7 billion in loan guarantees for three of its projects. Other projects importing foreign-made solar panels are, much in the same way as Fisker Automotive, choosing to make their products overseas.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1346003797000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 13:56:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346003810000-39</Id><Topic><Title>Dik &amp; Dubya Conspicuously Absent</Title><Username>onehot_fun_usa</Username><Timestamp>1345995223000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 11:33:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The GOP is running away from the Bush/Ch*n*y legacy as fast as they can.

In that state, 22.8 percent of disability beneficiaries had been diagnosed with a mood disorder. New Hampshire was second with 22.2 percent, and Rhode Island was third with 20.7 percent. In each month since December 2011, SSA has reported, the overall number of Americans collecting disability has continued to rise. In August, according to SSA, a record 8,767,941 American workers collected disability. Also, in addition to the 8,767,941 workers collecting disability payments, there were 1,853,651 eligible children of disabled workers collecting additional benefits and 164,651 eligible spouses of disabled workers collecting benefits—bringing the total number of disability beneficiaries in August to 10,786,510.

Rogers, who for years has been an outspoken critic of the Feds policies of "Quantitative Easing," says the world is "drowning in too much debt." He put the blame squarely on U.S. and European governments for abusing their "license to print money." In the U.S. alone, the national debt has surged to nearly $16 trillion, that's more than $50,000 for every American man, woman and child. "[They] need to stop spending money they don't have," Rogers said. "The solution to too much debt is not more debt... What would make me very excited is if a few people [in the government] went bankrupt..." Rogers added. Rogers also charged Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel with promoting dangerous policies that create the illusion the economy is stable... but are really only intended to buy time before their upcoming elections. Do these charts and graphs prove that the Obama Administration’s current economic path is headed for disaster? "Mrs. Merkle has an election next year," Rogers said. "Mr. Obama has an election in November. The Americans and the Germans - they want to do everything they can to hold the world up until after the next election." "It's going to be bad after the next election." In a newly released documentary that went viral last month, a team of influential economic experts say they have discovered a "frightening pattern" they believe points to a massive economic catastrophe unlike anything ever seen in the history of the world</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1346005186000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 14:19:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346006187000-45</Id><Topic><Title>Of course, this guy is not as smart as Craper</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1346005186000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 14:19:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jim Rodgers????

I know a few people now with 2 &amp; 3 retirement checks.</Msg><Username>willstand99</Username><Timestamp>1346035323000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:42:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346036380000-98</Id><Title>How is dog eater in the polls?</Title><Msg>Does it taste like fried chicken?</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346036380000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 22:59:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346036522000-99</Id><Title>Dog Eater creates foreign jobs with Tax $$$</Title><Msg>Eat dog!!!</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346036522000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 23:02:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346036590000-100</Id><Topic><Title>Who is responsible for outsourcing jobs?</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1346003647000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 13:54:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Dog Eater is responsible!!!</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346036590000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 23:03:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346036643000-101</Id><Topic><Title>I hope the hurricane wipes out the RNC</Title><Username>phands.theheretic2</Username><Timestamp>1346006127000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 14:35:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How is the dog eater doing??????</Msg><Username>obadidosss</Username><Timestamp>1346036643000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 23:04:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346036843000-102</Id><Topic><Title>Looks like hawKKKunt10 got canned.</Title><Username>phands.theheretic2</Username><Timestamp>1345940132000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-25 20:15:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what did he get canned for? there are several as bad or worse, or maybe that was all him as well.

They don't use the word infanticide but they describe what is infanticide ... the deliberate starving and neglect till death of living born babies. That's what Obama voted for and now he lies about it.

Every time you buy a cheap Chinese substitute where an American quality alternate exists, you are sending jobs overseas/ that was started 24 years ago or more but you're right. Go to costco, even that furniture is made in china. vanities, faucets, shoes, tools, most everything in the store except the live plants and food. now there is almost no choice. Go to thrift shops to find your usa made items. There's your loss of manufacturing jobs, and worse, the transfer of know how.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1346038324000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 23:32:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346038881000-107</Id><Topic><Title>LIFE WILL BE EASIER WITH PRESIDENT ROMNEY.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1346020091000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 18:28:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FINALLY, A GENTLEMAN WILL BE IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

Obama is more of a gentleman than Romney, and Michelle more of a lady than Ann, no doubt about that. Just look at the campaign rhetoric for your proof. And if Romney is ever Prsident, the world will be laughing once again that Americans are stupid. Obama is highly regarded world wide as an intellectual, gentleman, and diplomat. He has proved that, nothing can change that.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1346038881000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 23:41:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346039030000-108</Id><Title>keep pinherhands busy guys</Title><Msg>that keeps her off nok board</Msg><Username>tpdarr</Username><Timestamp>1346039030000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 23:43:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346039907000-109</Id><Topic><Title>LIFE WILL BE EASIER WITH PRESIDENT ROMNEY.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1346020091000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-26 18:28:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is highly regarded world wide as an intellectual, gentleman, and diplomat.
