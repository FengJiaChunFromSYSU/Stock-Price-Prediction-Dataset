I believe Windows 8 sales are being constrained by the availability of hardware (in particular, multi-touch monitors). Try to find a PC with a touch monitor (or even a stand alone touch monitor) with current availability. I'm not sure it makes sense to upgrade or buy without multi-touch capability. Once the hardware catches up with the demand, I think Win8 will become a success story.</Msg><Username>go_for_the_gusto</Username><Timestamp>1352899510639</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 08:25:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352900693385-31</Id><Topic><Title>What if we trick the RWNJ to seceding from the union and taking up residence in say Tex #$%$.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1352859335840</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 21:15:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You say they breed like rabbits, yet the idiotic right wing says if they get the power they will do away with family planning, how's that for absolute nuttiness...</Msg><Username>tocrazyright</Username><Timestamp>1352900693385</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 08:44:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352901993155-32</Id><Topic><Title>Win8 limiting factor ...</Title><Username>go_for_the_gusto</Username><Timestamp>1352899510639</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 08:25:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft didn't simply didn't care that there are several billion PC's that will never have touch and they failed to give the OS to ability to offer those users a W7 desktop, even though it would have been very easy to do. Not only is there no reason to upgrade, there are even better reasons not to. Moreover, even new PC's and workstations with large displays aren't usable with touch because people's arms aren't long enough to reach the edge of the display. Simple truth is that Microsoft wanted to push its own "one size fits all" mobile agenda on everyone when all the feedback said tiles interferes with user's productivity except on a tablet or small form factor device with touch. The biggest fear among consumers now is that if they buy a traditional laptop they are forced to endure W8 and some are postponing their purchases. Forcing Microsoft's tiles (and hidden paid ads) on everyone and every device is a classic example of corporate arrogance and the entire team responsible for it deserves to be fired. At least this has begun.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1352901993155</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 09:06:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352903010731-33</Id><Topic><Title>What if we trick the RWNJ to seceding from the union and taking up residence in say Tex #$%$.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1352859335840</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-13 21:15:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The right wing will do away with family planning government funding because it's a waste of money.</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1352903010731</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 09:23:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352903124255-34</Id><Topic><Title>Win8 limiting factor ...</Title><Username>go_for_the_gusto</Username><Timestamp>1352899510639</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 08:25:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Touch screen is for phones, and not PC's.

Profit on the trade of $408 per 100 shares (2 mentions) minus commissions. The stock gapped down today based on the resignation of Sinofsky who is/was the overseer of the Windows 8 that was just released. Windows 8 has met with mixed reviews and it is not likely it will be a big money winner for the company. The stock could, and probably will, head lower. Nonetheless, there are chart reasons to take profits here as the 200-week MA is at 26.55, the stock has a strong breakaway gap between 26.12 and 26.39 and does have a mountain of congestion support between 24.25 and 27.50, meaning that squeezing more profit out of this trade is going to be like pulling teeth. There are other stocks where faster and more secure profits can be generated. I will consider shorting the stock again around the 27.50 level but not for another few days and even then the risk/reward ratio is not going to be great.</Msg><Username>luckyone581</Username><Timestamp>1352915268869</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:47:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352915481137-60</Id><Topic><Title>TADF BIG OCTOBER NEWS.TADF 2000% GAINS POSSIBLE ON ACQUISITIONS ANNOUNCED.

("Northrop"), a military aircraft holding company, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of TADF. Through the acquisition of Northrop, TADF has acquired ownership of a Canadair CF-5 aircraft (the "CF-5"), which TADF intends to use in support of tactical aviation contracts that it is currently pursuing through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AeroTech Corporation. In addition, as previously disclosed in our prior Form 8-K filing, through the pending acquisition of Globalease Corporation ("Globalease"), TADF intends to acquire an additional two Canadair CF-5 aircraft through lease-to-purchase agreements. CF-5 aircraft are supersonic fighter aircraft known to be cost effective, low-maintenance, and extremely versatile fighter jets that have been used effectively by many countries around the world as light attack strike fighters, reconnaissance platforms, and to provide a tactical support role as air-to-ground, close-air-support, training platforms or dissimilar air combat training aircraft. The CF-5 two-seat aircraft are considered by many to be the ideal training aircraft for F-16 lead-in fighter pilot training. (MARKETWIRE via COMTEX) -- Tactical Air Defense Services, Inc. (OTCQB: TADF), an aerospace/defense services contractor that offers tactical aviation services, aircraft maintenance, and other aerospace/defense services to the United States and Foreign militaries, is pleased to announce that it has purchased an F-5 aircraft mission and procedures cockpit training simulator for $250,000, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AeroTech Corporation. The F-5 training device uses a commercial COTS computer system, housed in a specifically fabricated F-5 cockpit, to provide a realistic F-5 flight simulation experience. The F-5 simulator is used to train pilots for basic flight characteristics and for emergency situations, and to complement actual flight time in an F-5 aircraft. TADF is one of only a few commercial companies to own an F-5 aircraft simulator, and is comparable to the two F-5 simulators that were recently sold by L-3 Communications to the U.S. Navy for approximately $3 million each. To see Col. Scott Patterson, Chief Operating Officer of our wholly-owned subsidiary, AeroTech, test "flying" an F-5 simulator prior to our purchase decision, please go to: youtube/watch?v=1N80C-dUDIA.</Msg><Username>underdraderstocks</Username><Timestamp>1352915481137</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:51:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352915538849-61</Id><Topic><Title>*WARNING* USA IS BANKRUPTCY BY YEAR END = MEGA CRASH ON THE WAY</Title><Username>pharmaherobw</Username><Timestamp>1352915417844</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 12:50:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>......and you "just" realized this?

There are tablets with ARM processors and Android operating systems. There are tablets with ARM processors and Windows RT operating systems. There are tablets with Intel Atom processors (at 3 watts) and Android operating systems. There are tablets with Intel Atom processors (at 3 watts) and the full Windows 8 operating system. There are tablets with Intel Ivy Bridge processors (at about 17 watts) and the full Windows 8 operating system. And tablets with Intel Haswell processors (at 10 to 14 watts or so) are planned for the first half of 2013 and these are for the full Windows 8 operating system. But a couple of reviewers have complained about tablets docking to a laptop keyboard as not being rigid. The easy fix is to dock to a desktop station that could be rigid. But see when you undock your tablet and walk out the door with it, you have walked out the door with your main computer. So no one wants a tablet as their main computer but only as their travel computer. The tablet doesn't need a keyboard but only file transfer to the desktop computer. In fact someone needing a keyboard with a travel computer should just get an Ultrabook. Ultrabook ? The Samsung 13.3" Series 9 is 2.6 pounds weight and that's about the best that I can do. As for tablets, pick your own soup but the Lenovo 10.1" ThinkPad 2 with Intel Atom and Windows 8 is about 1.3 pounds. Then the Samsung 11.6" ATIV 500T with Intel Atom and Windows 8 is about 1.6 pounds without the keyboard. But the Samsung has both WiFI and ethernet while the Lenovo certainly has WiFi and then also offers cellular. Other tablets simply spin the tablet around and snap in place to cover the laptop keyboard. But these will always be heavy. In fact when they are very affordable they are about 3.5 pounds weight but they could possibly be 2.5 pounds like the Samsung Series 9 Ultrabook. The Lenovo ThinkPad 2 tablet is scheduled for November 16 while the Samsung ATIV 500T tablet is scheduled for November 20. The Samsung 13.3" Series 9 Ultrabook is currently available with Windows 7.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1352934037247</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 18:00:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352937629484-102</Id><Topic><Title>Did Carl Rove Really Believe Voters Would Vote Against Their Own Interests Again?</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1352919444693</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-14 13:57:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>really? my you are mixed up. do you even know what the fiscal cliff refers to? do you make over 250k agi?
