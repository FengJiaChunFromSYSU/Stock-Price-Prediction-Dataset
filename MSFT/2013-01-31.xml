According to their survey, neither Apple nor Google are currently ranking among the top 20 most trusted companies in America, while Microsoft has made a new appearance on the ranking; for the first time hitting the number 17 spot. Apple was ranked 14th last year, and has now dropped off the list; showing an increasing distrust in the company whose autocratic modus operandi is increasingly disturbing consumers and who has been involved in a number of serious tracking issues. Products such as Apple maps have also not inspired confidence. Similarly, Google who ranked 10th in 2008, 13th in 2010 and 19th in 2011 has also fallen off the list. That company of course whole business model is based on invading consumers privacy, thus making the result unsurprising.

Wal mart is a one way money machine for dollars. Everyone likes the savings as long as some other person loses their job. The money flowed from the middle class to companies that acted as middlemen between Chinese sweat chops and wal mart. The stoppage is not at the investment point, companies have record cash. Small business is not the answer, they are not engines of innovation, at least 99.99% of them are not. Devaluing the dollar is the ONLY fix. I need not remind you that many in the upper class are not in favor of this, hence the political forward operation to push Austerity and drive the country into depression. At this point the only cure is to get money back into the hands of consumers and drive demand. The political theater is about this issue.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1359678757443</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 19:32:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359678845612-76</Id><Title>They have to regroup when challenged, they know the emontional appeal looks bad when</Title><Msg>ideas with evidence is provided.
