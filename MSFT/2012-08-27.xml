His book is full of distrust and dislike for whites. Why is that any difference with a white person's distrust of blacks? Obama, in his rush to judgment, ignored pertinent facts, such as one of the arresting officers is black, the Cambridge Mayor is black and the Massachusetts Governor is black. From his lofty perch as the leader of the free world, Obama focused like a laser beam on the skin color of one man and engaged in grievance mongering about “racial profiling,” a charge that hampers law enforcement in black communities and was not even a factor in the Cambridge case. In an instant, Obama abandoned any pretense of being “post racial” and, before our very eyes, was transformed into our “race-baiter-in-chief”. Today, Obama is changing the Democratic Party into a party with the sinister premise that America is a black man’s country and the black men must govern it. Perhaps this is why Obama refused to prosecute Black Panthers who wielded weapons, hurled racial insults at voters and blocked the entrance at a Philadelphia polling place during the 2008 Election. “Protecting Black Panthers” is an editorial by “The Washington Times” that reveals how Jerry Jackson, one of the Black Panther defendants, is an elected member of Philadelphia's 14th Ward Democratic Committee and was a credentialed poll watcher for Obama and the Democratic Party. I would post the URL that this and more came from, but the new Yahoo board wouldn't take the URL.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1346076009838</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 10:00:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346076379839-14</Id><Topic><Title>Middle class</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1346069384905</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 08:09:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well lughead, if you were middle class instead of low class you would realize the only chance for the middle class is the expansion of the economy.

That's obvious from his 20 year attendance at a black racist "church" run by Rev Wright. When challenged about that he said, "I could no more disown him (Reverend Wright) than I could the black community". Soon thereafter he did disown him when he saw it threatend his chances to be elected.

Gregory reminded the men of his previous interview with Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), in the middle of the bank’s “London Whale” trading crisis, which has cost the firm almost $6 billion and counting. Gregory asked Dimon on May 13 if it was “misplaced criticism” to blame Wall Street for bringing the economy down without anyone on Wall Street having gone to jail as a result. Dimon said the criticism was fair, and that the public had a sense that “there’s been no Old Testament justice here, that no one was punished,” he said. But he argued that blaming “everybody” was also wrong: “If you think someone did something wrong, go get those people that did something wrong and blame them. In the meantime, the rest of us should hold hands, get together -- collaborate -- business and government together to fix the problems. It’s going to be very hard for government to do it on its own and business can’t do it without collaborating with the government.” Visionary Leader Gregory asked the same question of the Aug. 13 panel on Nantucket. Welch, the former chairman and CEO of General Electric Co. (GE), answered first. “Do you think the guy leading the country could have a more balanced approach to the recklessness of some hothead businessman, rather than demonize him?” Welch asked rhetorically, his ire at President Barack Obama apparent throughout much of the discussion. “We need a leader who has a vision” he said, not someone who is focused on demonizing business leaders. Like Dimon, Welch emphasized the importance of getting Washington to work closely with business leaders, including those on Wall Street, to get the country’s economy humming again.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1346077474238</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 10:24:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346077481152-18</Id><Topic><Title>THE NEW FORMAT IS VERY BAD</Title><Username>jacksonmarcel444</Username><Timestamp>1346069466571</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 08:11:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bots will have to be updated to post in the new format, so we may see a temporary decline in the noise level.</Msg><Username>gudonov</Username><Timestamp>1346077481152</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 10:24:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346077682000-19</Id><Title>RWNJ at the convention ???</Title><Msg>Would seem to indicate they all come from Floriduh.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1346077682000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 10:28:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346077897877-20</Id><Title>New Format: Typical Yahoo incompetence.</Title><Msg>Imagine a company so incompetent, so poorly run that they make this POS their public face.

Of course the liberal media will hide the story because Christians will be outraged to learn that muslims have been invited to pray and demonstrate at the Democrats' premier event while the offer by the top Catholic priest in America to say a simple non-sectarian prayer at the event has been rejected. Cardinal Timothy Dolan offered to deliver the prayer at both the DNC and the RNC. The RNC accepted.his offer.. Obama, your anti-Chrstian bigotry is disgustingly obvious.</Msg><Username>reasonableme53</Username><Timestamp>1346123719991</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 23:15:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346124085624-78</Id><Topic><Title>Muslims to pray at Democrat Convention.
