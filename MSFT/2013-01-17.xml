When it was adopted, "arms" included muzzle-loaded muskets and pistols, swords, knives, bows with arrows, and spears. However, a common- law definition would be "light infantry weapons which can be carried and used, together with ammunition, by a single militiaman, functionally equivalent to those commonly used by infantrymen in land warfare." That certainly includes modern rifles and handguns, full-auto machine guns and shotguns, grenade and grenade launchers, flares, smoke, tear gas, incendiary rounds, and anti-tank weapons, but not heavy artillery, rockets, or bombs, or lethal chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. Somewhere in between we need to draw the line. The standard has to be that "arms" includes weapons which would enable citizens to effectively resist government tyranny, but the precise line will be drawn politically rather than constitutionally. The rule should be that "arms" includes all light infantry weapons that do not cause mass destruction. If we follow the rule that personal rights should be interpreted broadly and governmental powers narrowly, which was the intention of the Framers, instead of the reverse, then "arms" must be interpreted broadly.""</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1358438686635</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 11:04:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358439456168-35</Id><Title>Apple And Android's Stunning Race To One Billion Users In Context</Title><Msg>Google it.

It's impossible to say for certain, but here's a look at what it might have meant. NEWTOWN -- A tough assault weapons ban might have blocked the sale of the Bushmaster XM-15 that Adam Lanza's mother bought legally and which police say he used to kill all his victims in the school. A ban on high-capacity magazines might also have reduced the killing power of the weapons he brought to the school. President Barack Obama signs executive orders on gun violence during an event at the White House in Washington, January 16, 2013. AURORA -- As with Newtown, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines might have reduced the killing power that James Holmes brought into the movie theater. TUCSON -- Federal law bars gun sales to anyone who "is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance." When Jared Loughner attempted to enlist in the Army, he admitted he was a drug user. That information was never reported to the FBI for inclusion in the background check database, because a Justice Department policy dating from the Clinton administration directed federal agencies not to report information volunteered by drug users, for fear that it would deter drug users from seeking treatment.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1358445639351</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:00:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358446123813-48</Id><Topic><Title>Colossal Advancement for Microsoft Corporation. **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>orlando.dimattia</Username><Timestamp>1358425125074</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 07:18:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so happy for this</Msg><Username>fitchettgregory</Username><Timestamp>1358446123813</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:08:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358447446905-49</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Corporation UPDATED CHARTS!</Title><Username>ondanwilla</Username><Timestamp>1358439431409</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 11:17:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>this one keeps me thinking</Msg><Username>lowry1genevieve</Username><Timestamp>1358447446905</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:30:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358447511227-50</Id><Topic><Title>Colossal Advancement for Microsoft Corporation. **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>orlando.dimattia</Username><Timestamp>1358425125074</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 07:18:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>best out there period</Msg><Username>williamsaaron54</Username><Timestamp>1358447511227</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:31:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358448312894-51</Id><Topic><Title>Colossal Advancement for Microsoft Corporation. **MUST SEE**</Title><Username>orlando.dimattia</Username><Timestamp>1358425125074</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 07:18:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>dont buy into the hype people be smart</Msg><Username>francisco.wright</Username><Timestamp>1358448312894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:45:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358448838155-52</Id><Title>What if the founding fathers misspelled 'bare' ?</Title><Msg>Or they wanted to say: 'the right of the bears to keep people arms' ?</Msg><Username>muchomacho42</Username><Timestamp>1358448838155</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 13:53:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358449267973-53</Id><Topic><Title>America Does Not Have a Gun Problem</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1358434687653</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 09:58:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is so idiotic - almost every restaurant, movie, bowling alley, etc. is jam packed with people.

It sucks. It's the "New Coke" of the new millennium. I've been asking around and I haven't met a single person who doesn't hate it. Despite the denials, they are going to suffer badly for this misstep, and take down the desktop/laptop industry with them.

""(Touting his sick gun fetish.) Unfortunately there are approximately two million injuries resulting from motor vehicle transport per year, but this is only about twenty-five times as many injuries than result from privately owned firearms in the United States which typically exceed 80,000 per year. Sadder still, although the total number of fatalities resulting from motor vehicle accidents has been reduced to approximately 32,000 per year in the last full year (2011) of compiled data, the total number of fatalities resulting from discharge of privately held firearms had in that year been approximately equal to the death toll on our highways. of the more than 32,000 tragic deaths resulting from the use of privately held firearms in 2011, over 60 percent, more than 19,000 were deaths due to self-inflicted gunshot wounds. Over 11,000 of the deaths caused by privately owned guns were homicidal and appallingly over 800 were the result of "accidental" discharges. Although automobiles are useful for transporting oneself to and from work and dropping the children off at school (hopeflly not to face a Hawfreak-like raving lunatic with a gun), the primary use for privately held firearms is apparently to kill oneself. Gary Cooper-like "good guys" facing down "bad guys" in black hats (or more bluntly put, black skins): no statistics on that - it's probably BS spouted by right-wingnut moes with genital deficiencies. Armed insurrections to overthrow "tyrants" (not in black hats very often, but you get the picture): none in this country. The the slavers who tried that found out that the "tyrants" that were ripe for overthrow were themselves.
