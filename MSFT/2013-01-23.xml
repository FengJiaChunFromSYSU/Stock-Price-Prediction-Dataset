It would all fit SO nicely together! DELL is NOT a "sinkhole" but rather, a brilliant company well on the way to re-constructing itself for the current technological marketplace. By going private, DELL is getting itself out of the quarterly-earnings spotlight to buy the time necessare to complete its transformation. (I am an Austin, TX resident, DELL shareholder--as well as MSFT-- and close follower of DELL and its doings.) MSFT is a company once again on the rise while in time AAPL has nowhere to go but down unless it can find another Steve Jobs--and that's not going to happen.

Surface RT for lower cost and good performance, and Surface Win 8 Pro for excelent perpromance. However, Surface Pro has battery life just 5 hours or so. It will make perfact sense for MSFt to sell naother Surface model int he near future that has the atom chip. Similar models from smsang is already selling, and it appears to be selling well at Best Buy. With INTC atom chip, MSft will be able to have a Surface tablet that will be a aprice point that is somweger between Surface RT and Surface Pro,and most importantly, the new Surface will have battery life 8-10 hours. Of course, down the road, MSft shold make more Surface modles that will have different sizes and even better perfomance along with battery lfe about 10 hours. Hopefully, MSF will be able to achieve this with INTC Haswell chips.</Msg><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1358962984195</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:43:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358963044654-27</Id><Title>The earning has been priced in to the stock price!</Title><Msg>Any tiny surprise for slight good news will push stock to over $29!</Msg><Username>stocker4949</Username><Timestamp>1358963044654</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:44:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358963123981-28</Id><Topic><Title>All smart people know Obama does not possess a leadership bone</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1358900205767</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 19:16:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tell that to Osama Bin Laden.</Msg><Username>sterlingsnow97</Username><Timestamp>1358963123981</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 12:45:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358963184071-29</Id><Title>Remember last quarter IBM missed the revenus and the stock jumped over 6% from low $18o to be nearly $190.</Title><Msg>Take a look where it is now!

MS had NOTHING to do with it. w8 software certainly did not have ANY part in driving those creations. "Apple worshipers just can't submit to a new dominance, that will take over for the next 5 years."

That was referring to the rose garden speech about Benghazi, where Obama mentiond 9/11, and the rwnj's glommed onto that, and say the Benghazi speech was therefore about 9/11. Even tho the day befor the Pres already gave a 9/11 speech. It seems he needed to make another 9/11 speech on 9/12, full of statements about Benghazi as a side note, they seem to say, as ludricous as that could be. They are unbelievably stupid, the rwnjs.

Voters clearly dismissed Governor Romney and the GOP’s negative strategy. Romney’s one good debate performance was not enough to make up for a campaign in which neither the party nor the candidate offered a positive vision, much less a vision for the future. The Republicans need to go back to the drawing board. The brand is in trouble and all the money spent on attack ads did nothing to help and, arguably, hurt the Republican brand – which unfortunately stands for very little these days. Their divisive approach must be thrown out in favor of a proactive message on growth and job creation. We failed to see this at any stage in the campaign and it would have surely made a difference in the outcome.</Msg><Username>bogglepuffer</Username><Timestamp>1358971965843</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 15:12:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358972213743-58</Id><Title>Polling Shows the GOP Brand Sinking Like Concrete in Water: Only 26 Percent View Republican Party Positively</Title><Msg>Polling Shows the GOP Brand Sinking Like Concrete in Water: Only 26 Percent View Republican Party Positively If the Republicans are moving away from a confrontation with President Obama on the debt ceiling, a just-released NBC/Wall Street journal poll may hold the answer as to why: 49 percent of Americans view the GOP negatively, while only 26 percent view the party positively. In contrast, the Democratic Party, in the survey conducted January 12-15, had a 44% favorability rating. Looking toward the 2014 mid-term election, the Republicans (at this moment – and polling can shift like the wind) face the possibility of a wave election that breaks like a tsunami washing over their gerrymandered Tea Party House majority. According to Jay Bookman of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution: While Republicans still hold the House majority, they lost seats in the 2012 election and acknowledge that they held onto the majority only because of gerrymandering. Majorities of Republican voters reject key proponents of the GOP agenda, including cuts to Social Security and Medicare. In fact, 63 percent of GOP voters say the congressional GOP is out of touch.

After years of product stagnation, and a big market shift toward mobile devices from PCs, Microsoft’s future relied on the company seeing customers demonstrate they were ready to jump in heavily for Windows8 products – including the new Surface tablet. But that did not happen. With the data now coming it, it is clear the market movement away from Microsoft products, toward Apple and Android products, has not changed. On Christmas eve, as people turned on their new devices and launched their first tweet, Surface came in dead last – a mere 2% compared to the number of people tweeting from iPads. (Kindle was second, Android third.) Looking at more traditional units shipped information, UBS analysts reported Surface sales were 5% of iPads shipped. And usability reviews continue to run highly negative for Surface and Win8. Including CNNMoney’s well thought out article about why transitional products like Surface have an inherent, likely insurmountable design failure. PC sales declining This inability to make a big splash, and mount a serious attack on Apple/Android domination, is bad news for Microsoft especially because we now know that traditional PC sales are well into decline. Despite the big Win8 launch and promotion, holiday PC sales declined over 3% compared to 2011 as journalists reported customers found “no compelling reason to upgrade.” Ouch. Looking deeper, for the 4th quarter PC sales declined by almost 5% according to Gartner research, and by almost 6.5% according to IDC. Both groups no longer expect a rebound in PC shipments, as they believe homes will no longer have more than 1 PC due to mobile device penetration, a market where Surface and Win8 phones have failed to make a significant impact or move beyond a tiny market share. Users increasingly see the complexity of shifting to Win8 as not worth the effort; and if a switch</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1358991206748</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 20:33:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358992454771-89</Id><Title>El Reg: Windows RT DOA</Title><Msg>Analysis Industry doomsayers were circling Windows 8 like buzzards before it even launched, but they picked the wrong carcass. Microsoft's real 2012 roadkill was Win8's ARM-powered cousin, Windows RT. The chattering class's comparisons of Windows 8 and Windows Vista are premature – it will take several more quarters before we can gauge how Redmond's latest OS will play out in the marketplace. But with the holiday season behind us, it's now plain that Window RT is a flop. Let's be clear: we're not slagging Surface, Microsoft's design-minded line of convertible tablets. By most accounts, Surface is a compelling piece of kit from a hardware perspective. The prospect of Microsoft launching an Intel-based Surface with Windows 8 Pro later this month should have Redmond's OEM partners tugging nervously at their collars. The problem is that Microsoft chose to launch Surface based on an ARM processor running Windows RT, a misguided stab at a tablet-centric user experience that hoped to capture something of what made Apple's iPad so successful. Instead, Redmond delivered an oddly hobbled OS that's neither fish nor fowl, one that falls somewhere between Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 – but with the advantages of neither. For all Microsoft's hype around Surface RT, customers aren't buying it – literally. According to the latest estimates from UBS analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft has sold only around 1 million Surface fondleslabs since the line launched in October 2012. And Thill was an optimist; he expected Redmond to shift twice that many.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1358992454771</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 20:54:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358992578246-90</Id><Topic><Title>pump dither pump dither pump, pump pump...</Title><Username>david_robert_watkins</Username><Timestamp>1358985822367</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 19:03:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wont somebody stop by and pump me, 45th ave in st PETERS burg florida</Msg><Username>david_robert_watkins</Username><Timestamp>1358992578246</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 20:56:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358992861662-91</Id><Topic><Title>MMGW is a scientific frawd, anybody with a sciance degree like me can tell ya why</Title><Username>david_robert_watkins</Username><Timestamp>1358986726402</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 19:18:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anuther thing, these environmentul scientists claim to be able to use tree ring data to smooth out their manully red thermomeur t data.

Microsoft Corp.'s MSFT +1.69%fiscal second-quarter results, due Thursday, are viewed as a litmus test of the software giant's bid to become cool and relevant again. It was the first period to reflect October's launch of the company's Windows 8 operating system and the associated Surface tablet. Microsoft pulled out all the stops, committing a reported $1.5 billion—that isn't a typo—to market the platform. Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Microsoft is committing a reported $1.5 billion to market Windows 8 and the Surface tablet. . Its initial bang for the buck may have fallen short, as earnings estimates for the quarter ended in December have dropped to 75 cents a share from 90 cents last summer. A year earlier, Microsoft earned 78 cents. Key to Microsoft's profit is an expected jump in revenue at the critical Windows Live division to $5.8 billion, from $3.24 billion last quarter, as the new operating system went on sale. An executive recently said Microsoft sold over 60 million licenses or upgrades for Windows 8. That is good, but not great. Analysts at Deutsche Bank DBK.XE -1.50%were among those trimming fiscal 2013 estimates recently on weaker-than-expected PC sales. But while a disappointing result or outlook on Thursday could send Microsoft's shares skidding, the risk to shareholders actually is lower than before the launch. Following exhaustive reviews, investors already know Windows 8 and associated products aren't a disaster. Sales may have trailed expectations, but they were nevertheless substantial. Meanwhile, Microsoft has trailed the S&amp;P 500 by 13 percentage points over the past four months from a level that already had value investors taking notice. Now, at 9.6 times forecast fiscal 2013 earnings, the stock still trades with a question mark hanging over it. True, the Windows Live division always has been Microsoft's cash machine, churning out billions of dollars annually to reward shareholders and invest in less-profitable units. But Microsoft is more than Windows. The company's Servers &amp; Tools and Microsoft Business divisions generated a combined $23 billion in operating income over the past four quarters. The company's market value less net cash is just 7.5 times as much, a modest valuation even without Windows. Investors fretting about the success of Microsoft's glitzy new platform should appreciate that beauty is more than skin deep.</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1359003139576</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-23 23:52:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
