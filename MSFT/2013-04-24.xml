Harmonic (HLIT) closed Tuesday a new 52-week high of $6.02 and Tuesday evening reported a non-GAAP EPS loss of ($0.02) down $0.05 from a non-GAAP EPS profit of $0.03 last year. HLIT's trailing 12 month non-GAAP EPS declined from $0.25 to $0.20 and the stock afterhours was trading for $5.89, which equals a P/E of 29.45. While HLIT's non-GAAP EPS fell $0.05 year-over-year, their competitor Concurrent (CCUR) reports on April 23rd and CCUR is expected to report GAAP EPS of $0.09 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 vs. GAAP EPS of $0.04 and non-GAAP EPS of $0.08 last year. CCUR's trailing non-GAAP EPS will likely increase by $0.05 next week from $0.35 up to $0.40! This means CCUR will have double the trailing EPS of HLIT and CCUR closed Tuesday at only $6.77! With HLIT trading at $5.89 afterhours, CCUR could be ready to make a move to double HLIT's price or $11.78! CCUR has just 8.72mm o/s, a market cap of $59.03mm, $24.6mm in cash, no debt, and an extremely low enterprise value of $34.43mm or only 0.55X its trailing revenue of $62.59mm. CCUR has large gross margins of 58.81%, which are 30.69% higher than HLIT's gross margins of 45%! HLIT is trading with an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 0.93. Clearly, CCUR deserves a multiple 30.69% higher than HLIT. This would give CCUR an enterprise value/revenue ratio of 1.22 and value CCUR at a share price of $11.58! HLIT recently sold their very low margin cable access business for $46mm, which was breaking even with $52.9mm in revenues. HLIT's cable access business sold for 0.87X revenues when it only had low gross margins of 30%! CCUR's gross margins are nearly double and CCUR is about to report their 5th straight quarter of profitability! There is no way on earth that CCUR should have an enterprise value/revenue ratio of less than 1, which means CCUR should be trading at a minimum share price of $10!</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1366783520566</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 02:05:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366792093924-6</Id><Title>Linux on mainframes used more widely than you might think</Title><Msg>"All of the large banks are using it [Linux on IBM System z], but don't want to talk about it," CA Technologies distinguished engineer Scott Fagen told iTWire.</Msg><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1366792093924</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 04:28:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366795597338-7</Id><Title>Bush tied with Obama in popularity</Title><Msg>In spite of never ending criticism of Bush by many in the press and in spite of blind-eyed fawning adoration for Obama by that same group, over time reality wins out. And in spite of the spin by the likes of hawcraper the is based more the sobering up from mass hysteria favorability and shedding of baseless guilt when viewing Obama. I.E. we were tired of the Bush style after eight years, but despite his flaws when compared to Obama he doesn't look so bad. If the press coverage flipped to reality then Bush would have a comfortable double digit lead. Time seems to favor reality, and while most ex Presidents' popularity does rise over time, for context, Clinton's actually fell.</Msg><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1366795597338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 05:26:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366796719041-8</Id><Topic><Title>Linux on mainframes used more widely than you might think</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1366792093924</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 04:28:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No surprise to me that they are using it, I've been hearing of Linux on IBM System Z for many years.

IBM has long been a strong supporter and contributer to Linux, but dating from the SCO wars, some users have been cautious about making it public knowledge that they were using Linux, just because they didn't need the hassle of an interminable lawsuit. Probably that was the main thing Microsoft wanted to accomplish by brokering financial support for SCO. SCO never had the ghost of a leg to stand on, legally, and no doubt Microsoft knew that all along, but that didn't stop them. That should be a long dead issue by now, but probably not everyone has heard the news of SCO's death and burial.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1366809187892</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:13:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366809461398-20</Id><Topic><Title>Bush tied with Obama in popularity</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1366795597338</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 05:26:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When the facts come out written by honest historians, not reconstructionist liberals, Bush's popularity will rise, while the facts will cause Obama's rankings to fall.....to one of the lousiest Presidents in American history.</Msg><Username>joedokes45</Username><Timestamp>1366809461398</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 09:17:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366809612787-21</Id><Title>hawhaw 68 Years Old And Socially #$%$ But Still Posting For 12 Years</Title><Msg>12 years of online fukery is a long time to be wasting your life.

The suspect already has a designation of 212(3)(b) under the Patriot Act, the highest level terrorist designation. DHS Secretary Janet "The Silverback" Napolitano, who dismissed Congressional questions about the suspect last week as irrelevant, is now revising to say he was just “in the wrong place at the wrong time” and was “never a subject,” but WAS placed on the terrorist watchlist? What? The file they opened on the guy on the day of the bombing listed him as armed and dangerous. He was already in the system. He was allowed into America in August 2012 under the "special advisory option,” which is used for visiting politicians, journalists and various VIPs. He was not vetted, which must be why his 212(3)(b) status wasn't picked up - that status makes him inadmissible to the U.S. The original story from DHS was that he was to be deported because of an expired student visa to attend school in Ohio - which he didn't attend. He lived in Boston and his visa doesn't expire until 2016. Silverback lied to Congress saying that there was never a plan to deport him. He was already on the no-fly list as a known terrorist. As questions increased, his file was amended to remove the deportation reference, then someone later went in and tried to destroy both the original event file and an amended versions. Copies had already been made and are in the hands of the House. The electronic system the feds use identifies all who access or edit files so names are forthcoming. AND WHERE THE HEII IS THIS GUY NOW ANYWAY???!?!! This administration of left fringe kooks can obviously no longer be simply deemed incompetent. They are putting us at risk.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1366821158348</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 12:32:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366821759843-62</Id><Topic><Title>WHERE is SKIDSLIDS!!????</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366650705192</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 13:11:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey Skid hope you are still alive as I tried to warn you but to no avail....

If customers do not use it, sue them. The Untouchable has something to leverage: mighty legal lawyers to pave the waves for class action lawsuits. Settle now or paying more later. ZTE paying Microsoft royalty to use Google's software? It is not April's fool. China's ZTE has agreed to pay Microsoft a royalty for devices it makes using Google Inc's Android and Chrome operating systems. ZTE is the latest in a line of hardware manufacturers that have struck a patent deal with Microsoft, which has successfully argued that Android - which Google provides free to handset makers - uses Microsoft-owned technology. Google itself, and its Motorola phone maker unit, are the most notable holdouts against a patent agreement with Microsoft. Those differences could be settled soon, depending on the judge's verdict in a patent trial in Seattle. Reaching agreement with ZTE means Microsoft now has patent deals in place with four of the five leading Android phone makers. Microsoft already has agreements with South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and LG Corp, and with Taiwan's HTC. The ZTE deal marks progress for Microsoft with companies operating in China, following last week's patent agreement with contract manufacturer Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, parent of Foxconn. Microsoft said it now has Android patent deals with about 20 device makers, and 60 percent of Android phones sold worldwide are covered by a Microsoft patent license. Microsoft really has become a snarling, vicious Behemoth trying to eat up the whole world!Microsoft management is a disgrace to America and Steve Ballmer is certifiably insane.</Msg><Username>joegi50</Username><Timestamp>1366828365993</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 14:32:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366828545965-89</Id><Title>Tea Party Popularity Falls To Record Low, Rasmussen Reports</Title><Msg>According to a new Rasmussen poll released Monday, the Tea Party is less popular than it has ever been, with only 30% of likely voters saying they hold favorable views of the group.

MSFT is firing on all cylinders. (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will unveil its much-anticipated next-generation Xbox on May 21 following months of speculation the company is gearing up to announce a new video game console this summer. The company sent out media invitations on Wednesday, hinting it would be announcing the successor to its seven-year old Xbox 360. A new console from the software company will come on the heels of rival Sony's announcement in February that it will launch the PlayStation4 this holiday season. Microsoft's May event will be held at its Xbox campus in Redmond, Washington, just a month before the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, the gaming industry's largest annual convention, where next-generation consoles will be spotlighted. "On May 21, we'll mark the beginning of a new generation of games, TV and entertainment," the company said on its official blog. The Xbox 360 is the market-leading console that has an installed user base of 76 million. Gaming blogs have been afire with speculation about what features a next-generation console might offer, but Microsoft has been tight-lipped so far. The current version of the Xbox sports voice- and gesture-command capabilities.</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1366830595835</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 15:09:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366830614799-100</Id><Topic><Title>What is going on with MSFT?!?!</Title><Username>matterofmoney</Username><Timestamp>1366829181653</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 14:46:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The PC is not dead especially in enterprise.

Though the agreement, which took effect in January, provides little discretion in transferring funds and making cuts, congressional Republicans are suggesting the Obama administration has provided even less flexibility within the Federal Aviation Administration -- to disrupt air travel enough to force Congress to reach a better deal. “This imperial attitude … on the part of the administration is disgusting,” said Kentucky Republican Rep.

Though the company has captured a ~85% market share of the PC microprocessor market, the stock has been range bound in the last few years. Intel is now targeting the fast growing smartphone and tablet semiconductor space. Intel has started to increase its focus on mobile products, which are growing much faster than the PC and laptops. Intel's new processors are focused on reducing power consumption, which is critical for success in the mobile devices space. Intel's new Haswell chips for PCs/laptops are ready to ship in the 2nd quarter of 2013, and they will hit the ball out of the park in terms of battery performance. The Haswell powered ultrabooks and notebooks will give the same battery performance as the iPads, which should help in slowing down the cannibalization by tablets. ------------ What this all means to MSFT? IMO, it is a huge gain.</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1366844062971</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 18:54:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366844477564-145</Id><Title>XBOX 720 is the front end of SOFT TV....</Title><Msg>Folks this announcement is significant as we will beat AAPL to iTV on May 21/2013....

When the earnings came out folks realized the pundits were full of a lot hot air. PC sales although slow are fine. Windows 8 is fine and Microsoft Cloud and search are on fire. Stupid selling led to a wonderful buying opportunity.

Despite vast differences with President George W. Bush on ideology, style and temperament, President Barack Obama has stuck with Bush policies or aspirations on a number of fronts, from counterterrorism to immigration, from war strategy to the global fight against AIDS. Even on tax policy, where Bush advocated lower tax rates for all and Obama pushed for higher rates on the rich, Bush's tax cuts for the middle class not only have survived under Obama, they have become permanent.</Msg><Username>comrade_obama1</Username><Timestamp>1366852332324</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 21:12:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366854399943-156</Id><Topic><Title>I.E. 10 displays the passwords after entry -- better use firefox.</Title><Username>y2k7trillionover</Username><Timestamp>1366773623514</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 23:20:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why did they compromise security for I.E. 10?
