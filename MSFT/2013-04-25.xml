GREENVILLE, Wis. (April 24, 2013) – Last year, when Principal Lavanta Williams first came to Ridgegate Elementary School in Fort Bend, Texas, the school was considered “low performing” in math and reading proficiency, after failing to meet Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) targets for both subjects. He was in need of new ways to move his students forward and get them excited about the subjects they were learning. Today, state assessment tests show Ridgegate has met its AYP targets for both reading and math, with 90 percent and 86 percent of students meeting the standards respectively, with an increase of 12 percent in both subjects over the previous year. Principal Williams credits a customized intervention solution from EPS Literacy and Intervention, a division of School Specialty, for spurring these impressive gains in math and reading among his students. “These products worked wonders for my kids,” said Principal Williams. “It is amazing the progress we’ve seen. This customized intervention solution really provided a foundation for us and helped fill in the gaps of what was missing in the classroom.” Teachers and parents were also astounded by the progress shown by students. Reading specialist, Sandra Williams, who has been a driving force behind implementing EPS intervention solutions across Ridgegate Elementary, did not want to let any more students slip through the cracks and feels these powerful tools have made a world of difference. “We have students who come in every year who struggle, who I feel like we have lost…and now that we have this very intense program – the Academy of READING® – these students are able to read.” Williams’ colleague, math specialist Giorgette Ephriam, teaches “extreme strugglers,” and utilized Academy of MATH® as an interventi</Msg><Username>strongbuy33</Username><Timestamp>1366870857336</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 02:20:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366871672088-4</Id><Topic><Title>Why Bill Gate not going to help SCHSQ.PK company?</Title><Username>strongbuy33</Username><Timestamp>1366870857336</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 02:20:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What difference does it make; he hasn't helped MSFT either in the last 10 years.</Msg><Username>consequences9022</Username><Timestamp>1366871672088</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 02:34:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366887417402-5</Id><Title>LWNJs thought Boston bombing a right wing tax protest, instead it was welfare tax funded ingrates</Title><Msg>thanks, Obama!

The MacBook Pro 13 was rated the best performing Windows laptop. One of the biggest reasons: 'every Windows installation on it is clean.' (Credit: Soluto) An Apple 13-inch MacBook Pro is the "best performing" Windows laptop? Yes, says a PC services company that has done "frustration analytics" on some of the best-selling PCs. The MacBook Pro won out over established PC makers like Dell, Acer, and Lenovo, according to Soluto, which was quick to explain its finding. A main factor in this machine's metrics is the fact that every Windows installation on it is clean. With PC manufacturers loading so much crapware on new laptops, this is a bit of an unfair competition. But, on the other hand, PC makers should look at this data and aspire to ship PCs that perform just as well as a cleanly installed MacBook Pro. The report went on to admit that it might be more fair to compare a cleanly installed MacBook Pro with a cleanly installed PC from Acer or Dell. But there's method in Soluto's metrics: "We simply compared the real PCs in the field...We believe it's more representative of reality." The metrics (see image at top) include crashes per week, hangs per week, Blue Screens (of Death) per week, and average boot time. Soluto did list the disadvantages of running Windows on a Mac, including that it's more work to set up Windows on a Mac and there may be driver issues. Acer's Aspire E1-571 came in second and Dell's XPS 13 received the third-highest ranking.

The triple-A-rated company today floated guidance in the T+35 area, plus or minus three basis points, for a new five-year issue, at T+70-73, for new 10-year notes and at T+90-93 for new 30-year bonds, sources said. Talk was set firm to initial whispers in the mid-to-high T+30s for the five-year tranche, in the T+70-75 range for 10-year notes, and in the T+90-95 range for the long bonds. On Nov. 2 last year, Microsoft set a new all-time-low bar for five-year funding costs with a 0.875% issue of notes due 2017 at T+27, or 0.993%. The company also placed 2.125% notes due 2022 at T+47, or 2.19%, and 3.5% bonds due 2042 at T+67. Prior to that offering, Microsoft had not tapped the markets since the first quarter of 2011. For reference, all three of the outstanding issues traded earlier this week only modestly through those early whispers for today’s offering, including in a G-spread range from 25-28 bps for the 2017 issue, trade data show. The 10-year issue traded earlier this week at a G-spread of 68 bps, and the long bonds changed hands earlier this week at G-spreads in the mid T+80s. The company today may not set new all-time lows for reoffer yields, but it is on track to set the bar lower for five-year issues inked so far in 2013. The firm end of guidance indicates a five-year reoffer yield as low as 1.04%. The existing low reoffer for five-year notes this year was established earlier this month by Wal-Mart (AA/Aa2) with 1.125% notes priced at T+45, or 1.14%.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366910493389</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 13:21:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366910584953-72</Id><Topic><Title>SO far today, it is all short selling by the big boys....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366734986596</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-23 12:36:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1366910584953</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 13:23:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366910809299-73</Id><Title>Barbara Bush on Jeb run: 'We've had enough Bushes' in White House AMERICA AGREES!!!!!</Title><Msg>How true!

He called the firms that downgraded Microsoft out by NAME. That will have future benefits. It will, and it was an unusual move. Especially since he was saying my kids don't even know who Microsoft is that same week the downgrades were flying. I said I would give him a pass and I guess no more Cramer bashing from me.

Don't get me wrong, AAPL is a good company, despite the fact that it was over-hyped and Steve Jobs whom I respect as an innovator, was a dirty player in business as we all remember from his TV ads.... Steve Jobs created many innovations that ultimately became "toys" as MSFT with Windows 8, Office, Cloud is creating "tools" by integrating data management and processing for desktop and mobility for businesses and consumers alike.... For AAPL sadly, their two main products, the iPhone and the iPad are becoming commodities and they are going to suffer and the shares may end up trading around $300, like what happened to DELL.... MSFT has reinvented its business model despite being late to move onto mobility and our time is here now as we will eat IBM, AMZN, Google, Yahoo, AAPL, DELL, HPQ's lunches and some.... MSFT will trade above $50.00 in a year's time as Windows 8, Office, Cloud, Surface, XBOX and soon SOFT TV and SOFTWATCH hit the market. This is the power of integration and is the business model that will come on top as it would be very cost effective and technologically compatible from A to Z.

Microsoft will launch the system in early November with two pricing models. One will be a standalone version for $499 (£323), while the other is a $299 (£193) version that requires the consumer to sign up to a two-year Xbox Live Gold subscription. The system will be based on the "core" version of Windows 8, allowing similar apps that run on the PC operating system to appear on the console. Thurrott also confirmed previous reports that the new Xbox would support Blu-ray, and that while it must be online to use, it "isn't as Draconian as many seem to believe". It was added that a third, cheaper Xbox 360 could also be released this year.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366943019889</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 22:23:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366944120934-143</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT the top AAA company....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1366910493389</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 13:21:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ALL the players in this space have a part of the puzzle with the exception of MSFT that has converged/integrated all the moving parts....

Look at the Chip performance around 4GHz and the GT2/GT3 Graphics with unmatched power management specs.... They will be hitting the market "starting" in June 2013.... They will power Surface Pro-II, Surface RT-II, Surface 7, Xbox, Windows Phones, MSFT-TV, will provide long battery life, and will generate less heat so the units could be made thinner and lighter.... In the Chip space, Intel will be slapping Qcom around and what happened a couple of days ago with their earnings is just the beginning of a downward spiral to commodity-land.... I'd say, game over for MSFT's competition.
