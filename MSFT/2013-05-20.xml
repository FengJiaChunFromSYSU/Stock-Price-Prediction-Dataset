Not only is this multiple ridiculous. And we could easily be $10 to $20 higher right now (seems to be happening before our very eyes).

Obama is a child, living in the past, wallowing in the bass-ackwards racist, anti-establishment gobbledygook "education" he has gotten throughout his life. From his hippie mother, from the void of having a walk-away father, to his kook liberal grandparents, to his weed smoking choom gang, to his racist anti-American pastor, to his wife, to his Marxist professors, to Saul Alinsky. His head and heart are full of darkness, a negative worldview, desperately flailing with the absolutely wrong remedies to correct his skewed perceptions of past wrongs. Obama is under tremendous scrutiny now, and his radicalism and incompetence are increasingly showing through. Look for more extremist talk, like this ridiculous conspiracy of ever-present racism, to come out as the screws are tightened on him and his regime. He is becoming indignant over being questioned and probed, and will come unglued when the people and the media finally say ENOUGH with his blsht.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1369057724509</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 09:48:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369057749001-17</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: "As An African American You Have To Work Twice As Hard As Anyone Else If You Want To Get By"</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1369018394443</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-19 22:53:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I asked why, and you regurgitate a snippet of some "study".

Quoting: "HELSINKI (Reuters) - A group of ex-Nokia software developers unveiled its first smartphone on Monday, aiming to prove their former employer wrong by making a success of a technology dropped by the Finnish mobile phone maker. "Jolla was founded by Nokia's former MeeGo software team that was shut down after the company decided to switch to Microsoft's Windows Phone software in 2011. "With just 70 employees and 11 million euros ($14.11 million)in venture financing, Jolla joins a handful of boutique operating systems such as Ubuntu which together have less than a one-percent presence in the mobile phone market. "Start-ups such as Jolla face a tough task breaking into the smartphone market. Google's Android operating system and Apple's iOS together account for 92 percent of all shipments, according to data from industry research firm IDC. "Even Windows Phone and BlackBerry OS trail far behind the top two with a mere 3 percent share each. "Jolla chairman Antti Saarnio said the Jolla's openness in allowing users to download Android apps would differentiate it from others. He said the dominance of the top two players wasn't necessarily permanent. " 'In the long run, if someone brings fresh and new ideas, eventually, the market changes.' " __________________________________________________ I agree, Jolla has a hard row to hoe, but these guys have #$%$ and they believe in their product, so they will be worth watching.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1369070589004</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 13:23:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369070737709-85</Id><Title>$5-10 pop tomorrow</Title><Msg>8 years of waiting .

Under his watch, the IRS went on a witch-hunt targeting his political adversaries; the FBI spied on Associated Press reporters; and four Americans were murdered in Benghazi, Libya, because the State Department and White House were negligent, possibly criminally, in failing to protect them. As serious as these matters are, Americans are about to be richly entertained by a full accounting of lies, misdeeds and coverups that could eventually implicate the IRS, the FBI and a president with the unmitigated arrogance to deny that any of it was his fault. This won’t wash with the American people, and we might therefore expect the stench of the Obama presidency to grow even more foul until the day he leaves office. Scandal Too Juicy to Ignore Even his most ardent defenders on the far left have turned against him, including a chiding David Letterman and MSNBC’s Chris Matthews. We await a hostile declaration from Sean Penn, since that would surely seal Obama’s fate. In the meantime, this hat-trick of scandals is too juicy for even a left-tilting press to contrive to ignore. They managed to tune out Bill Ayers, Reverend Wright and Obama’s unsavory background as a political rabble rouser and favored son of Chicago’s corrupt political machine. This time, however, the scandal is just too juicy for his erstwhile defenders to ignore. Assuming the malignant Obamacare goes down with the presidency, the Republic will rally to survive. For now, though, Americans – especially conservatives – can sit back and enjoy the show.

Five hundred children were locked into their school, threatened that if they did not agree to being force-vaccinated with a meningitis A vaccine, they would receive no further education. These children were vaccinated without their parents’ knowledge. This vaccine was an unlicensed product still going through the third and fourth phases of testing. Within hours, one hundred six children began to suffer from headaches, vomiting, severe uncontrollable convulsions and paralysis. The children’s wait for a doctor began. They had to wait one full week for a doctor to arrive while the team of vaccinators just carried on vaccinating others from the village. More children became sick. When the doctor finally came, he could do nothing for the children. The team of vaccinators, upon seeing what had happened, fled the village in fear.

After being shuttled around like cattle, these sick, weak children were dumped back in their village without a diagnosis and each family was given an unconfirmed sum of £1000 by the government.

That is tax evasion." No, tax evasion is illegal, that is tax avoidance, which is perfectly legal. The IRS knows about it. Evasion and avoidance are two very distinctly different legal terms. And no, you simply keep money where it's earned, it's not a loophole. You think a European worker here should pay taxes here and in their home country in Europe? The IRS covets it to squander, but they have no right to it until and unless it is repatriated.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1369102840418</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 22:20:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369103018146-179</Id><Title>HOw high will msft climb after Xbox unveiling to public at Noon tomorrow?</Title><Msg>Any guesses?

After double-digit gains during last year’s presidential election, May 13-17 saw the progressive-aligned “Lean Forward” news network hit new lows as the IRS scandal erupted and revelations that the Justice Department secretly obtained AP records became public. With 350,000 viewers on average and 94,000 among the adults 25-54 demo, MSNBC had its least-watched and lowest-rated total-day results of the year last week. That was also the lowest total-day demo result the network has had since the week of June 26-July 2, 2006, when MSNBC pulled in just 83,000 viewers among adults 25-54, according to Nielsen data.</Msg><Username>trendpicker</Username><Timestamp>1369107122700</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-20 23:32:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369107752907-185</Id><Title>teflon don presidente</Title><Msg>Saved by the storm, again.
