Well, yes, disastrous for a company like Microsoft, which extorts billions of dollars from the actually productive companies based on unproven patent claims. It's a wonderful scam, no doubt about it, and the lawyers just love it. But it's working to bring progress to a standstill, just as Bill Gates once predicted it would, before Microsoft had any patents to speak of. "WE live in a capitalistic system and the people are rewarded for their innovation and hard work..." I couldn't agree more. Free software, contrary to the lying slanders of bozos like you, is perfectly consistent with capitalism. Actually, it's probably the most reliably profitable system ever invented. It's just that the profits are measured in LOC (lines of code) rather than dollars.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368263552567</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 05:12:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368266156980-19</Id><Topic><Title>'Economy unfortunately stuck at 'New Normal' '</Title><Username>comrade_obama1</Username><Timestamp>1367336618017</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 11:43:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The level of the most important heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, has passed a long-feared milestone, scientists reported Friday, reaching a concentration not seen on the earth for millions of years.

Read All Comments (700) » Scientific instruments showed that the gas had reached an average daily level above 400 parts per million — just an odometer moment in one sense, but also a sobering reminder that decades of efforts to bring human-produced emissions under control are faltering. The best available evidence suggests the amount of the gas in the air has not been this high for at least three million years, before humans evolved, and scientists believe the rise portends large changes in the climate and the level of the sea.</Msg><Username>tocrazyright</Username><Timestamp>1368266156980</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 05:55:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368269691572-20</Id><Topic><Title>'Economy unfortunately stuck at 'New Normal' '</Title><Username>comrade_obama1</Username><Timestamp>1367336618017</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 11:43:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The level of the most important heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, has passed a long-feared milestone..."

That's all faux news does every day, political posturing in hopes of winning an election. It hasn't worked outside of places where they didn't need to win votes. You're way too excited way too early with news again. When you are outraged you were told spontaneous demonstrations by susan rice, after the Pres said terror, remember al sharia or whatever they call themselves took credit for the attack. That should satisfy you it was terror, and you can go around talking about it. There is nothing to get, nothing to cover up. A basic fact you miss with all the political attacking our President.

"Appeals court ruling could be 'death' of software patents But an EFF lawyer says the federal circuit's patent ruling doesn't provide much new guidance By Grant Gross, IDG News Service May 10, 2013 03:50 PM ET IDG News Service - A U.S. appeals court has ruled that an abstract idea is not patentable simply because it is tied to a computer system, signaling what one judge described as the "death" of software and business method patents. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that four patents held by electronic marketplace Alice are too abstract for a patent, despite a long-standing legal assumption that software running on a computer is eligible for patents. The implications of the case are huge, wrote Judge Kimberly Moore, dissenting in part with the majority decision. The ruling in CLS Bank v. Alice gives "staggering breadth to what is meant to be a narrow judicial exception" on patent ineligibility, she wrote. "And let's be clear: if all of these claims, including the system claims, are not patent-eligible, this case is the death of hundreds of thousands of patents, including all business method, financial system, and software patents as well as many computer implemented and telecommunications patents." Several recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings against patent eligibility are "causing a free fall in the patent system," Moore added. "Today, several of my colleagues would take that precedent significantly further, lumping together the asserted method, media, and system claims, and holding that they are all patent-ineligible." you think it gone now or maybe never happen because you deny it? :haha:</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368291381948</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 12:56:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368291625477-46</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo confirms Windows Phone 8 handset plans (Source ZDNet - Jan 2013)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368149383337</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 21:29:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bonk! go put on 3rd layer of makeup! you not cover up big hole where beautiful phone supposed to appear. :haha:</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368291625477</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 13:00:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368291659942-47</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo confirms Windows Phone 8 handset plans (Source ZDNet - Jan 2013)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368149383337</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-09 21:29:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how that working so far? :-D</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368291659942</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 13:00:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368291873818-48</Id><Topic><Title>Why the new Xbox will beat the Apple iTV to the Smart TV punch (Source Techradar)</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368210732135</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 14:32:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>now on yahoo news! http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/05/11/the-future-is-uncertain-for-microsofts-xbox-tv/?partner=yahootix</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368291873818</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 13:04:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368293508395-49</Id><Topic><Title>Why the new Xbox will beat the Apple iTV to the Smart TV punch (Source Techradar)</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368210732135</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 14:32:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The kid who wrote the article has no expertise on the subject and relied on a rumor by an "unnamed" source at WSJ.... .</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368293508395</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 13:31:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368293915234-50</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 Pro "Tablets" Picking Up Steam....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368238717791</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 22:18:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This great info thanks.

So you got a Windows Phone and are loving the Jams on Xbox Music. I decided to go with the best bose and I got them as sam's for half of the cost of Best ........ The reason is the sound is the best and I can hook the TV into them also and it really pops the movies &amp; music on the tv. The way you connect the phone or laptop to the speaker is via blu tooth. Here is how you can hook any speakers with a 3.5 mm input or usb to the phone. You can use a Bluetooth audio receiver. Mine cost $30 at Best B... it is a Aluratek. It is in the phone accessories. It is a tiny thing that all you have to do is plug It in to the speaker. You then set up a blu tooth connection to the Aluratek blutooth receiver. You are supposed to set the receiver in pairing mode. The Windows Phone connected immediately with no problems. All you do is click setting-blu tooth and when the new device shows click connect to it. I also hooked up a W8 netbook with no problems. So I have two W8 devices and a TV hooked to great Bose speaker that rock. Next click on Xbox music or maybe just music. Try the smart DJ. It will ask you to type in an artist and it will group a selection of songs you should like if you liked the first song. It is free and has a few short commercial every now and then. Great experience and Windows 8 is effortless to connect a blu tooth receiver to speakers.

Here is an old article about Google loosing the LAPD and they used to try and sell people on their shet by saying the LAPD uses it it's safe. A Microsoft’s Office 365 isn’t the only cloud service losing high-profile customers to security and privacy concerns. Google got a dose of the same medicine on Wednesday, with the LA Times reporting that the LAPD is now backing out of its contract with Google so it can stick with its on-premises Novell platform for e-mail. The LAPD and the city attorney’s office ultimately decided, some two years after deciding to move their e-mail systems to the cloud in order to save costs, that no cloud computing solution is really compatible with the federal security guidelines that the departments are required to follow. “It will be difficult for law enforcement to move to a cloud solution until the [security requirements] and cloud are more in line with each other,” LAPD’s CIO told the LA Times. This is definitely a blow for Google Apps, especially since the LAPD deployment was one of the early success stories that Google had been touting in its effort to get the public sector onto its platform. But unlike the problems related to the Patriot Act and EU customers, I think the damage is fairly localized in this instance. I say this for two reasons: 1) Google will overshadow this news shortly with some large announcements, and 2) the LAPD is probably wrong about the security issue here. Google is set to announce a number of very high-profile wins with Google Apps, and I know of at least one large cloud provider that’s in an internal trial of the platform. The reason that private sector companies are moving to Google Apps and Office 365 is not only that they’re cheaper than on-premises e-mail platforms, but they’re also widely acknowledged to be more secure.

The IRS apologized Friday for what it acknowledged was "inappropriate" targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election to see if they were violating their tax-exempt status. The agency blamed low-level employees, saying no high-level officials were aware. But on June 29, 2011, Lois G. Lerner, who heads the IRS division that oversees tax-exempt organizations, learned at a meeting that groups were being targeted, according to the watchdog's report. At the meeting, she was told that groups with "Tea Party," `'Patriot" or "9/12 Project" in their names were being flagged for additional and often burdensome scrutiny, the report says. The 9-12 Project is a group started by conservative TV personality Glenn Beck. Lerner instructed agents to change the criteria for flagging groups "immediately," the report says. The Treasury Department's inspector general for tax administration is expected to release the results of a nearly yearlong investigation in the coming week. The AP obtained part of the draft report, which has been shared with congressional aides. Among the other revelations, on Aug. 4, 2011, staffers in the IRS' Rulings and Agreements office "held a meeting with chief counsel so that everyone would have the latest information on the issue."</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1368324558417</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 22:09:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368324917192-99</Id><Topic><Title>WHO Is Responsible For Android's Security Fiascos?</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368313549753</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-11 19:05:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What are they doing for the older phones, I guess the same they were doing when they first came out "Nothing".

Siri, and other apps and services such as Dropbox, pose a security risk to IBM due to their requirement that user data be transmitted to and stored on third party servers. IBM’s restriction on services such as Siri follows the company’s 2010 adoption of a “bring your own device” policy, allowing employees to use personal devices to access IBM networks and data. The policy, which now sees 80,000 of the company’s 400,000 workers using their personal smartphones and tablets, has created security headaches for IBM’s IT and legal departments. Apps and services such as Siri, Dropbox, and iCloud, as a necessary requirement of their functions, transmit and store user data on third party servers, where the use and security of that data is ambiguous and falls outside of a user’s control. For example, according to Apple’s iPhone Software Licensing Agreement (PDF), “when you use Siri or Dictation, the things you say will be recorded and sent to Apple in order to convert what you say into text,” and “by using Siri or Dictation, you agree and consent to Apple’s and its subsidiaries’ and agents’ transmission, collection, maintenance, processing, and use of this information, including your voice input and User Data, to provide and improve Siri, Dictation, and other Apple products and services.” These terms, when applied to personally or professionally sensitive information, can be alarming to users and Ms. Horan found that many IBM employes were “blissfully unaware” of their implications. “We found a tremendous lack of awareness as to what constitutes a risk,” Ms. Horan said.

Google had sued the Interior Department last year claiming that it was unfairly passed over as a potential vendor for the agency's nearly $60 million cloud e-mail and collaboration system and that procurement documents for the project were worded in a way that heavily favored Microsoft and its Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS) Federal edition. The DOI Wednesday scraped its plans to go with Microsoft and said it will evaluate other vendors for its cloud e-mail and collaboration systems. Federal Judge Susan Braden Wednesday issued an order of dismissal with prejudice following a status conference in which the Department of the Interior said it would go back to the drawing board and renew its search for a cloud provider in light of market changes, court documents indicate. The agency said it will examine Microsoft competitors as part of its new procurement process. The DOI said that its determination and findings in seeking a cloud vendor was "now stale in light of new developments in technology and entrants into the market. The Department of the Interior has decided not to proceed with the procurement of cloud-email and collaboration services…," court documents show. The DOI is now preparing a request for information for potential issuance of a solicitation to procure cloud and e-mail services.

The FBI knows some vendors may have a tough time meeting those requirements, but it says that’s the price of doing business with federal law enforcement, Computerworld‘s Jaikumar Vijayan reports. “The FBI remains committed to using technology in its information-sharing processes, but not at the sacrifice of the security of the information with which it has been entrusted,” Stephen Fischer Jr., a spokesman for the FBI’s CJIS division, said on Tuesday in an e-mail to Computerworld. The move follows the Los Angeles Police Department dropping Google Apps two months ago because it could not comply with the CJIS requirements. The LAPD and the city attorney’s office ultimately decided, some two years after deciding to move their e-mail systems to the cloud in order to save costs, that no cloud computing solution is really compatible with the federal security guidelines that the departments are required to follow, Cloudline’s Jon Stokes wrote at the time. “It will be difficult for law enforcement to move to a cloud solution until the [security requirements] and cloud are more in line with each other,” LAPD’s CIO told the Los Angeles Times at the time. There does seem to be a case the the CJIS requirements are unreasonable; that is, beyond the scope of in-house services. Jon Stokes wrote at the time of the LAPD decision to drop Google Apps: In my coverage of cloud over the past quarter, I’ve observed a growing consensus in the private sector that cloud e-mail providers see more attacks, are better informed, and have more money to spend on security than any one enterprise.

A 2200% growth in the number of malicious Android apps, can that be right? Unfortunately it is. According to the Mobile Threat Report Q1 2012 (PDF) released by security company F-Secure, the number of malicious Android application package files (APKs) they received in the first three months of the year grew from 139 in 2011 to 3063 for the same period in 2012. Similarly, in 2011 security researchers discovered 10 new families of Android malware. Move forward twelve months, and that number has grown nearly four-fold with 37 new families and variants discovered in Q1 2012. So why the growth? For one part, it is due to Android’s popularity. As market shares have grown and companies like Samsung have moved into the top handset manufacturer spots, Android has become a lucrative target for malware writers. Greed is a powerful motivator and the majority of malware is written to gain money illegally and unethically. The 2200% jump in malicious apps is largely due to attempts by malware writers to modify malware signatures to defeat anti-virus detection coupled with an increase in the number of apps trojanized.

But many IT teams have found that the projected versus actual costs of using GAFB increases their total cost of ownership to far more than Google’s claimed $50/user annual fee. GAFB is missing critical features and functionality that you get at no additional cost with Microsoft® products. Adding those missing features and functionality to make GAFB enterprise-ready can cost you more for deployment, IT support, and user training and lost productivity. Deployment Costs Migrating Email Data: Customers who deploy Google Apps burden their IT teams to migrate email messages, contacts, tasks, folders, and other data from messaging solutions such as Microsoft Exchange Server. Contacts You must install and run Google Apps Sync for Outlook to migrate contacts from Microsoft Outlook®, and install an add-on to manage organization-wide contacts. Tasks You cannot migrate Tasks from Outlook to Google, so you have to recreate Tasks. Distribution Lists Google Apps Sync will not migrate distribution lists, so you must recreate and maintain distribution lists in Gmail. Public Folders To use Exchange public folders for shared documents, you must manually upload all documents and mark them as shared in Google Apps or use a third-party application.
