What was the source of Obama's foundation in Marxism? Throughout his 2008 Presidential campaign and term in office, questions have been raised regarding Barack Obama's family background, economic philosophy, and fundamental political ideology. Dreams from My Real Father is the alternative Barack Obama "autobiography," offering a divergent theory of what may have shaped our 44th President's life and politics. In Dreams from My Real Father, Barack Obama is portrayed by a voice-over actor who chronicles Barack Obama's life journey in socialism, from birth through his election to the Presidency. The film begins by presenting the case that Barack Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a Communist Party USA propagandist who likely shaped Obama.

Internet Explorer users have been told to ditch the application and switch to another browser, pronto. The warning comes from Rapid7, which describes a hole that’s exploitable by visiting a malicious Website (and, of course, in the world of Twitter and shortened URLs, it’s so much easier to get users to visit such sites). Visiting a malicious site gives the attacker the same privileges as the current user, according to Rapid7’s post, here. Although the published exploit targets XP, Rapid7 says the attack works on IE 7 through 9 running on XP, Vista and Windows 7. The discoverer of the exploit, Eric Romang, says the zero-day drops a file, Exploit.html, on the target. This, in turn, creates files with img and swf suffixes, which IE treats as Flash. Romang claims the exploit was created by the same group – Nitro – that recently released a Java zero-day into the wild. Rapid7’s HD Moore, also chief architect of Metasploit, told Ars that he’s surprised to see the exploit work across Windows Vista and 7: “This is one of the few times that a vulnerability has been successfully exploited across all the production shipping versions of the browser and OS”, he said. The attack bypasses ASLR – address space layout randomization – that’s meant to help defend the newer operating systems against attack. Microsoft is looking at the exploit now, and has stated that it will “take the necessary steps” once it has a fix ready. ®</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1347977513690</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 10:11:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347978599955-17</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan, disguised as an economist, has only a BA with an econ. minor</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1347939214259</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-17 23:33:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"the belief that formal education trumps informal education".

So...all you noktards &amp; M$hills who said iPhone 5 wouldn't sell..YOU WERE WRONG....AGAIN. You know what's NOT selling???? Windoze phone!! UK RETAILERS have been quick to report staggering demand they have seen for Apple's Iphone 5, calling it the most preordered handset of all time. Both Carphone Warehouse and Phones 4U have told The INQUIRER that the Iphone 5 is the most preordered handset they've ever offered, seeing a 500 percent increase in sales compared to last year's Iphone 4S preorders. Graham Stapleton, chief commercial officer at Carphone Warehouse said, "Last week's preorders for the Iphone 5 smashed all previous handset launches at Carphone Warehouse. It was the most successful week we've ever had online, marking our most successful preorder event ever with website traffic hitting record levels (up 63 [percent] wow). "Perhaps surprisingly, over half of the traffic on the evening of the announcement came via our mobile website with mobile data up nearly 200 [percent] (wow)." Scott Hooton, chief commercial officer at Phones 4U added, "We're staggered by the customer demand for the Iphone 5 since preorder opened on Friday, and have a seen an unbelievable 500 [percent] increase in preorders compared to the Iphone 4s during the same time period. "The Iphone 5 has now officially broken all preorder records at Phones 4U by 71 percent. Time and time again phone manufacturers are pulling out all the stops with new device launches, pushing the boundaries of design and technology, increasing speed and improving camera functions, and genuinely delivering what the customer wants." These statistics don't come as much of a surprise, as analysts had already predicted that the Iphone 5 could sell as many as 10 million units in its first week on sale. Apple has already revealed that the Iphone 5 sold two million units in 24 hours, smashing its previous Iphone sales records. µ</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1347979764090</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 10:49:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347980416694-21</Id><Title>Ballmer: Windoze has no future!!!: Xbox, Not Windows, Is The Future Of M$</Title><Msg>wwwDOTreadwritewebDOTcom/enterprise/2012/09/xbox-not-windows-is-the-future-of-micrsoft-says-steve-ballmer.php We all knew windoze was finished....now ballsup has confirmed it.

More to be gained from open systems than an immature cloud. CIOs looking to replace legacy systems should consider open source options over proprietary software or public cloud services, according to a study by prominent British IT academic, Professor Jim Norton. Norton’s study, released today and commissioned by travel industry processing giant Amadeus, assessed the role of open source software in critical transaction systems. The study was commissioned, Norton told iTnews upon its release, for the benefit of CIOs in the travel and related industries standing on the precipice of replacing legacy, proprietary systems. Airlines and railways in particular have sweated outdated mid-range and mainframe systems for several decades. Inevitably, CIOs at these organisations will need to choose between upgrades, outsourcing or adoption of cloud services. In most cases, Norton argues that re-engineering internal IT using open source software is the more sensible outcome. Why is open source cheaper? Open source software, Norton said, provides enterprise IT with easier access to innovation via a “great global self-re-enforcing community of shared resources, ideas and development". That same community provides a faster response to changes in customer preferences communicated on social networks or via business analytics, and faster resolution of common system problems. Open source is also preferred by the next generation of tech talent, he argues. “The skilled, motivated staff that grew up with the internet don’t want to work with closed, old fashioned systems,” he said. "If you don't provide them with tools for Drupal, for Hadoop, for jQuery, they aren’t happy bunnies." Norton cited studies from the London School of Economics which found that investments to deploy open source in-house drives longer-term savings of 20 percent over the alternatives.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1347980942289</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 11:09:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347980973434-25</Id><Title>phands the phruitcake is the Orly Taitz of software</Title><Msg>yup- MSFT doesnt do 70 billion a year and net 25 billion- Windows doesnt own 92% of the desk top or 75% of the enterprise server market.

The advisory addressed the "zero-day" vulnerability -- meaning it was discovered and exploited before a patch was available -- that was found and disclosed by researcher Eric Romang over the weekend. On Monday, the Metasploit open-source penetration framework published an exploit module for the bug, putting pressure on Microsoft to act quickly. "We have received reports of only a small number of targeted attacks and are working to develop a security update to address this issue," said Yunsun Wee, director of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing group, in a post to the Microsoft Security Response Center blog. All but one supported edition of IE are affected: 2001's IE6, 2006's IE7, 2009's IE8 and last year's IE9. Together, those browsers accounted for 53% of all browsers used worldwide in August. The only exception was IE10, the browser bundled with the new Windows 8, which does not contain the bug.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1347989938264</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 13:38:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347989979431-52</Id><Topic><Title>Reminder there are no customers for business expansion due to Obama / Bernake policy of devaluing dollar, high real inflation, and keeping interest rates artificially low.

Simply stated: Microsoft wants to end any pretense you own the software, while curbing software piracy in the process. Oh yeah, expect to pay more for Office than you do today. For many households or small businesses, that's lots more, particularly if they buy into the Office 365 subscription paradigm. Office 2013 is all about subscription pricing, something Microsoft has attempted several times over the years in pilot form but never really brought to the mass market -- certainly not broadly. The company will continue selling boxed software but the big push is about subscriptions. Hell, I had to dig deep to find retail pricing. Today's pricing announcement pushed Office 365 versions instead. Right, the new subscription bundles. Hidden Price Increases Let's start with the traditional product -- what 2013 versions cost compared to the current offerings (direct from Microsoft Store): Home and Student: $139.99 for 2013; 119.99 for 2010 Home and Business: $219.99; for 2013; $199.99 for 2010 Professional: $399.99 for 2013; 349.99 for 2010 From one perspective, the new versions cost about 10 percent to 16 percent more. However, Microsoft Store prices are for downloads. The 2010 Home and Student sells for $149.99 (up to three PCs); Home and Business, $249.99 (up to two PCs); and Professional, $499.99 (up to two PCs). So from a different perspective, the new pricing is substantially less, except Microsoft takes a way licenses. Like the direct download versions currently available, the 2013 retail replacements come with one license. That works out to a hidden, and quite substantial price increase. License to license: 180 percent increase between Office Home and Student 2010 and 2013 versions and 76 percent for Home and Business. Looked a differently, Microsoft nearly trebles Office Home and Student 2013 for anyone wanting three licenses (from $149.99 to $419.97). For many consumers or small businesses, the ability to install Office on two or more PCs for lower price hugely appeals. Microsoft will let them do that still, if they buy into the subscription model, or one of two Office 365 bundles, which include desktop software and cloud services. Microsoft wants consumers choosing Office 365 Home Premium, for $99 per year per household, and that comes with five Office licenses for Windows or OS X versions. Well, hell, what a bargain, right? That depends. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statics, the average household owns more than one PC but typically not more than three. For many households then, five Office 2013 licenses is two too many.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1347999357944</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 16:15:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347999989805-75</Id><Title>3 cents = bad day tomorrow</Title><Msg>Very disappointing news for MSFT shareholders.

It's no secret that I don't like Windows 8 on new or old desktops. I really thought it might have a shot on tablets though. But at these prices!? Windows RT and 8 on tablets is as dead as a mackerel. I mean seriously. Asus, a mid-range computer vendor, wants $599 for a Nvidia Tegra ARM-powerd Windows RT tablet? The Windows 8 tablet with an Atom processor for $799? Oh, and if you want a keyboard for either one, it will cost you an extra $199!? Come on! My Nexus 7, the best tablet I've found to date, cost me $250. A totally maxed out iPad 3 runs runs $829. I'll take either of those in a New York minute over a Windows 8 tablet at those prices. A friend of mine said the Windows 8 tablet with a keyboard would be worth the price since he could then use it as a full computer. My response to him was: "Isn't that called a laptop?" Actually with an Atom processor at its heart, the question should be: "Isn't that called a netbook?" And can't I get one of those for hundreds less? Why yes, yes I think I can. Besides, with programs such as GotoMyPC you don't need a Windows device to run your Windows applications. They'll run just fine on a less expensive Android tablet or an iPad. And, of course, you can always use a cloud-based office suite like Google Docs on pretty much any device. Leaving aside my dislike for Windows 8, even if this was the best operating system ever, I can't see anyone buying these devices at these prices. They're just too expensive for both consumers and businesses. In a world where Apple has an iron-lock on high-end tablets and Android is securing its place on the mid- and low-ends with devices such as the Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire HD, I don't see anyone wanting to buy a Windows 8 or RT tablet at these price points.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348002088167</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 17:01:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348002309641-79</Id><Topic><Title>What Office 2013 pricing means to you</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1347999357944</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 16:15:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok, so an average household has 3 PC's and your also not including a Cellphone and future Tablet.

People who work all day for low wages and retired people on fixed incomes. Takes a lot of brass to say that. They pay less tax rate, and get a better deal on taxes than the little guy, who pays more per income amount. There is a great misconception out there that paying more money in gives you personally more stock shares in America. It doesn't work that way. You get one share your whole life. The govt takes in a total amount and if your rate is less than the average of others you are paying less than your fair share. Like the soon to be forgotten Miff Romney does. Maybe who really know what he pays. He may pay nothing. That means Miff might have to vote for Obama as he is in the 47%. Romney in un Presidential and I hope they take him off the ticket.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1348015210075</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 20:40:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348016926915-98</Id><Topic><Title>If you make under 22,000 a year making hospital beds</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1348013614022</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 20:13:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And desperate.

On the tape, Romney explains that his electoral strategy involves writing off nearly half the country as unmoveable Obama voters. As Romney explains, 47 percent of Americans "believe that they are victims." He laments: "I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives." So what's the upshot? "My job is not to worry about those people," he says. He also notes, describing President Obama's base, "These are people who pay no income tax. Forty-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax." This is an utter disaster for Romney.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1348024787368</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-18 23:19:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
