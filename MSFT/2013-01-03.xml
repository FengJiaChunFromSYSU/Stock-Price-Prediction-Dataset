I'm all for fairness and if your assertion was true, I'd agree with you. The problem is that the "rich" pay way more than their fair share. A recent study out of the Netherlands ( Leiden Univeristy, I believe) found that Americans who make more than $200,000 per year pay the highest percentage of their income in taxes in the world and get the least benefit for their taxes. In fact, American tax dollars are the most wasted in the world. I hate waste; is it fair that I have to pay for waste (and fraud) when the government does nothing to clean these up? If we are going to be "fair", everyone who earns income should pay at least a nominal amount of taxes so that all have a stake in the game and it isn't in anyone's perceived interest (or at least of no concern to them) to have governmet spening go out of control or that tax dollars be wasted. More importantly, government employees at all levels, from municipal to federal, should have to pay for their own retirement like the rest of us. How "fair" is it that I'm taxed up the woz and am only permitted to defer a small portion of my income to save for my retirement while public employees get a pension that will let them retire with 80% of their last salary or more for life and they don't have to contribute a cent. A "rich" person like me would have to retire with millions upon millions of dollars to have that kind of retirement, but alas, my government does won't permit me to save that much because it's not "fair" for me to do so (never mind that letting me save more would likely reduce my burden on the government and economy when I'm a senior citizen). I should thow in that, in some states--Oregon, for example-- federal and state government employee pensions are not taxed at the state level. How fair is it that some former government employees can retire with a 6 figure income and be exempt from any tax? Shouldn't they pay their "faire" share as well? The pension expense for bureaucrats at both the state and federal level take a signigicant chunk of tax revenue, which is paid by the "rich". Finally, our competent leadership in Congress exempts themselves from all sorts of burdensome government regulations to which I, and my fellow "rich", are subject...and most of those leaders are millionaires (in many cases because of IPOs and other sweet deals that they get in on simply because of they are Senators or Congressman). They get rich off the backs of the taxpayers and then attack people like me, who have earned their money through honest hard work, for not contributing enough to our society. Is that "fair" and are they paying their "fair share"? If you really believe that everyone should pay their fair share and in fundamental fairness, you should be concerned about all of the above facts more than my taxes. Believe me, hon, I already pay my fair share, plus. I fell sorry for people such as you who have drank the Kool-Aid and have actually fallen for Barry's BS that the "rich don't pay their fair share". I'm a financial slave to the government, but you're one in your mind. Get all the facts before you recite the Obozo propaganda.</Msg><Username>doindadorkus</Username><Timestamp>1357231007331</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 11:36:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357232350930-40</Id><Topic><Title>Windows8 may be selling really well: Net Applications Data. 1.64% of 1.5Billion installed base of PCs?</Title><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1357150888996</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-02 13:21:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>acturally, the market share for win 8 on Dec. 31 was 2.8%.

Obama is a great man and his ideas are sensible. This is a fine President of the United States, and should be treated as such. I paid into my retirement just like you, and my employer, a super wealthy private institution, paid 10% matching, how generous of them. I worked for and made most of the money in that account. I always paid taxes fairly and didn't cry about having to help pay for the needs of the poor. What I, and the President as well, refer to are those like Romney and Buffet etc who pay 10-15% tax rates when an average person usually pays 20-25%. It isn't the amount you pay, it is the rate you pay, that determines fairness. Your imagination about those who pay no taxes is standard losing the country GOP talk. A man making 50K working hard as you, with kids and a modest home, may well pay no taxes due to deductions. He still paid taxes in every paycheck and still paid his "entitlements" fees. Retired seniors and miltary protecting you often pay no taxes. There is nothing wrong with that. Take a look at the romney's of the worlds returns. Business expensing and loophole finding are out of control. There's your not paying taxes. Or is it OK for super rich to deduct, but the guy making 50k with kids and expenses, can't deduct? It's you that has beeen bamboozled. Suddenly, in Jan 2009, federal pensions are a problem to you? You must know that has been going on many decades. So why are you blaming Obama for that, anyway? For a 4-5% tax hike on income over 450K you blame him for everything that has existed and much of the most offending elements were put in place by republicans? ObamaCare is a republican idea, especially the mandate part. Now it is a left wing communist problem?</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1357234084563</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-03 12:28:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357234097713-46</Id><Topic><Title>Bought MSFT today.

Any woman who wanted what the Dems were offering is, by definition, not an independent woman, but a government slave. I don't need anyone to pay for my birth control and I don't need the government to protect me. The Dems can keep their free stuff and their condescending "concern" for women.

We are deep in debt because of not enough revenue to fund wars and a #1 military machine, giving the rich uneeded tax cuts, and losing jobs overseas to cheap non union labor.
