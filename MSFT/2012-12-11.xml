Here's a clue, two hundred years ago when people lived in cabins and cleared spots of endless wilderness you could have an idealistic government charter with simple laws and limits on authority. BUT here is the modern issue. 1 Strength comes to those political unions that encompass the largest organized population group. A loose association of states would be similar to the European Union which the conservative proclaims is a certain failure due to its attempt to unify differing cultures ( and of course the irony is missed by them) 2 Neighborhood effects yield problems for the loose association of states. For instance now some states want to legalize cannibus and this creates much pain for neighboring states who do not agree. The end result of the loose association of states in this case is that cannibus legalization will necessarily spread throughout the states whether they want it or not due to enforcement costs. Aw hell that's enough to keep any simple minded rwnj spinning in front of his TV for now.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1355204667881</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 00:44:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355205428862-13</Id><Topic><Title>the simple fact is that the world is vastly more complicated</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1355204667881</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 00:44:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Where you born stupid, or did you educate yourself to be stupid?</Msg><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355205428862</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 00:57:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355205468956-14</Id><Topic><Title>the simple fact is that the world is vastly more complicated</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1355204667881</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 00:44:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is what public education gets you!</Msg><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355205468956</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 00:57:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355224809183-15</Id><Topic><Title>We Want A Special Dividend!</Title><Username>fairz3</Username><Timestamp>1355196104799</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-10 22:21:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>stock buybacks are the best, and i want to cut down the share counts by 10%, and if this is not possible, then special divi!

Soft kill drugs in the pretext of protection is the common theme for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Cheap, effective contraceptive and HIV pharmaceuticals are now the objectives soon to target the third world. A University of Washington team has developed a platform they say simultaneously offers contraception and prevents HIV. Electrically spun cloth with nanometer-sized fibers can dissolve to release drugs, providing a platform for cheap medical use. The research was published this week in the Public Library of Science’s open-access journal PLoS One. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation last month awarded the UW researchers almost $1 million to pursue the technology. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has committed 10 billion dollars over the next ten years to make it the most aggressive decade ever to roll out new vaccines to poor nations around the world. The commitmentwill also effectively create widespread fertility problems across vaccinated populations. Bill Gates told a recent TED conference, an organization which is sponsored by one of the largest toxic waste polluters on the planet, that vaccines need to be used to reduce world population figures in order to solve global warming and lower CO2 emissions.</Msg><Username>vernnimble</Username><Timestamp>1355244530709</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 11:48:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355245520810-52</Id><Topic><Title>Here is what YOUR Microsoft money buys</Title><Username>vernnimble</Username><Timestamp>1355244530709</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 11:48:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Bill Gates told a recent TED conference, an organization which is sponsored by one of the largest toxic waste polluters on the planet, that vaccines need to be used to reduce world population figures in order to solve global warming and lower CO2 emissions."

Concentrations of wealth = concentrations of power and the hands of the few.

The world's largest software company, which alone has sold the Surface since launch in late October, also said it was keeping its chain of 'pop-up' holiday stores open into the new year and may convert them into permanent retail outlets. The move suggests Microsoft is seeing some demand for its first own-brand computer in the crucial holiday shopping season, although it has yet to divulge any sales figures. "The public reaction to Surface has been exciting to see," said Panos Panay, general manager of Microsoft's Surface project, which forms part of the company's Windows unit. "We've increased production and are expanding the ways in which customers can interact with, experience and purchase Surface," said Panay, but gave no details of how many extra units were being produced. Panay did not mention names of retailers that will sell the Surface, but separately office equipment retailer Staples Inc said it would stock the Surface from Wednesday.</Msg><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1355262014496</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 16:40:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355262252559-91</Id><Topic><Title>Thanks Mr Ballmer &amp; Microsoft &amp; The Silverlight Team</Title><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1355259136658</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 15:52:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I use a laptop without a touch screen also.

(MSFT) said it has boosted the production of its Surface RT tablet computer and will make the device available at more retail stores. Staples Inc. (SPLS) and Best Buy Co. (BBY) will start sales tomorrow. Customers will be able to buy the Surface running Windows RT software, an update to the company’s flagship operating system, at an expanded list of retail stores in the U.S. and Australia “as early as mid-December,” Microsoft said today in a statement. The Redmond, Washington-based company also will extend its Microsoft holiday stores, including turning some of the temporary outlets into permanent ones. Microsoft has been selling the devices since Oct. 26 only at its more than 60 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada, and online in seven countries. The company has declined to provide sales numbers, leading some analysts to express concern demand might be falling short. Best Buy said it will offer Surface tablets online from tomorrow, and in some retail outlets starting Dec. 16. With the added distribution, Microsoft should sell about a million units this quarter, according to Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc. Additional retailers will be added in “a number of countries in the coming months,” Microsoft said in the statement. The company didn’t elaborate or say how much it expanded production. Microsoft said last month that it will introduce a new model of the device, the Surface Pro, in January. That device features an Intel Corp. (INTC) i5 processor. Microsoft may release a version with Intel’s Clover Trail chip, which would offer better battery life and performance, “perhaps by March,” Sherlund said.</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1355278329910</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 21:12:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355278740865-106</Id><Topic><Title>WE LOST OUR COUNTRY TO MINORITIES.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1352352551894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 00:29:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>/giggle</Msg><Username>aurin_res</Username><Timestamp>1355278740865</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 21:19:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355279526890-107</Id><Topic><Title>WIN 8 IS GOING...</Title><Username>nk499</Username><Timestamp>1350621518116</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 00:38:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>/giggle</Msg><Username>aurin_res</Username><Timestamp>1355279526890</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 21:32:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355281687324-108</Id><Title>Microsoft's worst nightmare....</Title><Msg>Apple's product all sold out!!!</Msg><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355281687324</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 22:08:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355281936095-109</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's worst nightmare....</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1355281687324</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 22:08:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL.....unfortunately you would be correct!!</Msg><Username>bill_california_paseo</Username><Timestamp>1355281936095</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-11 22:12:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355282598249-110</Id><Topic><Title>WIN 8 IS GOING...</Title><Username>nk499</Username><Timestamp>1350621518116</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-19 00:38:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have 6 home computers, but I will not install Windows 8 on any of them.
