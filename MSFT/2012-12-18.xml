NOne! I don't just buy into the company and hope. On top of the usual msft software business that continues to dominates yet non-exciting, msft has window 8 that allows the marriage of touchpad to laptops. In addition to software, the company now is on full force to develop hardwares such as phones and the first ever laptop/touchpads which by the way is selling like pancakes. This reminds me of when apple came up with touchpads which casted many doubts. If you doubt how well surface is selling just visit a msft store and see for yourself; this product is amazing. It makes the ipads look like a thing of the past. The sells numbers will be in for the earnings; this one is gonna shock everyone.</Msg><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1355807064895</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 00:04:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355807065724-4</Id><Topic><Title>Is Obama's divisiveness responsible?</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1355760936398</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 11:15:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tea party and hate spewed by right wing is to blame...</Msg><Username>chacista</Username><Timestamp>1355807065724</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 00:04:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355807320062-5</Id><Topic><Title>Double bagger after January earnings</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1355776270727</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-17 15:31:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the reason of mini ipads is because with similar pricing of surface, the original ipads wouldn't be able to compete with surface.

That seems WAAAAAYYYY too unlikely to be a coincidence. How many people have EVER testified before the Senate? How many people have EVER been the father of a school shooter? How many people would be qualified to testify in this ONE case? The odds would have to be BILLIONS to one - maybe TRILLIONS - much like 108 percent of the vote in some counties going for one candidate without a SINGLE vote going for the other. Surely the left wouldn't stage something this hideous and evil to promote their gun-control policies - would they? - but it sure didn't take long for Obama to step to the mike with his teleprompter speech ready to go, did it? With Obama's executive orders to allow him to use the military against the American public preceding all of this it has to make you wonder - or at least anyone who is awake would have to wonder. HITLER did extremely evil things to his own people. Let's hope we are not witnessing another evil narcissist in action - but let's not be asleep at the wheel if we are.

The son busted the door of a cabinet to get to the guns then bought the ammo. Guns are sold at flee markets too-really old ones. This wife should have been more wise and put the guns in a case where they couldn't get to them alone. This is only the partial reason this happened. The other part is he wanted to put an end to his past as it haunted him in his memories. The only way he knew how to do that was to go back to that exact location where he experienced it and destroy it. It was a compulsive anger reaction. Please stop talking about the NRA and it is at fault. Storage of the guns and the brain behind the trigger are the real reasons. These guns shouldn't have been located at the house but rather at the range and this wouldn't have happened-maybe.

Warren Burger was a conservative Republican, appointed U.S. chief justice by President Richard Nixon in 1969. In a speech in 1992, six years after his retirement from the court, Burger declared that “the Second Amendment doesn’t guarantee the right to have firearms at all.” In his view, the purpose of the Second Amendment was only “to ensure that the ‘state armies’ -- ‘the militia’ -- would be maintained for the defense of the state.” A year before, Burger went even further. On “MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour,” Burger said the Second Amendment “has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud -- I repeat the word ‘fraud’ -- on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.” Burger wasn’t in the habit of taking stands on controversial constitutional questions on national television. In using the word “fraud,” Burger meant to describe what he saw as a clear consensus about the meaning of the Constitution. To understand what Burger was thinking, consider the words of the Second Amendment: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.”</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1355869586265</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 17:26:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355871589368-61</Id><Topic><Title>I can see 30</Title><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1355852597312</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 12:43:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as win8 and wp8 utterly fail to sell.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1355871589368</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 17:59:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355874065610-62</Id><Title>Dividend increase plan!

Benefit: Paper capital remains in circulation. Securities jobs created with the paper capital. Research and development jobs created with the remaining paper capital. Retaining paper capital allows for national companies to remain competitive in the global marketplace. Remaining competitive is critical when competing against Government financed firms. In addition, as jobs are created additional payroll taxes are collected. As more payroll taxes are collected the amount of capital the Government has to expend increases; leading to lower tax ideas. Finally the Government as well as the taxpayers will receive “Good payback” with an all stock settlement each quarter to the treasury.</Msg><Username>nickinil</Username><Timestamp>1355874065610</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 18:41:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355874567688-63</Id><Title>with regard to the economy an issue i have noticed.</Title><Msg>If you have your house paid for and maybe a vehicle or two it is surprisingly easy to get by working part time.

Micrsoft is expected to earn $2.95 in the same fiscal year endin in June 2013. Using same PE ratio MSFT should be at 37. But MSFT has $6 more net cash per share compared to ORCL. So MSFT should be at 43. Conservatively MSFT is a 40 dollar stock. MSFT's growth over the last three years and next three years is higher than ORCL and MSFT is a more diversified franchise.</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1355879194309</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 20:06:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355881452048-72</Id><Topic><Title>California State Teacher's Retirement fund owns 6.67% of the Company owning Bushmaster .223</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1355872020850</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-18 18:07:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Past tense.
