And the Musllim does all 3 with impunity. And as far as the Kenyan's Commie Care goes, the upward revision of the extra cost of $3,500 that the CBO came out with is an extremely conservative figure, we all know it will be MUCH higher than that and not just in the monetary mode either, but in a cost that's much more important and that's in a too high of a cost to American's FREEDOM over their own bodies. The commies rag about WOMEN not having control over THEIR OWN bodies and not being able to make their own decisions when in fact "NO ONE" will have control over THEIR bodies if the spawn of darkness Musllim monkey is allowed to implement his diabolical Commie Care Control. Out of the 2,700 some odd pages of the Kenyan's insane anti American bogus bill, only about a half a sentence has to do with anything even remotely resembling health care, the rest is all about politburo panel commie control. It's just as simple as that and the people who don't figure that out will be the ones that whine and complain the loudest when it detrimentally affects THEM, after it's too late for the ignorant ignoramuses of course.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351423074185</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 07:17:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351424190172-16</Id><Title>Hillary nominated Christopher Stevens and Hussein appointed him and then sent him</Title><Msg>.... to Benghazi and not only didn't they give the Ambassador any real security to speak of, when he called for HELP at 3 O'clock in the morning because of the TERRORIST ATTACK, Hussein AND Hillary BOTH ignored his cries for help as they watched the 4 Americans die on closed circuit tv and due to political expediency, DID F HUCKING NOTHING other than eat popcorn and laugh it up and then hurried off to VEGAS.

News Senior Political Reporter Romney in Pensacola, Fla (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) LAND O'LAKES, Fla.—Mitt Romney won a major newspaper endorsement on Saturday, as the Des Moines Register's editorial board formally backed the GOP candidate's bid for the presidency. It was the first time in 40 years the influential battleground state paper endorsed a Republican in the general election, dating back to its support of Richard Nixon in the 1972 election. The Register previously backed Romney in the 2012 GOP primary. In an editorial published on the newspaper's website Saturday night, the Register called both Romney and President Barack Obama "superbly qualified," citing their service in government and the fact they are both "devoted husbands and fathers." But according to the paper, it determined Romney was better positioned to "forge the compromises in Congress" necessary to turn the economy around, create jobs and get the federal budget back on track. "Romney has made rebuilding the economy his No. 1 campaign priority--and rightly so," the Register's editorial read. At the same time, the paper noted Obama's "best efforts to resuscitate the stumbling economy have fallen short." "Nothing indicates it would change with a second term in the White House," the paper said. "Barack Obama rocketed to the presidency from relative obscurity with a theme of hope and change. A different reality has marked his presidency. His record on the economy the past four years does not suggest he would lead in the direction the nation must go in the next four years." The Register noted that Romney is likely to face the same kind of political opposition that has challenged Obama's first term agenda. But the paper expressed hope that Romney might be able to forge the same kind of alliances that helped him govern as a Republican in Massachusetts. "Voters should give Mitt Romney a chance to correct the nation's fiscal course and to implode the partisan gridlock that has shackled Washington and the rest of America--with the understanding that he would face the same assessment in four years if he does not succeed," the paper wrote. It's unclear how the Register's support will influence the race in Iowa, where polls have found Romney and Obama in a statistical dead heat. Romney scheduled to campaign in the state Monday. He spent two days in the state earlier this week.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351429152458</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 08:59:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351429471925-23</Id><Topic><Title>How is ANYONE able to ignore the 800lb Benghazi-Gate Gorilla in the Oval office?</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351428757662</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 08:52:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Awesome news, Atomic-Q!!

The president did not give a yes-or-no answer Friday when asked pointedly whether the Americans under attack in Benghazi, Libya, were denied requests for help during the attack. Fox News has also learned that a request from the CIA annex for backup was later denied. “The election has nothing to do with the four brave Americans getting killed and us wanting to find out exactly what happened,” the president said in TV interview with an NBC affiliate in Colorado. When asked again, Obama said, “The minute I found out what was going on, I gave three very clear directives -- Number 1, make sure that we are securing our personnel and doing whatever we need to.” The first attack occurred at the American consulate in Benghazi, killing U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and U.S. diplomat Sean Smith. Former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods was part of a small team that was at the CIA annex about a mile from the consulate when it came under attack. Upon hearing shots fired, team members asked higher-ups at the annex if they could go the consulate. However, they were told to "stand down," according to sources familiar with the exchange. Woods and at least two others ignored those orders and went to the consulate, evacuating survivors and Smith, who had been killed in the initial attack. They could not find the ambassador and returned to the CIA annex at about midnight. At that point, they called again for military support and help because they were taking fire at the CIA safe house, or annex. The request was denied. Woods and fellow former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty were killed at the annex by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. The CIA and Defense Department have denied claims about requests for support being rejected. "The agency reacted quickly to aid our colleagues during that terrible evening in Benghazi," said CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood. "Moreover, no one at any level in the CIA told anybody not to help those in need. Claims to the contrary are simply inaccurate.” Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said there was not a clear enough picture of what was occurring on the ground in Benghazi to send help. "There's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking going on here," he said Thursday. "But the basic principle here ... is that you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on." Obama also said in the TV interview, as he said previously said, the administration is going to “investigate what happened to make sure it never happens again” and find out who was involved in the attack so they can be brought to justice. “I guarantee you that everybody in the State Department, our military, CIA, you name it, have a No.1 priority making sure that people are safe. These are our folks. And we're going to find out exactly what happened but what we're also going to do is make sure that we are identify those who carried out these terrible attacks,” the president said.

Isn't that the point of a keyboard? I think the wizards at msft were so behind the curve on mobile that they think we want our desktops mobile. On a tablet or phone, you use the touch screen out of necessity, not desire. Those with greater need add a keyboard to tablets.

Anyone know exactly where? Was he also trying to help? GEN Ham attended the Naval War College; he must have known RADM Gaouette, if not personally they would at least have been at conferences etc. together. Two flag officers operating in the same theater, relieved or at least reassigned in the same week. With questionable actions or inactions by POTUS, less than two weeks before the election.

The Register's editorial board said it engaged in a "vigorous debate" over whom to endorse this election. Ultimately, the newspaper that hasn't backed a Republican since Richard Nixon in 1972, decided to throw its weight behind the Republican nominee. Central to the editorial board's decision is who has a better chance of working with Congress. "When the question is framed in those terms, Mitt Romney emerges the stronger candidate," the editorial board wrote. They cautioned Romney, however, on "wasting time on issues that animate many in his party." The Cedar Rapids Gazette's editorial board said President Obama "made his mark during his historic first term" with passage of the health care law, reforms to the financial sector and investments in green energy, but they say the president has "come up short" on the economy and debt. Simply put, the Quad City Times' editorial board wrote, "We invested heavily in hope back in 2008. Our 2012 endorsement of Mitt Romney comes with an imperative for change." The Sioux City Journal editorial board offered a similar assessment: "We are neither satisfied nor confident. In our view, change is needed." Romney also received the endorsements of a couple of Ohio newspapers this weekend, including the Cincinnati Enquirer. "This is a precarious time for America. We'd expect a President Romney to lead toward the center, to resist the calls for a hard turn to the right that are sure to come from within his party," they wrote. Mr. Obama picked up the endorsement of an Ohio newspaper as well. The Toledo Blade editorial board wrote that "the choice between the candidates is clear and momentous." However, they offered a measured assessment of the president, saying he has said "too little" about entitlement reform, climate change, oil and gas production, gun control and mass incarceration. "But Mr. Romney's prescriptions on such matters, to the extent he has any, are worse." Newspapers elsewhere also threw their support behind the president this weekend. The Detroit Free Press editorial board called Mr. Obama's record "stunning." They pointed to the auto bailout, the Affordable Care Act health care law and the end of the war in Iraq and the near end of the war in Afghanistan. "Romney has been a shape-shifter, his message twisting and reconfiguring itself to fit the needs of the moment," the editorial board wrote about the Republican who was born in Michigan and whose father was governor there five decades ago. The president received the backing of major newspapers in the battleground states of North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The Raleigh News and Observer editorial board wrote that "the president has accomplished much in his first term" and that he would continue to fight for the middle class. "There will be no stimulus money for jobs, regulations will be cut back severely on the environment and Wall Street (where the recession was hatched due to loose rules in the first place) and, of course, the well-to-do will be showered with tax cuts," the editorial board at the Pittsburgh Post Gazette wrote. "Because we still hope, we endorse for president Barack Obama, whose heart -- unlike his challenger -- has not wavered nor his principles changed."</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1351465681745</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:08:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351465750311-107</Id><Topic><Title>Information On Benghazi</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1351436118922</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 10:55:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>President Obama declined to answer directly whether a CIA annex was denied urgent requests for military assistance during the deadly attacks last month on U.S. outposts in Libya. The president did not give a yes-or-no answer Friday when asked pointedly whether the Americans under attack in Benghazi, Libya, were denied requests for help during the attack. Fox News has also learned that a request from the CIA annex for backup was later denied. “The election has nothing to do with the four brave Americans getting killed and us wanting to find out exactly what happened,” the president said in TV interview with an NBC affiliate in Colorado. When asked again, Obama said, “The minute I found out what was going on, I gave three very clear directives -- Number 1, make sure that we are securing our personnel and doing whatever we need to.” The first attack occurred at the American consulate in Benghazi, killing U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and U.S. diplomat Sean Smith. Former Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods was part of a small team that was at the CIA annex about a mile from the consulate when it came under attack. Upon hearing shots fired, team members asked higher-ups at the annex if they could go the consulate. However, they were told to "stand down," according to sources familiar with the exchange. Woods and at least two others ignored those orders and went to the consulate, evacuating survivors and Smith, who had been killed in the initial attack. They could not find the ambassador and returned to the CIA annex at about midnight. At that point, they called again for military support and help because they were taking fire at the CIA safe house, or annex. The request was denied. Woods and fellow former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty were killed at the annex by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. The CIA and Defense Department have denied claims about requests for support being rejected. "The agency reacted quickly to aid our colleagues during that terrible evening in Benghazi," said CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood. "Moreover, no one at any level in the CIA told anybody not to help those in need. Claims to the contrary are simply inaccurate.” Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said there was not a clear enough picture of what was occurring on the ground in Benghazi to send help. "There's a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking going on here," he said Thursday. "But the basic principle here ... is that you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on." Obama also said in the TV interview, as he said previously said, the administration is going to “investigate what happened to make sure it never happens again” and find out who was involved in the attack so they can be brought to justice. “I guarantee you that everybody in the State Department, our military, CIA, you name it, have a No.1 priority making sure that people are safe. These are our folks. And we're going to find out exactly what happened but what we're also going to do is make sure that we are identify those who carried out these terrible attacks,” the president said.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1351465750311</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:09:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351465857011-108</Id><Title>The blood thirsty Musllim is politicizing Benghazi-Gate</Title><Msg>.... because all he would have to do is tell everyone what they already know and that's that he is responsible for 4 DEAD AMERICANS as he watched them die in real time on closed circuit big screen television and then decided to try and cover it up and fabricated some cawk n bull story about some video insulting his prophet Mu'hammed.

Enright has denied a motion for a temporary restraining order against Dinesh D'Souza, director of the blockbuster film 2016: Obama's America. The motion had been filed by one of the film's producers Douglas Sain. Noting that the application before the court was "vague, lacks specificity, and do not seek to enjoin a particular act," the judge agreed with D'Souza's request that the matter be resolved in arbitration, as called for in their original contract. Sain's allegations were made after he attempted to renegotiate his compensation to $1.2mm, to be paid ahead of the film's investors in addition to his share of the profits and D'Souza refused. Sain, a minority owner of the company behind the film and a producer was terminated after making the compensation request. Alert: Obama Movie Exposes His Vision for America. Click here. "I'm used to hearing Obama make exaggerations about "fair share" but this request was over the top," said D'Souza. "Our film has broken box office records, becoming the second most successful political documentary of all time, and the fourth highest grossing documentary on any subject. The film is now in DVD, home box office, and video on demand from Lionsgate. We should be breaking out the champagne. I'm disappointed that Mr. Sain took these unwarranted actions and made flagrant and untrue accusations against me, but I look forward to having an unbiased third party help us resolve his issues in the place it should have been all along, which is called for in our agreement: arbitration." Producer Gerald Moen also noted, "I am totally appalled by the actions of Mr. Sain. His demands at a crucial time of the release of the film were not only untimely but unprofessional in practice and out of line as a matter of conduct."</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1351465942992</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:12:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351466046934-111</Id><Title>BOYS ..you better SELL..WINDOWS 8 really is AWFUL...no kidding....</Title><Msg>and ZERO business use........</Msg><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1351466046934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:14:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351466110624-112</Id><Topic><Title>BOYS ..you better SELL..WINDOWS 8 really is AWFUL...no kidding....</Title><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1351466046934</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:14:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I "WAS" hoping for a "WINNER" too.......</Msg><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1351466110624</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 19:15:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351466523090-113</Id><Topic><Title>Have any Surfaces sold?</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1351389213473</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 21:53:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is the iPad mini the one available the same day as the Surface?

That was the beginning of the end.] Actually, FDR confiscated gold coins and bullion only. Gold numismatic coins, jewellery and art were exempt. One could also ship their gold overseas for storage. Nice loophole for the wealthy. As for the "beginning of the end", that would be the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 followed by Nixon fifty-eight years later when he dumped the gold standard. Then, Ronald Reagan sealed the deal to bury the middle class when he sold "trickle-down" economics to the #$%$. Any chart of the history of the U.S public debt clearly shows a reversal in the downward trend of the debt beginning in 1981.

After spending a weekend with the Surface Tablet, it's clear that Windows 8 is a disaster that will make Vista look like a huge success. It is totally confusing to use, uglier than sin, and Metro is really just a shell over the OS. On Surface, the icons to change network preferences are tiny. The "Start" menu launches the horrible Metro UI. Metro shows your emails including junk emails where anyone can see them. I used a dummy Hotmail account &amp; it shows links to p0rn websites and Viagra ads. It's really shocking how bad this OS looks, acts and works. No JAVA or Flash support either. For HLS streaming to the iPad, that's fine. The "tube" adult websites have been modified to support the iPad / iOS. I really doubt they will create and re-encode their entire libraries for Surface. M$FT copied things on iOS without understanding _why_ Apple removed Flash and JAVA support outside of compiled apps.

Hussein is a lying Kenyan coward and he doesn't mind being one because he's pure e vill. Geraldo told Mr. Woods that some big wig military guy told him that they did all they could. And Mr. Woods said to the it e it boot licker Geraldo, Bengazi is several thousand miles away and the American consulate is AMERICAN SOIL and Obamma DID NOTHING TO HELP THEM and then he said to Geraldo, if the attack was in California, it being several thousand miles away, would he have sent help to them? And Geraldo just stared at him with his usual deer in the headlight's confused look. Geraldo is doing all he can to assist the Musllim in his cover-up too as he tried to run interference for him by saying that "someone" from the military told him they did all they could and would he, Mr. Woods, now apologize for saying that "Mr. Obamma is a murderer." That mysterious military guy just told a f hucking FLAT OUT LIE because like the brain dead Musllim Monkey said to Romney, "we have big ships that planes land on" and by the same token, we also have F-16's that could have been scrambled and struck that she it hole Benghazi in a New York MINUTE. AND THEY HAD 7 HOURS TO DO IT, THEY COULD HAVE FLOWN AROUND THE WORLD 200,000,000 TIMES IN 7 HOURS. So that "big wig military guy" that Geraldo was allegedly talking to was a lying piece of anti American she it too like his lying Musllim Messiah.

Think about this. If Microsoft can sell 3M to 5M Surface this quarter that is 1.8Billion to 3Billion on Hardware sales that didn't exist before. Next year it could add some 15Billion of new revenue if MSFT grabs just 20% of tablet market share</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1351479271410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 22:54:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351479500673-162</Id><Title>D i'l,d'o thinks 4 KIA's in Bengahzi is worse than 4000 KIA's in Iraq---hey its ok just a littl puke electioneering</Title><Msg>We never heard a peep out of him while the Iraq war was going on</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351479500673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 22:58:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351482115513-163</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Surface - blowout sales and its impact</Title><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1351479271410</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 22:54:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here is why Surface + Other Windows 8 Tablet will grab bigger than 20% market share. 1. ipad and android is mostly half cook OS. True OS is work with all different input interface. Microsoft Windows 8 and Microsoft Windows 8 RT both support Keyboard, Mouse, Touch screen and have mode to use it effiecient way. 2. App count is seems disadvantage but most of current Windows 8 App can easily converted to RT supported in atleast Desktop mode. It actually advantage ( Getting full feature apps on your tablet is much better option.) 3. Corporate market will move forward faster with Windows 8 since most employee like to move to more mobility and feel outdated and so lot more revenue with upgrade. 4. Windows 8 Phone /RT/ Tablet all use same base code and share most of API and so easier to write and support all three platform for developer.</Msg><Username>vs1234gs</Username><Timestamp>1351482115513</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 23:41:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
