Looking ahead to 2013, it sees Apple overhauling iOS following a bumpy 2012, Google battling with Samsung over Android's future, and Microsoft, Sony, and perhaps Valve trying to invigorate a slumping console gaming industry.</Msg><Username>davidanderson916</Username><Timestamp>1357019447379</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 00:50:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357019890929-2</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Is The Greatest President Since Lincoln</Title><Username>lordbalzy_nation</Username><Timestamp>1357001346302</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 19:49:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OBAMA IS GREAT PRESIDENT FOR TAKERS.</Msg><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1357019890929</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 00:58:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357020058199-3</Id><Title>OBAMA IS GREAT PRESIDENT FOR TAKERS, HORRIBLE PRESIDENT FOR MAKERS.</Title><Msg>TAKERS LOVE HIM, MAKERS HATE HIM.</Msg><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1357020058199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 01:00:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>14</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357020182759-4</Id><Title>MAKERS LOVE AMERICA, TAKERS LOVE OBAMA.</Title><Msg>THE SOCIALISTS WILL BE DEFEATED BY MAKERS.</Msg><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1357020182759</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 01:03:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357022862536-5</Id><Topic><Title>MAKERS LOVE AMERICA, TAKERS LOVE OBAMA.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1357020182759</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 01:03:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>way to go|!!</Msg><Username>bill_reads_palms</Username><Timestamp>1357022862536</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 01:47:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357029834903-6</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA IS GREAT PRESIDENT FOR TAKERS, HORRIBLE PRESIDENT FOR MAKERS.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1357020058199</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 01:00:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama wants to be remembered as a Robin Hood to the American people.

That's why a connection to a website is called an app. And so ARM tablets mostly go to websites designed for mobile phones. But a tablet with an Atom processor can go to any website but can also run desktop applications. Here are some Atom tablets: HP Elite Pad 900 Lenovo ThinkPad 2 Samsung ATIV 500T The Samsung ATIV 500T has both WiFi and ethernet connection. The Lenovo ThinkPad 2 has WiFi and USB. The Elite Pad 900 has WiFi while USB is included with the "smart jacket". Then the Elite Pad 900 also offers a "productivity jacket".

The only issue was Mobile phone and Tablet OS. With 40M win8 sold in 30days and lkely having sold over 80M+ as of Dec 31st; and likely having sold 2M Surface RT, Windows division may be on a rapid new growth phase. We know Windows phone is growing gangbusters and It is possible it will grab 5% to 10% of entire mobile phone market share next year that is a dramtic growth something like 289% this year and may be 200-300% next year. That is a hyper growth start up like growth</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1357102201910</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 23:50:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357102568337-44</Id><Topic><Title>Microsofts EPS grew 200%+ in the last ten years and still growing</Title><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1357102201910</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 23:50:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If anything you said were true, you'd have a point.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1357102568337</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-01 23:56:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
