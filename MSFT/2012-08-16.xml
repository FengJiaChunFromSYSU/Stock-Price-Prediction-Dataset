Now that the consequences of the debt run up during the Bush / Cheney / Hastert / Frist reign of error are clear they're your personal liability. You'll just have to be "austere" in order for arrogant overcompensated nit-wits to continue in their lavish, self-indulgent lifestyles.

It is not every day investors have the opportunity to get the best of the Old and New Worlds: capitalize on a strong U.S. Dollar by buying a Euro-based multinational company with impressive financials. Falken Industries Ltd. (FLKI) is a leading global manufacturer and commercialization of high-end specialty cleaning products for industrial, professional and consumer uses. Under its brand name Clean Plus, Falken Industries has successfully launched more than 160 professional and consumer auto care products which are sold in over a dozen international markets, including recently signed Australia and Russia. Clean Plus products are currently available in over 1000 petrol stations and other outlets throughout Europe. Key Investor Points Falken Industries sales volumes have more than doubled over the past two years, with continued record growth. Q1 2012 revenues increased 30% over Q4 2011 along with record profits. Q2 is even more remarkable: net operating revenues even after unfavorable net currency adjustments to the strong dollar increased 34% from the year-ago quarter while net operating margins were up 17% to 45% Profits (PPS) were a solid 2 cents per share on an annualized basis. The company is experiencing rapid expansion, including recent signed agreements with distributors in Norway, Australia, and Russia. Falken Industries supplies the global markets of major petrol distributors, including Shell, BP, Esso, Q8, Statoil, Hydro-Texaco, Olis, Agip, and Cepsa. Why Now? Despite record impressive performance and profits, Falcon Industries is trading at a heavy discount: 30% of its book value. This anomaly is largely due to the current economic downturn in Europe, which has affected exchange rates between the Dollar and Despite record impressive performance and profits, Falcon Industries is trading at a heavy discount: 30% of its book value. This anomaly is largely due to the current economic downturn in Europe, which has affected exchange rates between the Dollar and the Euro. Since the company’s financial reports are primarily denominated in Euro, the monetary figures are artificially diminished as a consequence of U.S. Dollar reporting. This has fueled exaggerated fears resulting in a heavily-discounted PPS, despite strong fundamentals. This temporary fluctuation is expected to be corrected as the currency markets stabilize. In the meantime, Falken management has responded with initiatives designed to capitalize on the weaker Euro and stronger Dollar by expanding into U.S. and Canadian markets. The trade-off is huge, offsetting by far any currency conversion loss. It is only a matter of time before the stock begins to reflect the fact that its products have up to a 50% price advantage over competitors. All this presents a unique opportunity for investors to buy at an artificially low PPS before the inevitable adjustment of the currency exchange rates reveals the true strengths of this rapidly growing company.</Msg><Username>flytrysk</Username><Timestamp>1345132063000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:47:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345132192000-15</Id><Topic><Title>Check it out, Microsoft: best of both worlds</Title><Username>flytrysk</Username><Timestamp>1345132063000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:47:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>interesting - are the products sold in the US as well?</Msg><Username>tradzw</Username><Timestamp>1345132192000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 11:49:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345137116000-16</Id><Title>Bullish trend spotted on Microsoft Corporation</Title><Msg>Microsoft Corporation looks to be oversold right now, thought? http://STOCKMARKETAFTERHOURS.INFO</Msg><Username>feleciaringlein</Username><Timestamp>1345137116000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 13:11:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345139845000-17</Id><Title>A newer, smarter way to trade!

A focus on disruptive trends in technology. 8/16/2012 @ 5:39PM |1,084 views The Battle to Become "The Linux of the Cloud" In the business world, money has long been the dominant success benchmark. A hundred years ago being a millionaire was enough, today it’s about being a billionaire. In open source software however, things are a bit different. Success is often defined not only by how much money is made, but instead by a company or project’s level of community contribution, involvement and participation. The gold standard for this type of success has long been the Linux Operating system. Recently there has been an increased use of software companies attempting to position themselves using Linux as an analogy within a particular software vertical. Essentially these companies are claiming to be “The Linux of an industry.” A prime example of this is the once proprietary focused VMware announcing a recent update to it’s open source CloudFound project. CTO Steve Herrod said, not once but twice, that VMware wants to be the “Linux of the Cloud” and that the company realizes that developers require an open source platform to develop the new generation of applications. An interesting maneuver given the company generates the majority of its revenue selling traditional “closed source” licensed software. Yet another example came about earlier this month when San Antonio, TX based web hosting provider Rackspace, unveiled its rebranding effort as “The Open Cloud Company.” This move builds on the momentum they have seen with their OpenStack project, which many in the industry have been calling “The Linux of the Cloud” I had the opportunity to speak with Jim Zemlin, Executive Director at the Linux Foundation, for his insights into this phenomenon. During our lengthy conversation, he told me that this trend has to do with the success that Linux has had over the last 20 years. Twenty years ago, Linux, as well as others in the industry, strived to become the Microsoft of a particular area. Today companies are striving to become the so-called “Linux of technology” because of the unprecedented level of impact Linux has had on almost all parts of the modern technology landscape.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345174610000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 23:36:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
