But there's also bad news for Redmond in the review, as the first of its five instalments drops this little bomb: “We recently did a large field research study and specifically asked all of our interviewees if they were looking at Windows 8, most laughed. The fact is most enterprises are still trying to get to Windows 7 and few enterprises are ready for Windows 8.” There's another nasty lurking in the third chapter, wherein Berger asks “What is the experience like on Windows 8 when the end point isn’t touch enabled?” His answer: “In a word: Bad.” Berger's justification for that assessment is that “Extremely important menus in Windows 8 are hidden off screen, easily brought in when using a touch and swiping with your thumbs, are absent when using a mouse … Prior to this incident, I can’t tell you the last time I had to ask someone how to do something in a client OS.” http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/07/23/gartner_windows_8_review/</Msg><Username>manyhats23</Username><Timestamp>1343040463000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 06:47:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343043956000-7</Id><Title>Down 1.79% in Pre Market</Title><Msg>Let the SELLOFF begin!!!

In an interview with CRN at Microsoft's annual Worldwide Partner Conference in Toronto, Ballmer vowed: "We are trying to make absolutely clear we are not going to leave any space uncovered to Apple. We are not. No space uncovered that is Apple's." He then pointed out a number of advantages that Microsoft has over Apple, including enterprise management and server structure in the enterprise. Those advantages, of course, have nothing to do with the areas where Apple has the big advantage over Microsoft, consumer smartphones and tablets. To make his point clear that he intends to challenge Apple there as well, he shouted: "But we are not going to let any piece of this [go uncontested to Apple]. Not the consumer cloud. Not hardware-software innovation. We are not leaving any of that to Apple by itself. Not going to happen. Not on our watch." Someone might want to point out to Ballmer that it's essentially already happened, and on his watch. During his tenure, Apple launched the iPhone and the iPad, and has dominated mobile computing, while Microsoft has been left behind. And also, some time on his watch, the total number of Apple devices, including iPhones and iPads, will likely outsell the total number of Windows devices. The likelihood of Microsoft catching Apple in mobile are very slim, no matter what Ballmer shouts. Ballmer's bluster is part of his shtick, and people have learned to discount it. But it's getting to be old. Microsoft doesn't need a blustery leader to lead it into the uncertain mobile market, it needs one with a clear vision. And all the shouting Ballmer does won't change that.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343064428000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 13:27:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343064754000-34</Id><Title>Went long 600 Aug 30 Calls</Title><Msg>Expect MSFT to move up if the broader market moves up...</Msg><Username>picker.bottom</Username><Timestamp>1343064754000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 13:32:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343066630000-35</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT site or politcal site?</Title><Username>arrs20</Username><Timestamp>1343061667000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 12:41:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are correct, but I guess we are part of the site and prefer not to have spam.

I like the way the author puts it: "The company isn't in crisis yet." http://www.itproportal.com/2012/07/23/market-share-drop-from-93-to-4-is-real-story-behind-microsofts-fourth-quarter-results/ Market share drop from 93% to 4% is real story behind Microsoft's fourth-quarter results by Sascha Segan, 23 July, 2012 0 inShare Here's what you really need to know about Microsoft's fourth-quarter financial results: the company has 93 per cent market share of the past, but only 4 per cent of the future. Dealing with the post-PC era is Steve Ballmer's greatest challenge. Don't pay any attention to the headlines saying Microsoft scored its first overall loss since 1986; that's all because of a $6 billion (£3.86 billion) bad bet on a failed mobile advertising business, and it's over. Next quarter, Microsoft's numbers will return to normal. But that normal includes a declining Windows business for a declining PC world. Windows still has dominant, absolutely crushing market share in desktop PCs. According to Net Applications, Windows is still cruising along with about 93 per cent market share on desktops and laptops. Mac OS X has a lot of buzz, but it doesn't look like it's inspired a mass movement to switch. Microsoft's problem is that the entire PC category is in decline, and Microsoft has near-zero market share in the products replacing it. The Guardian ran a useful story analysing IDC sales estimates earlier this year, showing that as time goes on, forecasts for desktop and portable PC sales have tended to decline in favour of booming tablet and smartphone sales. Microsoft's smartphone market share has been moving in the wrong direction over the past few years. The company has had a shrinking segment of a growing pie. Windows Phone 7, while it won our Readers' Choice award this year, runs on generally uninspiring hardware and was poorly marketed as the "smartphone for people who hate smartphones." Thanks to AT&amp;T's heavy promotion of the Nokia Lumia 900, most recent smartphone market share results have Microsoft at 4 per cent in the US - and that's up from last year. Microsoft-powered tablets are hardly measurable, although the company has had a tablet PC business for a decade now. Microsoft's one bright spot is in home entertainment, where the XBox 360 is doing very well. That's another growing, post-PC category. Microsoft Isn't Going Out of Business Let's not be too hysterical. Microsoft is no RIM, which may run out of cash in a few quarters, and it's no Nokia, which has had to downsize its business dramatically as its fortunes have shrunk. Microsoft's business and server divisions keep on churning out cash. The company isn't in crisis yet. But Microsoft has to avoid being stuck on the wrong side of history....</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343074298000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 16:11:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343074416000-38</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Corpora MSFT Didn't Catch me with my Pants Down.</Title><Username>shortcash219</Username><Timestamp>1343047000000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 08:36:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you should be happy the markets going up...if the market just went down...you wouldnt be able to trade it anymore.</Msg><Username>catherinewiley652</Username><Timestamp>1343074416000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 16:13:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343075054000-39</Id><Topic><Title>Market share drop from 93% to 4% is real story behind Microsoft's fourth-quarter results</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343074298000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 16:11:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wotopimp we are about to clean your clock and you still whistle as you walk past the graveyard W-8 and Surface as well as HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer etc etc tablets equipped with W-8 will turn your Iturds and suxturds into door stops and boat anchors just like the old days when MSFT cleaned AAPL and IBM's clocks</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1343075054000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 16:24:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343075093000-40</Id><Title>Politics aside/came across my desk</Title><Msg>Recession Not Likely, But Uneven Business Growth, Potential Slower Global Recovery Predicted D&amp;B | July 23, 2012 In releasing its first mid-year global outlook, D+B suggests that the second half of the year will be challenging, but there will be an overall climate of improving U.S. and global business health. “As we look over the first half of the year, a double-dip recession remains concerning, but D&amp;B’s data indicates that we will not have a repeat of 2008,” said Paul Ballew, chief economist, D&amp;B. “That is not to say that there aren’t challenges and risks ahead, but the past five years have seen a period of restructuring for many sectors. In general, companies are leaner and more flexible, which will help to bolster the economic recovery we anticipate later in the decade.”</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1343075093000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 16:24:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343075201000-41</Id><Topic><Title>Market share drop from 93% to 4% is real story behind Microsoft's fourth-quarter results</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343074298000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 16:11:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;we are about to clean your clock&gt; You've been saying that for years.

Learn to spell it. F I R E F O X. Now, when did I ever say Firefox was going to overtake IE? I noted that a lot of people were downloading Firefox every day -- every second, in fact. I noted that its usage share was steadily rising, and that of IE was falling. That was true, but all you could do was lie about it. &lt;I am able to foretell the future and you are not&gt; LOL &lt;just as firefox is now tumbeling toward 10 again&gt; Chrome is now comfortably ahead of IE, so you can no longer claim that IE is the leader. Firefox is slipping slightly, but IE is sliding much faster. We can expect to see Firefox ahead of IE at some point. But that is old news and beside the point. As the article points out, Microsoft is still dominant in the PC market, but nowhere in the mobile market. Maybe Microsoft will be able to jump the chasm, but there are no signs of it yet.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343077172000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 16:59:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343077850000-46</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's vow to take on Apple: More bluster than truth</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343064428000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-23 13:27:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It's way past time for him to go - what's he trying to prove?
