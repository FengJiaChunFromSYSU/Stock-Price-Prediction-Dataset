IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Local Corporation (LOCM), a leading online local media company, today announced record mobile search traffic for the second quarter of 2013. The company achieved mobile search traffic of 34 million monthly unique visitors (MUVs) during the second quarter 2013, up 79 percent from 19 million MUVs during the year ago period and up 6 percent from 32 million MUVs during the first quarter 2013. “With 80 percent of local searches expected to be done via a mobile device by 20181, mobile continues to reshape the local search landscape. We believe our growth in mobile illustrates that we are well-equipped for this transformation,” said Heath Clarke, Local Corporation chairman and CEO. “We are uniquely positioned with five patents issued in the mobile advertising format known as pay-per-call/mobile lead generation. We expect these will become the leading ad products for monetizing local mobile searches. With advertisers committing increasing budgets to mobile, our record mobile traffic and intellectual property represent an opportunity to capitalize on this trend.” According to BIA/Kelsey, U.S. local ad spending on mobile is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 49.3 percent, from $1.2 billion in 2012, to $9.1 billion in 2017.</Msg><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1373711548299</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 06:32:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373711698808-6</Id><Topic><Title>Patents and Patent Applications of Local Corp</Title><Username>flankenking</Username><Timestamp>1371975812041</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-23 04:23:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A compare with Priceline and Tripadvisor (Source: Siteanalytics) .

Your logic fails. Like G, you are unable to answer questions, only spewing the same old rhetoric like the obvious fact "following isn't illegal." What about types of following like stalking and harassing? Try to do that to someone and see if they don't call the police on your sorry behind. They will call the police and see what you are up to. It's just ike your clipping words, you only want to find ways to support your illogical theories. In other words, you're a certified rwnj. It was unjust to allow G to go on his own words, especially since he was walking around like it was coffee break at the police station, right after. No, he was not justified, and is the reason nuts like you and him are emboldened to be brave, and cause trouble with your concealed weapons protecting your cowardice. Better be faster on the draw than the other guy with one, that's quite a society you have created down there in the swamps. The unarmed child, and under the law he was such, did not have to die, period. Concrete sidewalks are not arms, only an insane person could use that logic. In the re-enactment video you can see G is not that fat or unfit, his arms look pretty good and he was using a punching bag. No way it was self defense, no way , no how. The true story has been left untold because took the fifth. There were no bushes where the event took place, and the ones by the houses are like one foot high.

Cement bags that have bloody scars probably HAVE been pounded, regardless of lame attempts to suggest otherwise. Cement bags with broken noses may fear they are about to tear irreparably and defend themselves. It's too bad the young man over-estimated his abilities and too bad he mis judged his opponent. Youngsters dies every day making bad decisions to drive too fast or do some stupid stunt. It's too bad the lessons of life are so harsh for some of them. Since we are speculating, I speculate Trayvon was a wanna be tough racist punk. I doubt he would have jumped a black man. I speculate he thought he would kill a 'cracker" who dared to question his loitering in the rain and who over estimated his own badness as compared to the real world.

Well put, but to be fair to him, he doesn't believe anything he posts. He posts to rile people up and get a response. I answer him and ridicule him because it lets him think he has accomplished his mission. Meanwhile he serves the purpose as a typical clueless lefty foil.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373762538400</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 20:42:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373763634866-57</Id><Topic><Title>WP + Android dual boot will be a screaming success</Title><Username>pc_addicte</Username><Timestamp>1373739666366</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:21:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Who needs you wonton the SUX hate shill? go post on the right board IDIOT.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1373763634866</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 21:00:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373764650252-58</Id><Topic><Title>Go get 4, 50lb sacks of cement</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1373751518920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 17:38:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>well genius the sacks of concrete represent G, the 150 lbs T, because it's important to realize the child could not pick up the man like Omara was deceiving when he was flinging the 3 lb doll around. How you put 200 lbs of concrete on the ground, and then imagine you weigh 150, equates to 200=150 is typical of a right wing wacko.

There were certainly people stronger than I. You contrived a nonsense, non applicable situation that, in spite of your nonsensical manipulation of the facts, still doesn't work. Zimmerman's head was indeed bloodied, his nose was indeed broken. Despite the lies of the racists here, there were indeed bushes to hide in, the story was credible and consistent.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373765929514</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 21:38:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373766472504-62</Id><Topic><Title>Already a miscarriage of justice in Zimermen case because of political considerations</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373727222530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:53:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" One month before he died, he was a sixteen year old." One month before his first birthday he was zero then, right? He was a newborn at 11 months. Well sorry, in Florida 15 year olds are charged as adults every day.

Just the little ones by the houses. No one hid in those in the rain, too low. He made it up. He made most of the story up to save himself. Likely Trayvon was taking shelter from the rain, Z approached him and it all started. It's over for now, not guilty. Trayvon is dead regardless of verdict, George, I hope, will not hurt anyone else from what he has learned, and will have a good life. Six people in FL made the decisiin and that's how it works, case closed, as far as this part. The main thing is he was processed through the system and not let go on his word alone. I'm glad it's done.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1373770020157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 22:47:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373772819839-65</Id><Topic><Title>3 days till $50 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1373740294531</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 14:31:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In what currency????
