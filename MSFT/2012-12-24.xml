No lines for Win 8 Oh No ! So they buy Win 7 and they are buying the touch screen computers. Acer is ticked off because they are lacking touch screen computers, HP and DELL had no negative comments. And if they want lines there will be plenty when Xbox 720 comes. MSFT is a 3.4% savings account that has a real chance of significant principle growth, pension funds know it hedge funds know it and they want your

Raising marginal tax rate 4% isn't changing anything for a rich person. Your/my marginal tx rate will be protected under our President Obama. Romny paid less than 14%, Obama paid over 20%.

From the Economist "Republicans have locked themselves into an impossible position on budgeting by simultaneously vowing never to allow taxes hikes, and passing long-term budgets that create a fiscal cliff necessitating tax hikes. It's in Mr Obama's interests to gain Republican cooperation to work out the best possible deal, but if that's not forthcoming, it's also in his interests to use the impossibility of the Republicans' position to weaken them. Back before the elections, Mr Chait wrote a piece distilling the thinking he'd heard from Obama aides on the budget debates. "The term that keeps popping up among Obamans is break," Mr Chait wrote, "as in, 'we have to break the Republicans on taxes.'" That strategy seems to be working out. Either Mr Obama is going to break the Republicans on taxes, or he's going to try to break the Republicans. On taxes.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1356368572205</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 12:02:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356369174222-25</Id><Topic><Title>The Obama Mandate Is Strong!</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1356367643652</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:47:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama ran on raising taxes for incomes above $250K.

In a very short time a device called Surface Pro will be available. Microsoft has reinvented the tablet. The tablet is what everyone wants. Now there will be a tablet/Combo full PC that you can do all your work on. Releasing RT before Pro hindered RT's sale. Surface RT is actually ad deal. Free Office. Several hundred dollar program will not be on pro. So Ballmer should not go as they are about to change everything. Not only tablets. Win8 Phone has been strong enough in one month to scare apple shareholders into a massive sell off and become #3 phone. I personally own the New Noki lumia with WIN8 and it is a game changer. Fantastic experience that made me leave my Apple device home after 1 week. I love the turn by turn voice assisted navigation on the phone that locates my position instantly, tell me mph and how long to reach my destination. It works, it is not perfect but no Apple problems that sent Emergency workers in a forest, river etc. The camera is the best on any phone. It is selling out overseas and Nok has landed a contract with the largest phone carrier in China. Microsoft has invested billions into Nokia. Not only is Ballmer doing everything correct he is innovating. THERE IS NO OTHER MACHINE THAT IS A TABLET/FULL PC. Anyone that cannot see the future her should not be investing. It is easy. Ballmer is now on the level of Steve Jobs as the Surface Pro and the 100's of other W8 devices are about to change everything! I own qqq holds app, msft &amp; Nok.</Msg><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1356373777706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 13:29:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356374008389-32</Id><Topic><Title>Ballmer Should Not Go!</Title><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1356373777706</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 13:29:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thats what I'm waiting for,it should blow Itoy/goog out of the water.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1356374008389</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 13:33:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356374034279-33</Id><Topic><Title>An absolute, defined fundamental lie by Obama, dispute the facts if you can.</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1356358579002</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 09:16:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What did they serve you for lunch?

I know it's hard if you have little knowledge of what is even happening at MSFT and have no idea about investments in Nokia, when MSFT Pro is being release etc. It seems that people who bought 10 shares of apple at 700 or goog and are desperate to do anything possible to save their 10 shares. No not 1000 or 100 just 10. You sure seem disgruntled. Maybe don't listen to the bald celebrity who was recommending apple at 700. He was saying" All I know is the apple store is packed every time I go". It is packed with dimwits trying to find out how to get out of another freeze up on Safarai. To dumb to know the only solution is to turn it off and back on. That is the Genius bars answer by the way. Then you have the teenagers out in the mall playing on the machines. So if he was basing buying apple at 700 you guys should not have listened to him. MSFT is the reason the stock is going down. CNB... spent a week saying is this it is that it, asking every analyst alive why apple is dropping. Year end tax selling bla bla bla. How about a tablet is coming along that you can run any computer program that you have been using for 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. Let's see Microsoft's Billions of users will say well I can buy an Ipad and read the newspaper or I can buy a Win8 tablet and use all the programs I have been using all my life. Sell your 10 shares of aapl or goog and man up. It's over. Msft has innovated while aaple was creating a map program that sent police and fireman into a river while responding to a call. What where they doing all day at aapl. Then they give up and say we will use google maps. How can anyone trust a company that is supposed to have the greatest talent in the worls and they cannot fix map software and use a competitors program out of desperation. Nice. I hold qqq contains aapl, msft &amp; Nok.</Msg><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1356385862373</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 16:51:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356388492198-48</Id><Title>Microsoft's Craig Mundie will retire in 2014</Title><Msg>Yet another plausible Ballmer successor on his way out.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1356388492198</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 17:34:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356391611677-49</Id><Topic><Title>Obama cleverly splitting up the republican party.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1356368572205</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 12:02:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is setting himself up so he will not be reelected. Funny NO? He sent the special gathering of bi-part participants to develop a compromise on the revenue and spending. Their back drop was to implement the so called "fiscal cliff" if they failed to reach an agreement. Both parties working together developed this. It was not expected to actually be executed but it was the stimulus to get the job done and make a compromise. Each side sees a possible political gain and takes a blind eye to working for the betterment of the country. They should be reminded they are not running for reelection now at this late hour. The election is over. Now is time to do the job they have been elected to do. Balance the budget is not possible but reducing the growth of spending and increasing revenue (taxes) is. It seems to me that Obama is not encouraging the Senate to reconsider their spending but only working with the house to increase taxes. Obama should be encouraging both to compromise. Those responsible in the past for raising taxes have been stiff armed by not having spending controls implemented as has been promised. They do not want another stiff arm. They want to see the spending growth rates reduced first. Seems simple. Why does not the smartest mind in Washington see it too? He does not seek reelection. What is his problem with bartering a solution?</Msg><Username>oldexbanker</Username><Timestamp>1356391611677</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 18:26:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356391826915-50</Id><Title>I see we have a new board while I was away, but I also see other things never change</Title><Msg>The whiners are still trying to get their hands deeper into the pockets of the job providers.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1356391826915</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 18:30:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356392300443-51</Id><Topic><Title>The Obama Mandate Is Strong!</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1356367643652</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 11:47:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is a good campaigner and good speaker.

It is still a dominant force whenever I go. Not all version of other software is certified yet on Windows 8. I guess that there is a 1 month to 6 month time lag for organization to catch up. For individual like me, I had bad experience with Linux with multi-media on linux and scrambled for drivers. At another time, the document I sent out written using OpenOffice was shifted in format - that is for an important business document. All in all, I still have to contribute to Bill Gate's philanthropy indirectly and revert it to Windows and Office for the support. So, Windows 8 sales will be ramped up in soon.. Do not forget the biggest market will soon be the 1.3 billion people in China and another one quarter of world population in India. This is why Microsoft sales are increasing year after year. It's ROE is 24 - 48%, returning 3.5% as dividend, therefore, in theory, 21.05% left in the company to generate greater value. Sooner or later, another special dividend to unload some cash. I am targeting at least $40 in 2013 and collecting 3.5% while I wait..</Msg><Username>topinvestgun1</Username><Timestamp>1356401266721</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-24 21:07:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
