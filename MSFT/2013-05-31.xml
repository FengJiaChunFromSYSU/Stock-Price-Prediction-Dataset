AU Optronics (AUO) and Innolux both are panel suppliers for BlackBerry, but the two companies declined to comment on orders from individual clients. Initial sales of BlackBerry 10 smartphones, particularly the BlackBerry Q10 which comes with a QWERTY keyboard, in the US and Europe have been strong, lifting market sentiment for BlackBerry, said the sources. Component suppliers in Taiwan believe that BlackBerry is likely to further expand the BlackBerry family by releasing entry-level and mid-range BlackBerry 10 models for emerging markets in the second half of 2013. Sales of BlackBerry phones in Indonesia and the Middle East have been successful, and if the business model can be replicated in other emerging markets, the vendor is likely to ship 30-40 million smartphones in 2013, estimated the sources.

Indeed words have meanings, my point exactly. I think we can agree the President must be a citizen. Once you agree to that, what are the ways to be a citizen? One can become a citizen by "naturalization" or by birth. Since Obama was a citizen by birth, where he was born is not germane to the discussion. He is a citizen, he was not "naturalized" thus he is "natural born" citizen regardless of birth location.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1370005277168</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 09:01:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370005283336-15</Id><Topic><Title>There is no god.

With the new Obamacare you wait until the condition is discovered then *WE* pay more to cover *YOU*. In the interim, before *YOU* need the coverage *YOU* save on premiums that should be going into a treatment kitty, then *WE* have to make up for the money *YOU* kept in a saving account, just another way to redistribute money from the responsible to the less responsible, which I realize makes lazy deadbeats like you happy.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1370005683792</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 09:08:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370006225900-18</Id><Topic><Title>Sen.

She pleaded no contest to four of the eight counts in exchange for prosecutors dropping the four remaining charges. The judge immediately convicted Melowese Richardson, and she now faces up to six years in prison. She will be sentenced on July 9 (boy, July 4th would have been a perfect date to send her off to the hoosegow for her crimes against America). Richardson is the third person in the county to be convicted of illegal Obama voting this year, and three others have cases pending. Sure wish it was possible to investigate all areas of fraud in Democrat registration and voting. I'd even be open to a little tax increase in order to build enough federal prisons to house them all.</Msg><Username>plmartin_2012</Username><Timestamp>1370010142031</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 10:22:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1370010310767-41</Id><Title>Citizenship: Cruz vs Obama (NOW Look At The Hypocrisy From A 68 Year Old Farce)</Title><Msg>Regarding Cruz's citizenship, hawfarce said: I think his parents were married so only one needs to be citizen, which is not in dispute.

There is only one reason Obama is getting hammered like no other president in history, finally now by many in the kook media and on the left. He and his administration are waging a full scale assault on the Constitution and the limits it places on what the federal government can get involved in, which equally and directly subverts the very foundation of American freedom and liberty. It is becoming apparent to more and more people that he actually IS the radicalized, kook, Marxist, progressive leftist that some were warning about in 2008. He has greatly accelerated, in his five years in office, the socioeconomic decay that began in the late 60's. But hopefully the current exposure of the darkness and corruption that lies beneath will put an end to his ability to press his destructive policies, and force those that want that kind of government to move to Europe where they can enjoy the social justice of equality of mediocrity. Race? I would vote any day of the week for Clarence Thomas, Condi Rice, Marco Rubio, Thomas Sowell, J.C. Watts, Ben Carson, Herman Cain, Allen West, Ted Cruz, Michael Steele, Mia Love, Artur Davis, Alan Keyes, Lynn Swan, Bobby Jindal, Tim Scott, etc. I wouldn't vote for my mother if for some sick reason she ran for office as a Democrat.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1370019648973</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-31 13:00:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1370019692251-91</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi is going to reveal how corrupt and dishonest this regime is at some point</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367455900319</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 20:51:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean the one lady who was accused of voting for her daughter, not founf guilty?
