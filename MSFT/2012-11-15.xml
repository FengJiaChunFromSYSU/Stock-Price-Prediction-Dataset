Ouch! One problem with the Surface Tablet is the Bloatware. Windows 8 RT takes 16gb of flash memory just to install it. You need at least 32gb of flash memory for a usable system. iOS can install on 16gb of flash memory with plenty of room to spare. This doubles the cost of the flash memory components of Surface Tablets. To make things even worse, many desktop users don't like Windows 8 and Metro. Why spend $500-600 for a device with a questionalble graphical interface? What about Apps? Existing Windows 7 and XP programs won't run on Windows 8 RT.

Look at the people examining new laptops and you'll see confusion. They look like a deer staring into headlights because hardware instead of a familiar desk they see the display filled with tiles and they have no idea what to do. Instead of selling the laptop the salesperson tries to explain to the customer what has to be done to make Windows 8 tiles look and behave like the Windows 7 the customer understands, and even then its a futile effort. A principle of sales psychology holds that a confused mind says "No" and consumers are overwhelmingly confused and frustrated by what they see when shopping for a new laptop equipped with Windows 8, especially if the laptop doesn't have touch. However, the few laptops with touch on the store shelves start at a much higher price than the most customers want to buy. Laptops today can be purchased as a low as $399 but touch models start at about $800 but most start around $1100 or more. and these higher priced units are way beyond what most consumers want to spend in this economy. By the time the salesperson explains what has to be done to Windows 8 to make it even recognizable, plus the hours, days or even weeks spent configuring and having to relearn what they already knew how to do plus the possibility of having to install third party software to get a Start Menu that works, the customer says' "forget it" and walks away. Store salespeople have seen this scenario play out so many times they're reconfiguring the W8 PC's to look as much like W7 as possible, but it still isn't working. W8 is a disaster.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1352974966198</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 05:22:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352976392144-16</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 Seen Slowing Laptop Sales</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1352974966198</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 05:22:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're obviously much too STUPID to run w8.

Obama is too advanced in the use of english for you. Talking about something isn't always having been involved with it. A ten year old understands this. Parsing what words were used and when on the attack is ridiculous. It serves no purpose except putting up false political clouds so the base can get angry about something.

Mini is out to compete with smaller tablets, what's so hard to understand about that? Then you said: "The corporation gives nothing away to help Sandy Victims. I am talking about the company and not its employees." Wrong! ====== "Apple Donates $2.5 Million To Red Cross Sandy Relief Posted: 11/09/2012 1:58 pm EST Updated: 11/09/2012 4:12 pm EST It’s perhaps one of the most striking signs that Apple is running under new leadership. The company announced on Thursday that it’s donating $2.5 million to the American Red Cross’ Sandy relief efforts, VentureBeat reports. While it’s always been heralded for its innovation, Apple wasn’t considered the most generous company when the late Steve Jobs maintained control of the company." ===== "Cook needs to be burned over an open grill. I hope he does. If I worked for Apple - I'd be long gone by now." Sounds like your wounds run a lot deeper. And you know what, you ONLY wished they give you a job at Apple. So... Sure, I'll go back to sleep, but that's when you start making some sense and after taking your meds, till then why don't you shut the hell up.

We created this false economy with free trade and worldwide invitation to citizenship for anyone with lots of money. Free trade is kind of like the Terminator movie. Once it's out of the bag - there is no turning back - no government or army or group can stop it. We are on a world stage with corporate profits and the most economical way to place the manufactures or workers makes the most business sense. China has lax labor laws, lax environmental laws, federal sponsorship, fed can make a decision a dime versus committee or democracy. China is run by a few oligarchs.

But why ? Windows 8 Phone on ARM phones ? Windows RT on ARM tablets ? Full Windows 8 on dual-core Intel Atom tablets ? Android on dual-core Intel Atom tablets ? Android on single-core Intel Atom phones ? Android on ARM tablets and phones ? That's three possibilities for each of Windows, Intel, and Android. And one possibility for Wintel. Or is it simply competition from all the computer makers and the killer app is not yet known ?</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1353009992292</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:06:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353010487875-103</Id><Title>With apple going down with Fire from China MS safe bet for stability</Title><Msg>With apple going down with Fire from China MS safe bet for stability-buy some silver along with it and your portfolio will have a good base.</Msg><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1353010487875</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 15:14:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353010521882-104</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi Is An Attempted Republican Distraction From Fiscal Cliff.</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1353008290928</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 14:38:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Moral conservatives don't use the death of 4 patriots as a distraction.

This is what is known in some quarters as an argument from intimidation. The clear intention is to intimidate anyone who might make so bold as to point out that you're making a completely unsupported assertion devoid of any content, and therefore you are full of it.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1353015474112</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 16:37:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353018083686-113</Id><Topic><Title>Love the Win 8 -- this is revolution guys.</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1353001453423</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:44:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft made the same criticism of those that complained about Vista and were those PC users wrong? Absolutely not. They tested it and they understand it's a waste of time. Just look at the number of articles and posts of people that say it's awful on anything without touch, and even awkward with large 24" and 27" touch monitors. One reporter said Microsoft "threw desktop users under the bus". PC customers will ultimately render a verdict and so far it's not good.</Msg><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1353018083686</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 17:21:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353019249343-114</Id><Topic><Title>Love the Win 8 -- this is revolution guys.</Title><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1353001453423</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-15 12:44:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We use Win7 pro now. what version of Win 8 would we use, with a mouse, no touchy - feally.
