I would be okay with a version of the Series 9 that rotates the screen and then snaps it into place over the keyboard with the screen facing up for tablet use. That could have Win 8 but it must not weigh more than 2.6 pounds weight with a 13.3" screen. These convertible laptops that weigh 3.5 pounds are funny. The other form factor is the Samsung ATIV 500T and 700T. They simply detach from the keyboard for use as a tablet. The weight is 1.6 pounds and the screen size is 11.6".</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1354893706743</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:21:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354893739021-36</Id><Topic><Title>WHO IS OBAMA?</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1354865254213</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 02:27:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep talking that way, keep losing.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1354893739021</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 10:22:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354894142484-37</Id><Topic><Title>Obama to spend $4 million to go to Hawaii for Christmas, we need to raise taxes</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1354756362472</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 20:12:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"What's on the docket for tomorrow's yapping?' employment numbers, and what Obama has done wrong wth them.

Our organization deploys Microsoft products and uses them almost exclusively save for a few Linux systems. I have extensive experience using and supporting Microsoft server applications and Microsoft desktop products. I will give you a quick rundown on what I see emerging from an IT perspective. This might get you long. Currently, all IT organizations are being driven to cut costs like any other part of the organization. Spending is tight. We are doing this by maximizing hardware utilization. We have found that by virtualization of our network we can save lots of money. Most networks use only 10-20 percent of their capacity but with virtualization we can push it up to 80 or even 90 percent. This saves a lot of money. Before only way to virtualization was to buy virt software from VMware or Citrix. Now Microsoft started to include this in Windows server 2008 and now with Windows server 2012 it is a very good product. This will benefit Microsoft because no longer do I have to pay for VMware on top of Microsoft I can skip buying the VMware product and just buy Windows server 2012. I might buy more Server 2012 licenses so that I can leverage the Virtualization capabilities in their product. So from an investment perspective, this will be good for Microsoft but bad for VMware and to a lesser degree Citrix. It will be also bad for the hardware vendors because us IT folks aren't buying as much hardware as before. I have been testing Windows 8 in beta form for months. I have not found any real issues with it. It is very different than 7 but the software is solid. In fact, it was one of the best beta desktop OS's that I have ever tested out of Microsoft. People miss the start button but wow you can get it third party. My sources tell me that it is coming back in the next service pack. You will always have those type of complaints when you do something as radical as Microsoft has done here. Honestly, I was surprised by the changes but when I figured out that they designed it with touch screen in mind then it made perfect sense. Touchscreen will get very important in the next 5 years. I believe that Apple and Google recognized it early and profited from it. Now Microsoft is ready upset the Apple cart. Most folks use Microsoft OS at home so they are more prone to buy a Microsoft PC device then not. Cloud is getting very big in the IT field. Particularly in the area of SAS. Microsoft has launched initiatives such as Skydrive and Microsoft 365 are getting very important too them. They also have Azure. These things are starting to get traction in the market place. Microsoft is set to capture a significant portion of the cell phone market. The Win8 phones are amazing and the new ones from Nokia, the Lumia are outstanding and selling out. MSFT is a terrific buy for long term investors at this price. Disclosure: Long MSFT and NOK no position in VMW CTSX GOOG, or AAPL short or long.</Msg><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1354921091703</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 17:58:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354921210458-123</Id><Topic><Title>The case for investing in MSFT</Title><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1354921091703</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 17:58:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, MS employees sure write long posts to pump their stock grants.

Since you did not learn the basics I will try and point them out to you. There are four corners on a touch screen left, right, top &amp; bottom. You simply swipe your finger from the outside edge of the screen inward. From the right side of the screen swipe in and click start. One swipe and 1 tap and you are back at the main start screen. Your other complaint the back button. All programs are not identical and programmers have two options. From the bottom of the screen swipe up with your finger and press the back arrow in the lower left corner. Otherwise, the back arrow is in the middle left of the screen border and maybe also lower left. You may see both of these. Not so complicated, ugly arrows are hidden and revealed by a simple swipe from the bottom of the screen up. 1.) Start Screen Using Touch Only. Swipe the screen form the right border of the screen in the middle and tap the start tile. DONE!!! 2.) Back Button- Swipe up with your finger from the bottom of the screen. An arrow will appear in the lower left or middle left of the screen. Tap the arrow. DONE!!! Any of other problems or concerns.

The difference is you get a free version of Microsoft Office. That means if you need or use office you save several hundred dollars and are only paying a few hundred for a state of the art tablet that has a magnetic keyboard that attaches fast &amp; nice. One of the biggest complaints of IPAD users was they could not use office and apples email is a pain. You cannot delete all messages in a batch. What is up with that. Apple IPad sales and droid tablets are also slower than expected currently. There is now market saturation of tablets. There is no more waiting in lines for days. That was a once in a life time thing. The surface RT is what is it is. You won't get a free version of Microsoft office with Surface Pro. Some may want to think that over and not pass the opportunity of getting the free Microsoft Office and a tablet for basically a few hundred if you deduct the value of Office. It is actually a steal. Sometimes people do not realize what they have until it is gone. If you need office and a tablet, the deal is now. It does what it is supposed to be a tablet. For $499.00 and a free very polular software package what do you expect to pay $199.00. It is not a droid it cannot sell for $199.00. The droid is so complicated you have to be a genius to figure out how to do anything thus the $199.00 price just to move it out the door and hope someone accidentally clicks on ad words ads trying to find hidden or confusing controls. The Surface RT is a bargain, you just do not know it. It is for on the go use, not sitting on your desk!!!
