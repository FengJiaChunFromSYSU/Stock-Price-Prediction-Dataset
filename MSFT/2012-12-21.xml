This resolution sets the aggregate levels of spending and revenue that is expected to occur in a given fiscal year. Hence each session of Congress, a budget resolution by law must be enacted by April 15. This target date is rarely met, and in at least four years (FY1999, FY2003, FY2005, and FY2007) no budget resolution was ultimately adopted." Note that Bush the lesser was unable to make recommendations or provide guidelines that were capable of forming the basis for a concurrent budget resolution, and the "leadership" of fatso Hastert "the Turk" and "Doctor" Frist (the for-profit medical insurance scammer) was unable to provide any way to fill that gap in leadership on the part of the Wumpus-hunter-in-Chief. So when Hawfreak's many aliases ramble off on some inane and nonsensical tangent fed by talking points ginned up by the most mentally challenged of the right-wingnut "intelegensia" it's simply an indication of his discomfort with the condition of his adult diaper in its third day of use.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1356090720965</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 06:52:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356093992459-3</Id><Topic><Title>Boehner gave up too much, he needs to get tough and tell Nobama where to stick</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1356057993473</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-20 21:46:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama is the worst president in American History...

After all, what’s up one day can go down the next. But it’s difficult to see what took place in Congress last night as anything other than an unmitigated disaster and embarrassing blunder for House Republicans -- all over something that was viewed as a negotiating tactic or PR move. After being closer than ever before in striking a deal with President Obama to resolve the looming tax increases and spending cuts set to take place after Dec. 31, Speaker John Boehner and the House GOP leadership turned their attention to passing “Plan B,” a one-sided plan to raise tax rates on income above $1 million as a way apparently to gain more leverage over the Obama White House. The result: Unable to get enough GOP support, House Republicans pulled the vote and announced they were going home for the Christmas holiday. And now? By demonstrating that they’re unable to corral sufficient votes, they’ve lost any leverage they held in the debate. The biggest thing we’ve learned after last night: No one right now is capable of leading the House Republicans. Outgoing GOP Rep. Steve LaTourette might have put it best. "It's unbelievable, this is horrible," he said, per NBC’s Frank Thorp. "I'm angry, I'm sad for my friend the speaker, and I'm sorry for the country. We deserve better."</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1356114224060</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 13:23:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356115560742-36</Id><Title>Tyranny from within ironically</Title><Msg>may be the NRA.

(Presumably there would also have been training for one or more school officials, in safe use of firearms.) But that idea was voted down, the attitude being that the school ought to be a sort of Camelot, somehow magically safe and serene, with nothing done to make it so. I'm guessing whoever voted that way is being very quiet about it now.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1356127484744</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 17:04:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356129071655-44</Id><Topic><Title>Tyranny from within ironically</Title><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1356115560742</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 13:46:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's right jerk put a guard in every school.... wait there are at least 10 enterences to each school .... so put 10 guards at every school with guns.... wait ... they need more than that ... give each guard a automatic wepon and gernads .... that will stop the problem.... wait .... they might need rocket launchers too..... can we get real!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>moldinc</Username><Timestamp>1356129071655</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 17:31:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356135277177-45</Id><Title>No One Could Cut A Deal With The Tea Party House.

If he did, he'd be saying to congress. Get the revenue anyway possible, and we will make major cuts to spending which is the big problem. Obama just wants to make the GOP look bad, and blame them for not cooperating.. In the end Obama will be credited with not wanting to cut spending, and the reason we went over the cliff. But it should be no concern to the poor, and the Middle Class. They were going to get hosed by Obama's policy support anyway.</Msg><Username>smalltowndude01</Username><Timestamp>1356146719549</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-21 22:25:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
