Windows 8 is the best electronics experience of my life. It is equal to the thrill of the internet starting over again or Windows 95. I love it and now have multiple machines. I run several businesses and have a circle of laptops surrounding me so I can trade stocks, run my businesses, write code that may be a new business idea. Once you learn how to use it, the experience blows everything away and you will never want to go back to a non touch screen win 7 again. Even when I have to pick up an old win 7 notebook to get something I cannot wait to pick up a laptop with win 8. Anyone that says a touch screen would not help is out of it. The people that have them are breezing by you. The free apps are amazing. The live updates are cool and amazing. The modern look of the interfaces and apps is refreshing. I also bought the Nokia lumia 822 phone with W8. If you do not like that something is wring with you. Stop writing messages and get some anti depressants or something. I can run multiple businesses on the go from a Win 8 phone. I have 8 pop 3 email accounts configured it tells me on the main screen when a new message comes in. I can place orders from my suppliers in the full browser mode, access any website and do anything I could from a full pc. The voice assisted turn by turn gps map programs is a life saver. It locates my exact position on a map and gives me the option of directions via public transportation, walking or driving. Lists my speed in mph on the screen and does everything a gps does right from my win8 phone. You guys are sounding really really old and dated. These new devices are such a great experience (the free apps alone) that you sound ridiculous and embarrassing to yourselves. Anyone with the new devices will be able to pass you up in business, life and on the fun meter. You guys are so 1980's.</Msg><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1357388799697</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 07:26:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357390791820-10</Id><Title>Lovin W8 &amp; Nokia WinPhone 8</Title><Msg>Love Win 8 experience.</Msg><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1357390791820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 07:59:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357391975540-11</Id><Title>Win 8 users will pass you up if you are not using it.</Title><Msg>I can program, draw, order, read email, research faster on win 8 with a touch screen. I also have a laptop without a touch screen and it is not bad. Certainly not the way the bashers say it is. There are only several small things to learn that makes everything they are saying about the start button ridiculous. 1.) The Windows button takes you back to the main start screen from anything. 2.) You can search for anything: Control Panel, Run, Calculator, Program Name. 3.) It shows up instantly. 4.) Right click on it. Choose pin to start at the bottom of the screen and now it is on the main screen with all your world on 1 screen. No need to hit the start button because you can put everything in the start button on the main screen if you choose. Done! The free apps are amazing. If you do not like them or the experience get on anti depressants. Win8 is on the level of the thrill you will get the first time you used Win 95 or first connection to the internet. It is an experience not another boring computer. You will not want to use an old machine once you start using Win8. Win phone 8 is even more of an experience. I can run multiple businesses on the road. I cannot write code but I can have 8 pop 3 email accounts and it updates live on the main screen when an order comes in. I can place orders from my suppliers as I can use a full function web browser that is actually useable. The alarm and calendar are dependable. The maps really shine. On my Nokia Lumia 822 w8 I get voice assisted turn by turn gps directions. It pinpoints my position on the map automatically and all I have to do is enter the destination and it starts telling me where to turn with the voice assistant. Tell my speed, destination arrival time and give the option of travelling by public trans, walking or driving. This feature is worth the price of the phone alone. I have a 8mp Carl Zeiss camera that is better than my separate camera. No need to carry a camera anymore. It shows me where all the food places and hot spots are wherever I am. Too here someone bash an experience this good makes you guys look bad really bad. It give me an my businesses a big advantage. I can run circles around anyone that does not have w8 computers or phone. Argue all you want. I am laughing all the way to the bank why you guys reminisce over old tv shows from the 1980's. Why don't all the w8 bashers get together on the weekend and watch 80's tv shows. Maybe someone with an old Ford Bronco can start a car pool and pick up some of the other guys and you can watch reruns from the oldies channels. I cannot make it as I am busy changing the world, enjoying the w8 ride and making money! Have fun boys! You guys are so 1980.</Msg><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1357391975540</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 08:19:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357392245790-12</Id><Topic><Title>Win 8 users will pass you up if you are not using it.</Title><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1357391975540</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 08:19:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I set w8 up like I had w7, go to windows/system32 folder, and create a shortcut on the desktop for every MS program you find, that way there is no typing and searching, one click!</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1357392245790</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 08:24:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357392786599-13</Id><Topic><Title>Win 8 users will pass you up if you are not using it.</Title><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1357391975540</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 08:19:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree your way is good for an advanced user. If you go and do the same thing in some other folders. However, these guys that cannot even find the Windows key are not going to be able to do it that way. The people that cannot find the control panel can swipe in from left of screen type control panel in the search field and boom it is there. They can open it or pin it to the start screen. Your method is very good for people who know what they are doing though. Read some of these posts and think about if someone could actually find the system32 folder.

According to their sources sales of the HTC 8X has been “extremely strong in the US”. The HTC 8X has not been topping charts as far as we know on carriers in the US, but it is the only Windows Phone which is on sale on 3 of the 4 big carriers, meaning it can address a much larger market than the Nokia Lumia 920 for example. The handset’s main differentiating feature is its slim-line design and very high DPI and excellent Super-LCD 2 screen. HTC may reveal a bit more about the performance of the handset and their business when they report Q4 financials on the 7th January, which is of course in only 2 days.</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1357418430541</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 15:40:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357418747803-51</Id><Title>I don't see MSFT hitting 30 in two weeks.

Basically, the company was too successful for too long that a huge beauracracy is built and they can no longer adapt to changes quickly. For example, suppose MSFT's usability group that made Win95 successful did an analysis and pointed out an important feature runs better on the Mac than Win8. A recommendation on how to fix Win8 was given, but the engineering team decided the change is too troublesome and then make excuses like project delay or cost overrun to avoid the work. Balmer knows these people for too long and thus have to take their word and ship a product knowing it is weaker than the Mac and risk losing more users to the Mac ecosystem. A new CEO does not have the old relationships and will ask engineers for justification. The old excuses won't fly and the recommendation would be implemented. Management would be replaced by a leaner and meaner engineering team that can compete with GOOG and AAPL. In theory, anyone with some industry experience can do the job, but in practice, you need someone who have a good track record to stand up to the old management. Marisa Mayer is someone who has the track record. She was credited for making GOOG so successful by making GOOG interface simple.</Msg><Username>koala_castle</Username><Timestamp>1357437114956</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 20:51:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357438596960-68</Id><Topic><Title>Win 8 users will pass you up if you are not using it.</Title><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1357391975540</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-05 08:19:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Windows XP users will skip past Windows 8, just like they skipped past Vista.
