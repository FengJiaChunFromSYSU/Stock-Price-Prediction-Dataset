Given the dire state of the PC industry, patient investors were (understandably) jumping for joy. Any progress this company makes is always followed by a step or two backwards. On Tuesday, Microsoft announced that it sold 100 million copies of its flagship Windows 8 operating system, while also describing sales as having occurred in the "first six months of life." "Microsoft released Windows 8 in October, 2012. In its first three months of life (November through January) they say they moved 60 million copies of their new OS. But, that also means that after the initial release euphoria -- and the holiday shopping season boost -- they sold only another 40 million copies of Windows 8 in its second three months (February-April) of life. Any way you look at it those numbers mean sales are slowing down."

(NYSE:GS) said they downgraded Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Sell from Neutral. The firm’s hardware team predicts that the company’s PC market share will decelerate and fall from 73 percent in 2012 to 65 percent this year and then 59 percent next year. As a result, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) has lowered its estimates and price target for shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) to $27 per share from $30 per share. The biggest problem they see for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is its “poor consumer positioning,” which they believe diminishes opportunities for growth. In their view, the company’s total compute market share will continue eroding over the next two years while its financial results also deteriorate gradually.

EDT THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Every day, all across the world, American diplomats and civilians work tirelessly to advance the interests and values of our nation. Often, they are away from their families. Sometimes, they brave great danger. Yesterday, four of these extraordinary Americans were killed in an attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi. Among those killed was our Ambassador, Chris Stevens, as well as Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith. We are still notifying the families of the others who were killed. And today, the American people stand united in holding the families of the four Americans in our thoughts and in our prayers. The United States condemns in the strongest terms this outrageous and shocking attack. We're working with the government of Libya to secure our diplomats. I've also directed my administration to increase our security at diplomatic posts around the world. And make no mistake, we will work with the Libyan government to bring to justice the killers who attacked our people. Since our founding, the United States has been a nation that respects all faiths. We reject all efforts to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no justification to this type of senseless violence. None. The world must stand together to unequivocally reject these brutal acts. Already, many Libyans have joined us in doing so, and this attack will not break the bonds between the United States and Libya. Libyan security personnel fought back against the attackers alongside Americans. Libyans helped some of our diplomats find safety, and they carried Ambassador Stevens’s body to the hospital, where we tragically learned that he had died. It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi because it is a city that he helped to save. At the height of the Libyan revolution, Chris led our diplomatic post in Benghazi. With characteristic skill, courage, and resolve, he built partnerships</Msg><Username>ghosanonon</Username><Timestamp>1368020458970</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 09:40:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368020518682-44</Id><Topic><Title>GS Downgrade Right on Target....</Title><Username>jbspectrum</Username><Timestamp>1368017812558</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 08:56:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This is an expected pullback.

And make no mistake, justice will be done. But we also know that the lives these Americans led stand in stark contrast to those of their attackers. These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity. They should give every American great pride in the country that they served, and the hope that our flag represents to people around the globe who also yearn to live in freedom and with dignity.

You have no idea of the history of strength, character and purpose in American government and defense. Was a crime committed with regard to Benghazi? No, not until the administration starts lying about it under oath. The point is that no previous president in American history would have remained in office after presiding over such cowardice and incompetence in the face of a needless slaughter of our boys (two heroes of which were killed while taking action to defend remaining American lives, in direct defiance of administration orders to stand down). There is nothing suspected here - it is fact. The administration watched the 9-hour attack real time and had all support outside of the hot zone stand down, "HOPE-ing", just like with all issues, that unicorns and leprechauns would magically appear to "CHANGE" the situation and just make it all better. In the real grown up world, these situations often don't get better and evil prevails in the absence of righteous strength, resistance, and reinforcement. So the administration ganged up with America's kook liberal media parrots to conjure up and disseminate a story that the attackers (al Qaeda terrorists) were just some local rock throwers mad about an obscure online video, for which the fall guy creator of the video is still in jail.

No, absolutely not. We all know that liberals are the ones that really care about people. Especially.......the children. They do everything for the children, don't you know. Liberals are unequipped mentally and physically to quickly identify and then crush evil when it raises its head. They must try to talk to it, with an open mind - try to understand it and determine the roots, reasons and logic for it's darkness. They are pseudo-intellectually far more advanced than sheer hand-to-hand barbarism, even if it was required to protect their own. They stand in open-mouthed shock in the face of an outrageous evil offensive. That is why liberals should not even be given a seat at the discussion table of national defense or firearms. They should just continue to group huddle in one the corners of their gun-free facility as a criminal unloads his weapons into them, or just hope those horrible bad brutes will just shoo away in military situations or terrorist acts. Let men of the conservative breed handle defense, changing tires, and bringing food to America's tables for you liberals.</Msg><Username>plmartin_2012</Username><Timestamp>1368031277487</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 12:41:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368032013852-115</Id><Topic><Title>If MSFT does not take off I am going to jump</Title><Username>abonner656</Username><Timestamp>1368024567542</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 10:49:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thnx for the tip</Msg><Username>oxavier179</Username><Timestamp>1368032013852</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 12:53:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368032022106-116</Id><Topic><Title>If MSFT does not take off I am going to jump</Title><Username>abonner656</Username><Timestamp>1368024567542</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 10:49:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thnx for the tip</Msg><Username>oxavier179</Username><Timestamp>1368032022106</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 12:53:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368032189399-117</Id><Topic><Title>Insiders Selling</Title><Username>michelle.martell13</Username><Timestamp>1368022571525</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 10:16:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ok cool.

Ambassador John R. Bolton said. “This could be the hinge point,” he said to Newsmax. “It’s that serious for them.” -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- SEE RELATED: Benghazi ‘talking points’ altered, White House and State Dept. officials say -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mr. Bolton is now a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. His comments came as Congress is readying to hear testimony from several witnesses about the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. Witness Greg Hicks already has stated publicly that the administration was aware that the attack was terrorist in nature, and not related to protests of a YouTube film about Muslims, as originally stated. Mr. Bolton said these witnesses’ testimonies could prove explosive. “The three witnesses who have been identified are not bystanders,” he said in the Newsmax report. “These are not people who are going to report on hearsay of what somebody in Tripoli told somebody that they heard from. These are people who are directly involved in different capacities before, during and after the attack.” Committee staffers have hinted that the witnesses’ statements are going to prove “devastating,” especially for then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. And “you’ve already seen some Democratic members of Congress … beginning to run from this,” Mr. Bolton said in the Newsmax report.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1368040332364</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:12:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368040752797-158</Id><Topic><Title>Ballmer's a freaking IDIOT...</Title><Username>gollywogazoo</Username><Timestamp>1368010452024</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 06:54:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well no matter what people say when they leave a high level corporate position, there are usually two stories. The real truth and what they announce they are leaving for. She may have been passed up for a promotion she wanted and may have had her products after that sort of dissed. She claims to have been the original brain trust behind the simple non cluttered google search page. If so, that is a pretty big victory as Yahoo back in the day made your eyes hurt with 20 million links on one page. If she decided a single search field alone on the page was the way to go back in that cluttered era than she is a true revolutionary genius. So, don't assume that she will be willing to do anything with google. Women hold grudges much more than men and it get's personal. Her emotions that made her leave are an example. The real truth is when you share revenue of Search profits, you will make less than you did on your own if you have any relevance at all. She compared the revenue when Yahoo was independent to the revenue when they shared. It was higher when they were independent. She has a rough job ahead of her, but she can also bring many workers in to replace the ones that were so depressed of Yahoo's demise they can no longer innovate. She also know all the secrets of google and who to make more people click accidentally and what makes customers do this that and the other thing. She will go at it alone and try to get even with Google. Most businesses advertise with all search engines now not just google. I know I do. There are millions of me's. She will succeed in turning it around I believe. That has not been a big earner for Microsoft. When you have 78 billion a qtr coming in, you have a lot . of thing you are doing right. I do not think Ballmer's a freaking idiot. The revenue speaks for itself. The stock has been lacking street momentum until recently &amp; the apple &amp; google effect held it down.

Skullcandy has a market cap of $143 million with a net cash position of $34 million, which is almost 24% of Skullcandy's market capitalization. With a TTM PE ratio of 8.15 and a forward (2014) PE ratio of 12.9, we see Skullcandy shares as being undervalued. Skullcandy is selling for book value and has an Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio of just 2.84. Our interest in Skullcandy is primarily focused on Skullcandy's apparent plan to buy back up to $28 million in shares. With a fairly high short interest (22% of float), we believe that if Skullcandy is aggressive with its share buy back program it may cause a short squeeze. A short squeeze would be great for Skullcandy shares, in the short term, making the shares a nice short-term trade candidate. Also, we like that Skullcandy is a small company with attractive assets selling at a compelling valuation. These situations sometimes lead to a company being acquired by a larger competitor or by a private equity firm. With the catalysts of a possible short squeeze or a possible buy out, we believe that the market has overlooked Skullcandy and has not priced in these possibilities into the stock price. In our best-case scenario, we forecast that Skullcandy shares will rise 50% or more if there is a short squeeze or buy out. In our worst-case scenario, we forecast that Skullcandy will have a stable business that will maintain a relatively stable share price. We see this as a heads we win, tails we do not lose much type of investment.</Msg><Username>dariodbest</Username><Timestamp>1368040836912</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:20:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368040882592-160</Id><Topic><Title>phands the heretic is a joke</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368038138895</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 14:35:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Phands is rated "Imbecile", slightly above the level of idiocy, having a mental age of seven or eight years and an intelligence quotient of 25 to 50.</Msg><Username>aka_stockrackar</Username><Timestamp>1368040882592</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:21:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368042008857-161</Id><Topic><Title>Since Bolton now is the expert on Benghazi, according to cyper critquer, here is what he said yesterday</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1368040332364</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:12:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your inability to read with any reasonable adult level of comprehension and subsequent assignment of left wing OPINION (i.e 'this should put an end to') as if the OPINION were fact is astounding when juxtiposed against the idea that you are apparently breathing without a ventilator.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368042008857</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:40:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368042107251-162</Id><Title>Ben isn't giving up the manipulation pump without a fight, same thing daily</Title><Msg>sells in the morning, pump, build "con" fidence to stop selling, then pump the Maistro (the DOW) higher to drag other indices.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368042107251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:41:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368042269114-163</Id><Topic><Title>Insiders Selling</Title><Username>michelle.martell13</Username><Timestamp>1368022571525</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 10:16:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An article that's worth a read.</Msg><Username>gotbauma47</Username><Timestamp>1368042269114</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:44:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368042374296-164</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi is proving to be a source of much fukery for RWNJ</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1368025434531</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 11:03:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>doely you are even more stoooopid than dopeyjoe who is so dum b he cant wipe his own sas your evil gross exaggeration of Obamas behavior constitutes criminal libel and like the plmowrawn you need to be prosecuted and deported for cowardice ignorance sedition and your libelous drivel</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1368042374296</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:46:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368042766424-165</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi is proving to be a source of much fukery for RWNJ</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1368025434531</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 11:03:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Im already and engunear, sanitation engunear that is.

Both the R7 and R12 will run Windows Blue, Microsoft's recently-confirmed next-generation operating system. According to an anonymous source speaking with PhoneArena, HTC is planning to target the upper end of the tablet market with a pair of high-specification devices based on the upcoming Windows Blue RT release - also known as Windows 8.1. According to the site's source, the company is planning to launch a 7in and a 12in tablet, both with impressive specifications. The internal processor on both is claimed to be a 2.3GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core, the company's latest and fastest design, combined with 2GB of memory. Both tablets are claimed to include 16GB of internal storage, relatively low for a Windows-based tablet, but expandable with a micro-SD card slot included on both as standard. The rear of both devices are claimed to include a high-resolution 13 megapixel camera capable of recording Full HD video as well as capturing still images, which can be shared through in-built Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi connectivity.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368055695041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 19:28:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368055760768-193</Id><Topic><Title>ALL the fuss about Windows 8 problems for Desktop....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367983914000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-07 23:31:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is not completely true. If you have a laptop that has a touch pad that allows the same experience. Modern day touch pads allow scrolling with two fingers, zoom/pinch, tapping &amp; clicking. You can set it up so that your hand is moving on a touch pad like a screen. Developers wrote a large amount of the apps on machines that did not have touch screens. I had the developers version on a laptop that did not have touch for 6 months or so before Windows 8 was released to the public. I am currently using a notebook and use the touch pad for almost everything and the touch screen hardly at all. I have to switch between 3-6 open programming apps, switch between the RT UI on arm chips and older programs that use the x86 chips. I am doing as much at one time as you can possibly do on a machine and I am barely using the touch screen. Have not touched it at all in 5-6 hours. The note book is a high end laptop that has a touch pad that is enhanced with a lot of options. The touch pad drove me nuts for a few months until I tweaked the settings and turned 40% of the options of the touch pad off. I think they have beefed up the touch pads on the new Windows 8 laptops. Touch is definitely not necessary at all if you have a good touch pad. I would not lie, and I use a PC to multitask in a manner that I have to use 3,4,5,6 programs at the same time.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368055760768</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 19:29:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368056186784-194</Id><Topic><Title>Since Bolton now is the expert on Benghazi, according to cyper critquer, here is what he said yesterday</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1368040332364</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:12:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It is true that Obama, Billary and Co. lied about Benghazi, as they do just about everything, but I doubt it will bring them down by itself.

A leaked email is making the rounds in cyberspace and tech news site Ars Technica is reporting that in it the company admits that the new Xbox won't necessarily need an online connection for single-player games, playing Blu-ray discs, or streaming live TV. A rumor earlier this year claimed that the new Xbox would have to always be tethered to the Internet to work. That will come as a relief to folks with spotty connectivity, but the email -- also points to following Sony into embracing Blu-ray as the high-def optical disc platform of choice. Then we get to the "live TV" component, which suggests that Microsoft will work with your current cable provider but possibly result in Microsoft putting out its own TV service. Ever since Netflix CEO Reed Hastings left Microsoft's board of directors last year, it's been speculated that Mr. Softy was readying a play for a premium video service of its own. In this video, longtime Fool contributor analyzes the nuggets in the reportedly leaked email and concludes that Microsoft may redefine the home theater experience if it aims well this time.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368056603409</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 19:43:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368056631598-199</Id><Topic><Title>Democrats Resolve Benghazi Slaughter Once and For All</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1368042897567</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 15:54:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Abomination, you are touching new lows, Rice didn't lie, doesn't lie.

Meanwhile, the announcement is Microsoft's attempt to use seemingly good news to admit failure, by softballing step-backwards changes coming with Windows Blue. Do the Math Windows 8 shipped on October 26, but OEMs started buying licenses soon after the operating system released to manufacturing, first week of August. Being greatly generous to Microsoft, let's use October 1, start of fourth quarter, as measure of license sales. According to IDC, for the two quarters ended March 31, manufacturers shipped 166.7 million PCs (90.4 million plus 76.3 million). By the most liberal assessment, Windows 8 shipped on 60 percent of new PCs over the first six months. But the real number is much less. Microsoft's 100 million figure is to date, which means at least five more weeks of sales, and honestly, another five weeks (or more) during third quarter, as OEMs bought licenses for new PCs. Most analysts put Windows PC market share at about 90 percent. By that reckoning, Microsoft's newest OS shipped on about 66 percent of Windows PCs for the six months, although when including those missing weeks my guesstimate is, best case, 50 percent of all and 54 percent for those with Microsoft's OS. Windows Dirt Cheap Edition But wait! That's still an overly gracious measure. Microsoft offered Windows 8 dirt cheap through January 31 -- $39.95 Windows 8 Pro upgrade download, or $69.95 on DVD. The pricing is the lowest Microsoft has ever offered for the Professional product. The company doesn't disclose how many of those licenses are cheap upgrades, but reasonable guesstimate is possible. Based on Microsoft financial statements, cheap upgrade sales and volume-license ones to businesses were unusually brisk. For example, non-OEM revenue increased by 40 percent year over year during calendar first quarter (Microsoft's fiscal third). Additionally, the percentage of revenue from OEM sales fell to 65 percent. Typical level is 75 percent to 80 percent. The two figures mean an increase of license sales outside the PC channel, and one unusually high for a new version during the initial launch. Let's cut the numbers differently, for shorter time period, so we can make better use of that 65 percent OEM figure. In January, Microsoft boasted 60 million Windows 8 license sales. Three months later, the number is 40 million more, which looks good at first glance. However during first quarter -- and, again, generously ignoring that extra five weeks of calendar second quarter -- 52 percent of all PCs and 58 percent running Windows. Real numbers are more likely closer to 50 percent and 55 percent, respectively. ------------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368059634840</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 20:33:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368059681849-220</Id><Topic><Title>100M Windows 8 licenses is NOTHING</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368059634840</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 20:33:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Part 2 -------------- Apple Pie a la Mode Now let's do some comparisons to other devices. During the same 6 months, Apple sold 85 million iPhones and 42 million iPads, or more higher-profit devices than Windows 8 licenses. Most analysts now acknowledge that smartphones and tablets displace, or even replace, PC sales; from that perspective, comparison is reasonable, while granted compared straight software to hardware and software. In calendar first quarter alone, combined revenue from the two iOS devices accounted for 73 percent of Apple's $43.6 billion in revenue. Heck, revenue for just the Mac nearly matched Microsoft's Windows division -- $5.4 billion to $5.7 billion, respectively. While some commenters will argue that's an, ah, apples to oranges comparison, it represents two different business models competing for the same consumer dollars. However, when removing a one-time deferral, Windows division revenue was only $4.6 billion. So from computers representing about 5 percent of the global PC market, Apple generates more revenue than supplier of major operating system to most of the market. Windows Blue in the Face From where I sit typing this analysis, 100 million is great marketing, but much less when crunched. Strangely, the announcement means so much more. As a journalist I loathe Microsoft Q&amp;As, where one employee gets to ask another softball questions. Concurrently with the license numbers, the company posted a Q&amp;A with Tami Reller, Windows division CFO. She says the next OS version is "opportunity for us to respond to the customer feedback that we’ve been closely listening to since the launch of Windows 8 and Windows RT". That's coded-language for Microsoft stepping back from some Modern UI capabilities, and the real reason for the numbers' release: To soften the public relations blow for such action.- ----------------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368059681849</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 20:34:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368059745534-221</Id><Topic><Title>HTC R7 and R12 - two Windows Blue RT tablets....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368055695041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 19:28:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you not like cricket sound? it supposed to be soothing! :haha:</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1368059745534</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 20:35:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368060011608-222</Id><Topic><Title>Family Values In S.

At least Sanford thought he was in love.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368060011608</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 20:40:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368060315325-223</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi: Help was too far away or children running the U.S. government</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368058331343</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 20:12:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama still two weeks away at the UNITED NATIONS.....makng it look more convincing in front of a bunch of HACKS still pumping video....NOW EVERBODY SHOULD BELIEVE IT....ALL LIES....and people died....as many as in Boson....no offence</Msg><Username>trendpicker</Username><Timestamp>1368060315325</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 20:45:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368061136817-224</Id><Title>Intel chip gives new hope for Windows 8 tablets (Source C/Net)</Title><Msg>Analysts are encouraged by Intel's new Atom design.

They will be Windows 8 tablets with an update that has an internal code of Windows Blue. The updates will occur gradually with Windows update just like normal upgrades that happen with every single version of Windows. The name is not changing, that is just an upgrade name. You are really misunderstanding this update. I do not even notice most of them. The different size tiles is nice but is still is the same basic Windows 8. I have never seen a more misunderstood announcement than the update. It was misunderstood as a replacement or redo. So there are going to be a lot of people looking for something that is not there. Most will not notice anything at all.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368063815521</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 21:43:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368064094467-229</Id><Topic><Title>Intel chip gives new hope for Windows 8 tablets (Source C/Net)</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368061136817</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 20:58:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The name may change to Window 8.1 or whatever they use to distinguish the version.

Obama and Rice don't lie, never heard them lie once. Like Clinton said, what difference does it make what it's called, Americans were killed. The referencing of it on a TV show seems very important to you. Not to people without your political agenda. Like the many other terror attacks during various administrations, the authorities learn from it and move on. After 9/11 even you must have noticed they changed things. Any old fool can monday morning quarterback sittiing in a chair, and yes, that's you. You aren't qualified to safely open the door for Hilary Clinton, yet you think you have it all down on high level foreign affairs. I guarantee you will not find any job opening for you in any level of the state dept, even to clean the toilets,</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1368071101651</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-08 23:45:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
