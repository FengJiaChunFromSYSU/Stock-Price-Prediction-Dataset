Climate change, water shortages and aging populations rounded out the WEF's top five risks. The 1,000-plus experts surveyed for the Switzerland-based forum's annual risk report also warn that risk factors could combine to produce unique problems. These risk combinations included climate change putting a heavy burden on a global economy and a declining economy in turn hurting efforts to fight global warming. "These global risks are essentially a health warning regarding our most critical systems," said report editor Lee Howell, a managing director at the forum. "Resilience to global risks needs to be a priority so that critical systems continue to function despite a major disturbance." The experts also identified the global health threat from increasing resistance of germs to antibiotics. Another new worry is a "digital wildfire" of wrong or controversial information going viral across online communities, such as outrage last year in the Muslim world over an anti-Islamic film. The report's authors also noted that more and more people are living in disaster-prone areas such as coastal regions, increasing the economic costs of storms and flooding blamed on global warming</Msg><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1357650094181</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:01:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357653577027-11</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT - Important Update!</Title><Username>michaelbolden981</Username><Timestamp>1357647979009</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 07:26:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thats what i have been hearing</Msg><Username>demaiob</Username><Timestamp>1357653577027</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:59:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357654108429-12</Id><Topic><Title>This will hurt us all !!!!!</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1357650094181</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:01:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The 1993 legislation raised the top federal income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 31 percent - a huge destruction of incentives for the wealthy, according to Republican doctrine. It was signed into law on Aug. 10 of that year and the Dow closed at 3,572.73. But by the end of 1993, it was up to 3,754.09, and by the end of 1996 had risen to 6,448.26, a three-year increase of 72 percent. According to Republican legend, the market didn't take off until Republicans in Congress cut the capital gains tax in 1997. While much of the bull market did come after 1997, there is no denying that Republican predictions about the effect of the 1993 tax increase were dead wrong. I'm not going to pretend that tax increases always lead to bull markets or that tax cuts have no effect. I'm saying only that the relationship between taxes, on the one hand, and the economy and the stock market, on the other, is vastly more complex than simplistic Republican dogma would have us believe.</Msg><Username>therwnjneedhelp</Username><Timestamp>1357654108429</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 09:08:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357654515252-13</Id><Topic><Title>msft needs to lay off employee's!

(Credit: CNET/James Martin) Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer just can't stay away from the limelight at the Consumer Electronics Show. Microsoft may have given up its coveted keynote spot on the eve of the Consumer Electronics Show, but that didn't stop Ballmer from making a cameo appearance during Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs' keynote address. Ballmer stole a few moments of Jacobs' keynote to talk up Microsoft's new Windows RT and Windows 8 Phone products. Ballmer called the Windows products "stunning" additions to Microsoft's line-up. He showed off two of the newest Windows RT devices, the Samsung ATIV and Dell XPS. Both are powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon processors.

They offer touch and keyboard, which he says makes them perfect for work and play. Microsoft has put a lot of time, money, and effort promoting the new Windows RT concept. But the company's device partners have been slow to adopt the new OS, mainly because Microsoft has tried to keep tight control of it. There is no question that Microsoft is playing catch up to the Apple iPad and the Google Android tablets. And what is a tablet without apps. Ballmer talked up the fact that Microsoft has been catching up in this area. He said that the company now has four-times the number of apps for these devices as it had when it launched. In fact, he said just 10,000 new apps were added just last month. Some of these apps include, the travel app from Expedia, news apps from Huffington Post, and an e-book app like Barnes and Noble's Nook. Ballmer also showed off how the tablets can easily convert to a lightweight laptop by simply snapping on a keyboard. Ballmer also showed off some of the new Windows Phone 8 devices, including the Nokia Lumia and HTC Windows Phone 8X. He said that sales have gained momentum. "The new Windows Phones are incredible," he said. "In November, we reported that sales were four times greater than the same time last year, and during the week of Christmas, we sold five times more phones than the same week last year." Qualcomm's Jacobs pointed out that these phones are also powered by Snapdragon processors. And the execs talked up the partnership the companies have forged in taking Microsoft's products mobile.</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1357655466988</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 09:31:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357655728618-18</Id><Topic><Title>This will hurt us all !!!!!</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1357650094181</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 08:01:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>as if hawfaeces could use his head.-- even the Chicago and Austrian schools and Milton Friedman himself (the anti Keynesians ) agree that it is necessary to stimulate the economy in recessions and to pay for the deficits in boom times by fiduciary and monetary policy including higher taxes.

I can't wait to hear how bad sales were. I bet Ballmer blames the Fiscal Cliff. I don't know anybody who bought a Surface tablet for Christmas. Some pumpers tout how much better Surface Pro will be. But Surface Pro is already too late to make a difference in last quarter's earnings. Windows 8 could have decent numbers if they combine the previous quarter's deferred revenue for 'licenses sold'. How much revenue will they have for upgrade licenses that sold for only $15? Not much. Windows Phone 8 isn't as popular as Android phones or iPhone 5. So don't expect big sales numbers there. About the only thing that could help this stock would be announcing Windows 9 with Classic Desktop mode and bringing the Start Menu back. I wouldn't count on that.

In other words you're full of beans. My premiums went up $6 per mont, but not due to Obamacare. Surprising because in decades past, long before Obama, the premiums used to go up a lot more every year. Remember now, before you start in, Obamcare is a republican idea they hate now because they hate Obama. Let's remember to start with that odd flip flop they did, Sort of like when they introduce a bill and learn Obama isn't against it, then they reject their own bill on the stop.

They sell it mostly in Asia but it is sold in Europe too. So, no, msft isn't taking over mobile AND that's no fluke.

Monitor: " Ahead of and shortly after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, a number of officials, including former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz suggested the war could be done on the cheap and that it would largely pay for itself. In October 2003, Rumsfeld told a press conference about President Bush's request for $21 billion for Iraq and Afghan reconstruction that "the $20 billion the president requested is not intended to cover all of Iraq's needs. The bulk of the funds for Iraq's reconstruction will come from Iraqis -- from oil revenues, recovered assets, international trade, direct foreign investment, as well as some contributions we've already received and hope to receive from the international community." In March 2003, Mr. Wolfowitz told Congress that "we're really dealing with a country that could finance its own reconstruction." In April 2003, the Pentagon said the war would cost about $2 billion a month, and in July of that year Rumsfeld increased that estimate to $4 billion."</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1357695225613</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 20:33:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357695370630-121</Id><Topic><Title>In June 1998 $26.55 was an all time high!</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1357690550956</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 19:15:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess they never taught why split adjustments are used.

(A) It doesn't factor in earlier Windows (Vista, XP and Win7) to Win8 upgrades (B) It looks at only laptops and misses Win8 tablets as well as Surface RT (C) It is too narrow to US geography only. Most of the growth is in China, India, Brazil Microsoft's data is simply stunned me because they said not only win8 sold 60million but pretty much all of that is on top of the regular win7 sales as win7 continues to roll-out at enterprises at the steady pace of 20million/month now hitting the 60% conversion point for enterprises. Win8 and Win7 will co-exist in enterprises. The last two big surprises were the 1700 different hardware makers creating Win8 certified products and the 100million app download.

Doesn't cover world markets, tablets and may not even cover oninesale (micrsofot store, online store, surfacr sales)I haven't seen anything related to worldwide data. When enterprises toll-out win7 and win8 it doesn't mean that they buy new laptops automatically, they may choose to upgrade existing hardware. Micrsofot had a gangbuster quarter with 120Million Windows sales (60M Win8 and likely 60M win7) and you multiply that between 40 to 50 average sellingprice and you can see it was a 4.8B to 6B quarter just on windows. Add Surface, previous qurster recognition etc... Windows divsion likely grew 87% - 100% sequentially. December quarter was a block buster Q. Make no mistake.</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1357706488995</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:41:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357707352747-138</Id><Topic><Title>In June 1998 $26.55 was an all time high!</Title><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1357690550956</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 19:15:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You still can not read buffoon!</Msg><Username>dogeater20088</Username><Timestamp>1357707352747</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-08 23:55:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
