President Barack Obama faces Republican challenger Mitt Romney at the polls two days later. Weinstein co-chairman Harvey Weinstein is a prominent fundraiser for Obama’s re-election campaign, which has touted bin Laden’s death as an example of the president’s leadership. National Geographic Channel chose the film’s debut date to help promote the start of its fall season, channel President Howard T. Owens said Thursday.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349445225216</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 09:53:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349446245250-25</Id><Title>Mathematically impossibe?

(GE) Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch, writing on his Twitter account, accused the Obama administration of manipulating U.S. employment data for political advantage. Former General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch accused the Obama administration on Twitter of manipulating today’s employment data for political advantage. “Unbelievable jobs numbers..these Chicago guys will do anything..can’t debate so change numbers,” Welch, 76, said in a message posted immediately after the U.S. Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent last month, the lowest since President Barack Obama took office in January 2009. The economy added 114,000 jobs in September. The message from Welch, a supporter of Republican nominee Mitt Romney, went viral on the social-media site as political commentators and individuals weighed in. Alan Krueger, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told Bloomberg Television that the remark was “irresponsible.” Welch’s success as CEO at GE for 20 years through 2001 and as an author has made him one of the nation’s most-recognized retired business leaders. In questioning today’s jobs data, he took aim at the figures that may matter most before Election Day on Nov. 6, because the October report due on Nov. 2 may be too late to change voters’ perceptions about the economy. “His words ring louder than many others and that’s just the fact of life for a CEO, especially a well-known corporate icon type CEO that he has been,” said Peter Thies, a senior partner at Los Angeles-based executive search firm Korn/Ferry International.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1349451427490</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 11:37:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349451623822-45</Id><Topic><Title>president Obama has done well.

(More...) The stock market is celebrating the perceived strong jobs report today, but I see the rally premature and ill-advised. The gains of stocks broadly, are therefore on poor footing and should retrace after retrospection. The market is excited because if employment is truly improved by three-tenths of a percent to 7.8%, then the economy is on a better track. If more people are employed, consumer spending should improve and America's companies should see better earnings per share results. The gain to the bottom line of the P/E equation would not be the only improvement. Confidence would rise in our economy and on our outlook, and so the value given to stocks would expand on expectations of better earnings. Thus, the numerator of the P/E valuation metric would also improve. Alas, the problem is that the gains in the jobs report are suspect, at least in my view. First of all, the nonfarm payroll gain of 114K for September is nothing to write home about. Furthermore, in an earlier article, I noted that the under-employment rate was unchanged in September, even as unemployment improved. Moreover, its absolute level of 14.7% is still troubling. And the gain in the unemployment rate came on higher part-time employment, not full-time, which would be worth celebrating. Thus, any spending gains would be tempered, since part-time workers make less than full-time employees do generally. A hungry market celebrated this data for two reasons. First and foremost, at least it didn't show deterioration. Unfortunately, on a fractional basis, the under-employment rate actually deteriorated slightly. Still, with the focus of the market and the nation on the headline figure, an improvement is at least better than deterioration, even given its faults. Second, the report shows improvement on some basis, because one might say, at least more people are working, whether it be part-time or full-time. Unfortunately, on net, the change in employment to part-time also drives lower overall income produced for the economy. Stocks of cyclical companies like financials and others are higher on the day as well. These stocks have beta ratios above 1.0, indicating their sensitivity to the broader economy and market. They therefore exaggerate the moves of the market, and they are doing so today on this report. Unfortunately, given my view that the gains are suspect and on poor footing, and with a fiscal cliff, slowing global economies, and Iran confrontation ahead of us, I recommend investors sell on rallies at least through October and potentially through the close of the year, depending on the election.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1349453207634</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 12:06:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349453751492-49</Id><Topic><Title>Does Romney get Medicare or Social Security?</Title><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1349446758836</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 10:19:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everybody gets it regardless of wealth.

WBBM Newsradio’s Mike Krauser has the exclusive story. LISTEN: WBBM Newsradio’s Mike Krauser Reports David Lowery says he believes he was threatened during a phone conversation with Louis Raymond, the Illinois political director for Obama for America. Lowery says he doesn’t personally support the president because he’s not addressing issues important to the black community. He said he was explaining that to Raymond when the Obama campaign official told him, “You know what? I know everything about you.” Lowery says Raymond added, “We’ve been watching you, and since you don’t support Obama, we’ll deal with you,” before hanging up. Lowery filed a report with the Oak Forest police report, he says, “in case something happens.” He says it was suggested the NAACP should automatically back the president. Lowery notes a non-profit cannot support a particular candidate. He says it’s a clear signal the Obama campaign is concerned about the black vote. Lowery hosts an internet radio program called “Let the Truth Be Told,” where he’s made no secret of his displeasure with the president. Louis Raymond declined to comment. The Obama re-election campaign issued a written statement in response to Lowery’s claims. “Unfortunately there seems to have been a miscommunication regarding this conversation and we have since discussed with the campaign staffer in an effort to clarify the matter. The President continues to support the mission and principles of the NAACP and the work they do,” the statement said.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1349457108720</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 13:11:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349458411200-55</Id><Topic><Title>See What MSFT Shareholders Have Missed...</Title><Username>velezveronica415</Username><Timestamp>1349441408965</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 08:50:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have it already.

It will take a few seconds of getting used to this new paradigm, but it will get used to it very quickly because it appeals to natural human behavior. It is evident that an enormous amount of research has gone into Windows 8 usability. It shows. I also attended the Visual Studio 2012 "hackathon" Microsoft provided. An already amazing development environment has actually been made even more amazing. It guides you to develop software as best practices calls for: here is your data area, here is your control area, here is where you put your business model. It seems to scream for you to focus just on what you really need to work on. Microsoft has also raised the bar on quality of apps to be sold for Windows 8 to heights never seen before, even greater than that of iPhone. No junk on Windows 8, unless you're running old stuff in Win7-like mode. Speaking of phones...Microsoft has reportedly tweaked the new tablet for Skype calls. What's left to know now is the price. If the price is anywhere between $200 to $250, it seems a no-brainer to buy one...two...or for everyone in the family.</Msg><Username>serbestvatan</Username><Timestamp>1349459452117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 13:50:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349459584239-59</Id><Topic><Title>president Obama has done well.

The report found that, from August to September, the unemployment rate dropped from just above 8 percent to 7.8 percent. In fact, when Labor Secretary Hilda Solis appeared on CNBC this morning, the first two questions for her were whether the books have been cooked: Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economics adviser and the former head the Congressional Budget Office, calls the numbers "implausible." "Sept. unemployment rate fell to 7.8 percent due to an extraordinary – but implausible – estimate of 873,000 #jobs in household survey,” said Holtz-Eakin on Twitter. “The report presented a slew of contradictory data points, with the total employment level soaring despite the low net number,” said CNBC's Jeff Cox. The Washington Post's Neil Irwin adds, "Weird that payrolls are exactly on forecast but household survey is far better." And the Wall Street Journal warns that these numbers should be taken "with a grain of salt." Related Stories "The big jump in the household survey is certainly a welcome sign. But take this data with a grain of salt, especially considering the volatile reputation this data point holds,” writes the Wall Street Journal. "No way in the world these numbers are accurate," said Ed Butowsky of Chapwood Capital Investment on Fox Business. "Somebody needs to do an investigation. ... Investigate these numbers."

The $400 billion stolen in intellectual property includes: "Welcome to the World of" advertising phrase for Windows 95, Microsoft spent $350 million, Windows 95 sold over 100 million copies, a record then. I invented the lighted mouse in 1999, John Gray stole it for Michael Dell and Bill Gates, Michael Dell has pocketed over $150 billion since then. There have been attempts on my best friends life at the Westwood Pavillion mall movie theater. I spent thousands of hours with Bill Gates designing Windows Electra that they are trying to steal from me, the value is about $250 billion dollars. Windows Vista, the world's biggest selling software because of me has made Microsoft at least $70 billion. I created the Ipad design that Steve Jobs stole from me that started the tablet revolution, they want News Express also, a 24/7 live off the wries news service for $9.95 with sports, stocks and news from all over the world and live video at times. Bill Gates, John Paul Gray and Michael Dell will never steal Windows Electra software from me.

Social Security, retirement benefits, you get when you pay in. It is not your personal money anymore, you get your share if you live exactly the right time, more than your share if you live long, or less or nothing if you die.

You should be happy you'll be getting safely invested social security payments soon.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1349486926603</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:28:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349487795486-105</Id><Topic><Title>New Poll: How much Obamanure will be dished out until election day?</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349486174954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You have an unhealthy obsession with schitt.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1349487795486</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:43:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349489012981-106</Id><Topic><Title>New Poll: How much Obamanure will be dished out until election day?</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349486174954</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 21:16:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So does Obamanure!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1349489012981</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 22:03:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349489307832-107</Id><Topic><Title>The first poverty President</Title><Username>clyde54</Username><Timestamp>1349370223750</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-04 13:03:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey all you left-wingers, I have a quiz here for you: Is liberalism a symptom of ? a) Hypocrisy b) Stupidity c) Insanity d) All of the above</Msg><Username>clyde54</Username><Timestamp>1349489307832</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 22:08:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349491140496-108</Id><Title>The blood thirsty Munkey Mullah Kenyan said the Bengazi terrorist attack was</Title><Msg>... nothing more than "Work place violence."

And it's just like what's happening today, a powerful wealthy corrupt Democrat P O S controls the media (just like Soros is doing today) and tries to control the people and build a dam where they, the people, want to build a Boys Town like facility while James Stewart (like Mitt Romney) tries to stop the corrupt commie venomous Dems. Romney, the Christian American, WILL defeat the eviil blood thirsty war mongering psychotic Mullah Musllim Munkey from Kenya. Mr. Romney goes to Washington,...... and crushes the P O S Kenyan.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1349493013308</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 23:10:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349494614410-110</Id><Topic><Title>Mr. Smith goes to Washington</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1349493013308</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 23:10:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I want to explain something to you. It is not by chance or fate that things are as they are. Evil very much wants to destroy the United States. God your creator whether you believe in Him or not has provided for you. No matter how you got to be in these United States. No matter if you came as a prisoner, a slave , an indentured servant , to escape persecution or simply came - In hopes of a new beginning or better life. You have come to be blessed in His land these United States. Just as He gave you nuclear power to provide for your protection and energy needs. He has put leaders before you to guide you. He has not dictated the path you must choose. There is the hard way and the easy way. He has put before you now a man who does not desire wealth. A man who does not desire prestige or position. A man who is honest and has only a desire to fix what is broken. He does not desire a salary but wants to do for this country. He is a humble man with great gifts. He has allowed himself to be visiously attacked and but turns the other cheek. He does not have to do this but suffers so that he might serve you. To lift you up and your children and give you the future you desire. Will you embrace what has been given to you? Or will you suffer what lies ahead on the other path. Will you make a second major mistake motivated by whatever was your motivator last time? The choice is yours.</Msg><Username>knomore2</Username><Timestamp>1349494614410</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-05 23:36:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349495439892-111</Id><Title>What you really should think about</Title><Msg>I want to explain something to you.
