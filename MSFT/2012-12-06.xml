Bush spent at least $20 million taxpayer dollars just on flights to his ranch in Crawford. The right wing has been outraged at the four million dollar plus price tag for Obama’s family Christmas vacation, and they constantly hold George W. Bush up as an example of how thrifty a president should be when going on vacation. The problem is that W. wasn’t thrifty. He was the most expensive vacation president in US history. Not only did Bush spend more days on vacation than any other president, but he used Air Force One more often while on vacation than any other president." ***************************** Talking out of your nether orifice is the only talent you have, creek.

Monsarrat noted similar upside in shares of IBM IBM -0.04% and Google Inc. GOOG -0.22% when the death cross has hit those stocks. “Looking at these occurrences the data is fairly inconclusive but if it shows anything it is that a death cross implies better performance going forward,” Monsarrat wrote in an investors’ bulletin published late Wednesday.

Quoting from Wall Street Cheat Sheet: "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) can sustain its high profit margins because it behaves not like a hardware manufacturer such as Dell (NASDAQ:DELL) or Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), but like a platform company with a loyal user base, Bernstein Research’s Toni Sacconaghi said in a research note." ___________________________________ Personally, I see it a little differently. Yes, Apple is very different from either Microsoft as a primarily software-based company or Dell/HP as a primarily hardware-based company. So Apple stands to outlive any of them. On the other hand, Apple is unwilling to take all its software Open Source, even though it relies heavily on open source software as the basis of its operating system, browser, etc. So Apple already faces stiff competition from Android, which is Open Source, and can be expected to succumb eventually. Further, open source hardware looms as a cloud on the horizon.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1354813310864</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 12:01:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354813436915-49</Id><Topic><Title>Mutual Fund Quote for Fidelity Select Software &amp; Comp</Title><Username>tiamendelgzjdxrl6006</Username><Timestamp>1303058400000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-04-17 12:40:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice to be a member.</Msg><Username>josephjohn578</Username><Timestamp>1354813436915</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 12:03:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354813912467-50</Id><Title>facebook is looking at purchasing msft atlas advertising platform</Title><Msg>jowjones news</Msg><Username>guoren0312</Username><Timestamp>1354813912467</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 12:11:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354813925126-51</Id><Topic><Title>ZNGA going to $3 today, DCTH about to go nuts also, load the small profit taking dip</Title><Username>dealerschoice10</Username><Timestamp>1349704798389</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 09:59:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ZNGA CBIS MJNA</Msg><Username>candycornsyummy</Username><Timestamp>1354813925126</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 12:12:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354814468878-52</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's $4Million Hawaii vacation, it's about lack of leadership acumen</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1354806639170</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 10:10:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh, look!

Guess again... ************************************************************************* Calls to several Presidential libraries reveal that President Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, was on vacation more — 1,020 days — than any U.S. President since Herbert Hoover and possibly more than any other President in history. Even President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was in office 12 years from 1933 to 1945, was on vacation less days than President Bush at 958 days. Calls to several Presidential Libraries reveal that no President can come close to Bush’s 1,020 days on vacation in an 8 year period. Even Lyndon Johnson, who spent 484 days at his ranch in Texas and at Camp David during his presidency, came in under Bush’s vacation time. Some claim the cost of Bush’s frequent trips to Crawford, Texas cost taxpayers upwards of $20 million, but the numbers are hard to confirm. A recession started in 2001 as Bush took office after 22 million jobs were created during the Clinton Administration from 1993 to 2000. Bush began wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and presided over the loss of 4 million jobs. The debt when Bush left office was $10.6 trillion. In 2005, the Washington Post noted President Bush’s frequent vacations in a piece titled Vacationing Bush Poised to Set a Record as Bush took the longest single vacation — 5 weeks — of any President in 36 years. President Bush spent 32% of his presidency on vacation. Bush passed Reagan in total vacation days in 2005 with three and a half years left in his presidency. Reagan spent all or part of 335 days in Santa Barbara over his 8 year presidency. Bush spent 487 days at Camp David during his presidency and 490 days at his Crawford, Texas ranch, a total of 977 days. When you add the days President Bush spent at Kennebunkport, Maine, he spent a total of 1,020 days away from the White House — close to 3 years. At 1,020 days, Bush was close to being on vacation more days than President John F. Kennedy’s total days in office (1,036). Representatives at the Nixon and Johnson Libraries indicate those two Presidents were on vacation less than 1,000 days during their terms. President Obama has been on vacation 78 days from 2009 to 2011. At the three year mark into their first terms, George W. Bush spent 180 days at his ranch in Crawford, Texas and Ronald Reagan spent 112 vacation days at his ranch in California. Of course, staff was around all three Presidents on vacations and all White House aides argue that the commander-in-chief is never “out of touch” with work. Calls to the Eisenhower and Truman Libraries reveal that those Presidents were not on vacation for more than 1,020 days. Eisenhower was on vacation for 456 days during his 8 years in office. When asked on whether President Herbert Hoover’s vacation days could be over 500 for 4 years a historian at the Hoover Library said, “No chance. Everyone agrees he was a grinder — he was the kind of guy for whom a vacation was rare — his vacation days were less than 50.” Hoover was in office from 1929 to 1933. Frequently Hoover either drove himself on brief trips or was driven by a military attachment or took the train. President Obama was on vacation for 26 days during his first year in office (2009). Ronald Reagan spent 42 days on vacation during his first year in office (1981). President George H.W. Bush was on vacation less than his son, 40 days, in 1989, his first year in office. President Obama was on vacation less in his first year in office than the previous three Republican Presidents. No President since Reagan was on vacation less than Bill Clinton. Presidents Clinton and Carter vacationed the least of any of the last seven chief executives. **********************************************************************************</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1354826041311</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 15:34:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354826148859-88</Id><Topic><Title>Is MSFT the real deal?</Title><Username>glenncedric771</Username><Timestamp>1354804533479</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 09:35:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Big shorts are eyeing this baby and so are the day traders.

I bought the 822 Nokia Lumina from Verizon on the pre order. Best phone/Experience I have ever had. I leave my apple device home now. I do not need to carry a camera. Better pictures from the phone!!! I do not need a car GPS. The phone has built in voice assisted turn by turn directions for car, Bus or walking!!! online &amp; . offline. Yes offline! The touch screen works with gloves. Full browser just flick my finger and can run a business on the phone. I have 9 pop 3 emails. Beams photos from my phone to any screen with a internet connection like a movie projector. It is bullet proof for dropping. W8 phones are just plain cool!

What are the best features of Android? A permanently on-screen Back button. A permanently on-screen Home button. Neither of these are present on the Windows 8 “tablet screen”. Every app developer implements the “Back” feature in a manner and location of his or her own choosing (Microsoft apps seem to put a big arrow on the top left of the screen; other developers used the bottom left; many screens do not have a Back option at all). What is the best feature of iOS on the iPad? A permanent hardware Home button. It isn’t as convenient as going “Back” on Android but at least it facilitates re-navigating to wherever you were. The closest thing to a full-time Home button in Windows 8 is the “windows” key on the keyboard (but the whole idea is that the keyboard is not always available/required). What is the best feature of Windows XP/Vista/7? Click right on an object to get a context-dependent menu of useful functions. Android copied this feature: touch and hold an item in order to get a context-dependent menu of options. The Windows 8 tablet interface lacks this interface standard. Microsoft has had since October 2008 to study Android. It has had since June 2007 to study iPhone. It seems as though they did not figure out what is good about the standard tablet operating systems. One thing that Android and iOS do not address is how to handle the requirement of offering a legacy Xerox Alto-style mouse and windows environment. Microsoft here integrates the tablet and the standard Windows desktop in the most inconvenient and inconsistent possible way. Due to the desperation of the average consumer to watch television at all times on all devices, the typical computer screen is fairly wide. One would think therefore that it would be possible to use traditional applications in the left-hand two-thirds of the screen while running a tablet environment on the right-hand one-third of the screen. Windows 8 does not allow this. It is either the old Windows XP desktop or the new Android-like tablet environment. As far as I can tell they cannot be mixed except that a tablet app can be set to appear in a vertical ribbon on the left or right edge of the screen. A reasonable user might respond to this dog’s breakfast of a user interface by trying to stick with either the familiar desktop or the new tablet. However, this is not possible. Some functions, such as “start an application” or “restart the computer” are available only from the tablet interface. Conversely, when one is comfortably ensconced in a touch/tablet application, an additional click will fire up a Web browser, thereby causing the tablet to disappear in favor of the desktop. Many of the “apps” that show up on the “all apps” menu at the bottom of the screen (accessible only if you swipe down from the top of the screen) dump you right into the desktop on the first click. Confused about how the tablet apps work and want to Google for the answer? You go to a Web browser in the desktop interface and can’t see the tablet interface that you’re getting advice on how to use. Keep your old Windows 7 machine adjacent so that you can Google for “How to use Windows 8″ on the old computer and have the pages continuously visible. The only device that I can remember being as confused by is the BlackBerry PlayBook. I would find this machine a lot more useful if it simply ran Android as a sub-environment and did so in the right-hand third of the screen. Comments from those who love Windows 8 would be especially appreciated. To end on a high note, some of the supplied apps are wonderful, e.g., the Bing Finance app. Swiping back and forth on a 27-inch screen is a great way to get a comprehensive picture of a lot of information quickly. (Of course, this would be equally true if one had a similar app on a 27-inch Android tablet… it is just that there aren’t any high-res 27-inch Android devices of which I am aware.) [This article is based on using Windows 8 on what may be the best current hardware: Dell XPS One 27 computer with a quad-core i7 CPU, 16 GB of RAM and a solid state hard drive accelerator ($2600). I will try to write a bit about the Dell hardware in a subsequent posting. The screen is beautiful. The supplied keyboard is tiny, as if made for a clown. The display tilts down easily, making it easy to get up from one's chair to read a web page while standing.] [Separate issue: Given how misguided the whole design of Windows 8 seems to be, why have tech journalists given it basically positive reviews? My theory is that journalists love anything new, different, and complicated. Windows 8 is all of those things.] ==============================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1354843253541</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 20:20:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354844316215-108</Id><Topic><Title>Gallup: Seasonal adjusted unemployment back to 8.3% How "con" veeeeeenient, ...</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1354836432155</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 18:27:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And Gallup had Romney up by 7% with less tha a week to go.How did those #s match up on 11/6</Msg><Username>whatgozaround</Username><Timestamp>1354844316215</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-06 20:38:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354845464181-109</Id><Title>A day will come where you will be able to play X-box games on a Nokia Windows Phone</Title><Msg>My guess is that within the next 3 to 4 years, Nokia phones will be powerful enough to support X-box games and MSFT will unify X-Box and Windows Phone...
