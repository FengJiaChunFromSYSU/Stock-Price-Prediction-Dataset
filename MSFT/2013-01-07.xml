Notice how just when the economy is primed to take off, Mitch McConnel under orders from Grover Norquist will threaten to kill negotiations? Whether it's the fiscal cliff or the up coming debt ceiling, McConnel threatens to shut down government to default. The default scenerio is scaring business and kills hiring. This is no coincedence. This is being orchestrated by the K0ch Bros thru their lobbyist Grover Norquist. Suppression of the economy is the K0ch Bros political tactic.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1357567869657</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 09:11:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357567897184-9</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Challenges Google's Practices in Europe</Title><Username>tamekaankromfozuxeo834</Username><Timestamp>1301842690000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2011-04-03 10:58:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I will be expecting for more news.</Msg><Username>kevinwinsten</Username><Timestamp>1357567897184</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 09:11:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357568463727-10</Id><Topic><Title>I think we can be thankful to President Obama for the growing economy</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1357526610673</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-06 21:43:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're off by 3 zeroes on the debt.

Nice up sell. LOL. Easy enough to look up top sellers on web sites go see what has been selling and what's not. This seems to be the year of the cheap laptop from what I'm looking at, low margin brand builders. Not a good sign for some one trying to sell $120 covers.</Msg><Username>creephhi</Username><Timestamp>1357598971263</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 17:49:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357599791561-73</Id><Topic><Title>Picking up tomorrow....</Title><Username>kurtis4hyr</Username><Timestamp>1357593741775</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 16:22:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"bulls make money;bears make money;pigs make nothing"..why wait for 29....take some off the table!</Msg><Username>jamesbuck2</Username><Timestamp>1357599791561</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:03:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357599992113-74</Id><Title>If Microsoft gets in bed with Samsung, $35/share will look cheap!</Title><Msg>Just sayin.</Msg><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1357599992113</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:06:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357602033332-75</Id><Topic><Title>If Microsoft gets in bed with Samsung, $35/share will look cheap!</Title><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1357599992113</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:06:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IMO, it will happen.</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1357602033332</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:40:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357602114524-76</Id><Topic><Title>If Microsoft gets in bed with Samsung, $35/share will look cheap!</Title><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1357599992113</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:06:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In fact, it will be a perfect marriage at least in terms of this particular combo.

At its press event Monday at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Samsung KR:005930 -0.33% showcased a new line of PC laptop products running the Windows 8 operating system from Microsoft MSFT +0.11% , as part of an effort to start “bringing the ‘wow’ back to PCs,” as Samsung executive Michael Abary put it onstage at the event, which was Webcast. He introduced the new Series 7 lineup of so-called ‘ultrabooks’ — which are thin laptops. This included the Series 7 Chronos, an aluminum-body, touch-enabled computer barely 0.8 inches thick with a 15.6-inch screen, and the even-thinner Series 7 Ultra with a 13.3-inch screen. Samsung also seems to be planning a bigger push into the enterprise. The company predicted Monday that the bring-your-own-device, or BYOD, trend will grow this year. This is when business users buy their own mobile devices themselves for use on corporate networks. Samsung touted a new software pack offering called Samsung Safe designed to increase the appeal of its devices in the enterprise. And — like its peers at CES — the company spent much of its time on TVs, including its first in the so-called ultra-HD line that offers resolution up to four times the amount of today’s LED screens. The company also offered up an “evolution kit” that consumers can use to make a 2012 set compatible with the company’s latest Web-TV offerings.</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1357602704895</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 18:51:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1357602728769-78</Id><Title>i see the hyper intelligent rwnj are here again providing advice</Title><Msg>despite not understanding averaging.

[[Too bad the younger generation doesn't remember the "Evil Empire" of the Soviets.]] Do you recall if you are over 40 how the eeeevil of communism was put up as a severe danger to the USA and we fought the Korean and Vietnam wars to stop the spread of this eeeevilll system of government. If so do have you ever been lectured about how "weak" this system of government is and that it eventually fails in every attempt to thrive. Well if so have you ever wondered why we spend lots of money to 'weaken' a political force that we also believe is self destructive anyway. Oh the military industrial complex must be allowed to breath i guess, and the rest of us should just focus on our workplace raises and what is new for sale at the department store.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1357603224822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 19:00:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357604393935-80</Id><Topic><Title>The S#$%$ is not selling</Title><Username>creephhi</Username><Timestamp>1357598971263</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 17:49:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Word on the street is creep is a lowlife lying shetbag.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1357604393935</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 19:19:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1357605518504-81</Id><Topic><Title>another rwnj funny. the 'evil empire'</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1357603224822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-07 19:00:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I forgot to tag on another conservative religious viewpoint Military power comes with economic power.
