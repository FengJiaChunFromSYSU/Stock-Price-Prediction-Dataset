The public wants the next new thing and the iPhone platform is getting pretty stale. All they are doing is refreshing the product. There is no revolutionary change in it. Apple just expects to be able to slap some cosmetic changes on the device and then charge more than everyone else for it. WP8 phones are brand new. They have cool factor because they are a great product and it is new. People want something brand new when they spend money not something stale. 2) Apples decision to build a new connector into the iPhone just made a bunch of devices that iPhone 4 users have bought useless. I know iPhone (Apple fanboys) who have told me they are sticking with their 4 and 4s's because they dont' want to upgrade all the little devices that bought that use the old connector. Yes you can buy an adapter but it doesn't look cool hanging off your iPhone.</Msg><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1355581718273</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 09:28:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355581815011-12</Id><Topic><Title>RIMM</Title><Username>craypucks</Username><Timestamp>1355519574495</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 16:12:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bad idea, Blackberry is so yesterday.</Msg><Username>stockdox</Username><Timestamp>1355581815011</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 09:30:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355581868927-13</Id><Title>Mark Penn is one of the heros for truth in American society</Title><Msg>The hateful liars who don't even have a rational motive for bashing Microsoft- liars like wotowwootow need to have their butts kicked for polluting the national discourse whether it is political or whether it is computer technology</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1355581868927</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 09:31:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355581927955-14</Id><Topic><Title>Got More XP Updates Today</Title><Username>cyber_critiquer</Username><Timestamp>1355515654343</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 15:07:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Fine, if you are happy using yesterday's technology.

Exclusivity contracts are becoming the norm in the industry. Get used to it. All the hot new phones have exclusivity agreements. iPhones had them with ATT and that was locked up for years. I think the Nokia 920 one is only 6 months. Only thing that distinguishes one carrier from another is the phones they offer and so that is why carriers like them. They want people to switch to them so they can get the phones. That is why phones are subsidized. Wow where have you been? Windows RT isn't the full version, although it shares the same kernel. But who is better? I have a Android and I can't use MS apps on it. I am stuck with whatever Google decides I can use. Also the Android tablet can't network with my PC. Yes, I can use some apps to get it to talks so I can grab a few files but that is it. iPad doesn't use the same OS as their MAC so you can't use a Mac app on a iPad.

'“My estimate is that power users will not have higher productivity with Windows 8 than they did with Windows 7,” he says. “I fear that they will have lower productivity.” '</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1355588937469</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 11:28:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355589332354-33</Id><Topic><Title>80 Million Guns In America - Thanks NRA</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1355585028369</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 10:23:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They were saying 280 million guns</Msg><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1355589332354</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 11:35:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355589491713-34</Id><Topic><Title>Today's tragedy breaks my heart too, but talk is of the weapon rather than the reality</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1355547330201</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 23:55:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guns are made for killing, it isn't a car that happened at these shooting scenes.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1355589491713</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 11:38:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355589632153-35</Id><Topic><Title>Today's tragedy breaks my heart too, but talk is of the weapon rather than the reality</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1355547330201</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-14 23:55:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guns are made for killing, it isn't a car accident that happened at these shooting scenes.

Car accidents are not called that anymore in hospitals and among law enforcement, did you know that? They are called "crashes" and "wrecks." THey are generally the result of poor judgement and/or lack of skill. They don't "just happen." Second, guns are designed to launch projectiles, not "to kill" as you hysterically say. Most privately owned arms are used with regularity, and yet somehow they manage not to kill anyone. If guns "killed", you'd be reading about far more often. The problem is insanity and violent behavior, engendered by a society that glamorizes killing in the mass media, treats life more cheaply all the time (witness Roe v Wade and all the slippery slope since), and most important IMO, one that has reduced the individual to a cog in the collective. Solve those problems and you might make some headway. Until then, the same old liberal rhetoric about gun control is just that.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1355613544096</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 18:19:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355615605339-52</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft says adapting to Windows 8 takes at most two weeks</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1355588937469</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 11:28:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The problem is that MS thinks it has the power to require computer users to adapt to Win 8. And see, MS wants computer desktop users to help make Win 8 popular on mobile phones. At an event in Silicon Valley that was blogged by reporters, SB said that inovation comes from the top. Of course we all know that it is orders that comes from the top. And the new corporate mantra, after one executive left, is said to be something like teamwork. Of course that means support for the top. SB also said that IT departments simply decide the computer usage of companies. Of course we know that the IT departments are accountable to the companies that they work for. And SB said that MS is all-in on Win 8. Again, this is belief in the power to direct the marketplace rather than responding to the marketplace. This CEO that says and thinks such strange things has probably just cracked under the pressure. And so Win 8 has been put at risk by a strategy of implementing it on devices other than tablets.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1355615605339</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 18:53:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355616897721-53</Id><Title>The Koch Bros Sycophants Will Have A VERY Busy MMGW Denial Season</Title><Msg>Bloomberg By Alex Morales - Dec 14, 2012 1:27 PM CT UN Leak Shows More Evidence Humans Cause Global Warming (excerpt) This report further confirms that there really is no doubt about the fact that the Earth is warming, and there is no reasonable doubt that greenhouse-gas emissions from human activities are the primary driver of that warming,” “More than half of the total carbon emitted by human activities has been taken up by the ocean and the land since 1750. The remainder has caused an increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration by over 40 percent since 1750, and by about 10% since 1990.” Antarctica - There is “very high confidence” that man-made carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater is causing “gradual acidification.” - “There is very high confidence that the Greenland Ice Sheet has lost mass since the early 1990s, and that the rate of loss has increased.” - There is “high confidence” the Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. - Based on evidence from ice cores, there is “very high confidence” that the concentration of carbon dioxide is 30 percent higher now than during the past 800,000 years. The methane concentration is 125 percent higher. - The global average surface temperature will “likely” be 0.4 to 1 degree Celsius (0.7 to 1.8 degree Fahrenheit) higher from 2016 through 2035 than during the two decades through 2005.

Poor wally, still shilling to no avail....

Also the build quality is lacking - after only a couple of weeks the touch cover was falling to pieces. How long have you owned it: A month or less Bottom Line No, I would not recommend this to a friend.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1355631207508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-15 23:13:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
