Quoting: "Microsoft's (MSFT) Windows 8 was supposed to spark an increase in personal computer sales. Instead, the PC industry is poised to contract for the second year in a row. And Windows 8 actually could be hurting PC sales. "Market research firm IDC this week slashed its 2013 PC shipment forecast. It now expects worldwide PC shipments to decline 1.3% this year over 2012, when PC shipments fell 3.7%. IDC had previously expected PC sales to rise 2.8%, but the predicted bump from Windows 8 didn't materialize. "IDC blamed the PC shipment declines on competition from tablets, especially Apple's (AAPL) iPad, and a continuing economic malaise that has crimped IT budgets.

This will cause a backlash among the whites.. The white supremacists will take advantage of the discontent and they will receive widespread support. I predict that in less than four years, racial tensions will increase to levels never seen since the turbulent 1960's. Obama will set the clock back decades. America is the bastion of freedom. The peace of the world depends on the strength of America , and its weakness translates into the triumph of terrorism and victory of rogue nations.

The bright spot for Windows 8 in the data from Web analytics company Net Applications: Its share of all Windows PCs increased in March by a larger margin than the month before, reversing a trend of declining growth since the OS launched in October. According to Net Applications, Windows 8's March usage share -- including what the firm labeled as "touch" for Windows 8 and Windows RT -- was 3.6% of all Windows PCs, up from February's 3%. Windows 8's share increase in March was six-tenths of a percentage point, larger than February's gain of five-tenths of a point. From November -- the first full month after Windows 8's launch -- through February, the operating system's increases had grown smaller each month. =============================================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1364854817872</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 18:20:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364854944907-29</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft's Windows 8 turning off PC buyers</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1364843050294</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 15:04:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>W8 really is a total lemon.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1364854944907</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 18:22:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1364854980277-30</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Takes Over #6 Spot From General Electric</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1364851984168</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-01 17:33:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are weak and sick.
