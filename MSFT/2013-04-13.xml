When many of these kids, forced to be born by the heavy hand of big conservative government grow up, if they make it through the catastrophic, dysfunctional, brutal upbringing, then it's pay back for society in the form of home invasions, robbery, murder etc. Look no further than the Dr. Pettit case in Connecticut to see what the far right is attempting to foist upon society in the name of their religion. Ask any of your pro life friends if they would be willing to have their taxes raised to care for the feeding of a new born whose mother already has four other welfare children, the answer in most cases would be no, they want them born, but they don't want to provide the money to care for them.

Some of these cannot be screened successfully by Google themselves in the Google Play store. So what do we have? If you own a Android OS phone you are being spied on, used as a gateway to your employer or used to generate google ad clicks. So let's look at the last one 'being used to generate ad click revenue on google ads. That means there are criminals using your browser to go to web sites and click a google paid ad. The so called criminal generate money by placing google ad sense ads themselves. This allows other peoples ads to be displayed on their own website. They get a portion of the money every time someone click the paid ad and google get's the rest. The looser is the business that pays advertising and is being clicked on by malware bots with not interest in buying anything that the advertiser hoped to sell. Google has said they are Russian organized crime placing malware in apps and you download an app or it is pre installed and you phone or computer is accessing pages and clicking on ads without you knowing it. Google has indicated that 20% are not able to be detected by Google screening prior to shipping the device or letting it be downloaded in the google play store. Really? Possibilities: 1.) It is like google says, they simply cannot detect it even though Microsoft can and does not have the same problem. 2.) Google is actually not attempting to make Android 100% safe as they are earning Billions of dollars in these phony bogus ad clicks. They are making un imaginable amounts of money on this scam. 3.) Ex or current google engineers who know the system are involved. Everyone Else but Google has been able to manage this problem Apple &amp; Microsoft do not have the malware in the stores, phones or machines. So we all know that the Android OS is given away for free &amp; Linux based. Does the FBI need to see if maybe it is not so free after all. I think so.</Msg><Username>msftstockmachine</Username><Timestamp>1365862797901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 10:19:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365866649044-16</Id><Topic><Title>Should the FBI INVESTIGATE GOOGLE THEMSELVES</Title><Username>msftstockmachine</Username><Timestamp>1365862797901</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 10:19:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>test</Msg><Username>peterwalker1963</Username><Timestamp>1365866649044</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 11:24:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365868363954-17</Id><Title>WINDOWS 8, where is the start link, from where you can find everything quickly?, endless problem with basic computing softwares,</Title><Msg>Torture to navigate, everything that made Windows popular, easy to use for an average person, is gone.

Quoting: "Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Windows 8 is totally killing the PC market. As if PC shipments weren't already stagnating, Windows 8 just knocked unit volumes down for the count. "The 14% decline in the first quarter that IDC estimated is the worst quarterly contraction in nearly 20 years. There were initial indications that Windows 8 wasn't taking off, such as when IDC pegged fourth-quarter PC units at negative 6.4%. The new operating system was released about a month into that quarter, so it was fair to say then that Windows 8 maybe just needed some time. It was simply too early to call it for sure. "Well, we can now call it for sure: Windows 8 has bombed. Don't just take my word for it. IDC's Bob O'Donnell makes it quite clear: " At this point, unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market. While some consumers appreciate the new form factors and touch capabilities of Windows 8, the radical changes to the UI, removal of the familiar Start button, and the costs associated with touch have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices. Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market. "Windows 8 was a huge risk. It was a risk that Microsoft needed to take in the face of lackluster global PC shipments, but after five months on the market, the data show that consumers just aren't buying into Microsoft's vision, literally and figuratively. Users want the Start Menu back; some certified technicians even offer services to downgrade brand-new PCs back to Windows 7 (that'll be $125, please), allowing users to go back to the familiar interface and embrace of that OS." __________________________________________ I'm not making it up, folks.

Maybe think again (Don't forget to buy an actual XBOX next one will be special) it is a multimedia FUN ZONE. The smart DJ kicks in and recommends songs I might like based on my search. You never heard the way these songs sounded back in the day. Every single instrument pops and it is musical gold. Your going to remember sitting in your room puffing in high school thinking it never sound so good then or I never heard that before. In case you got caught in the talk radio boom listening to all talk the songs have been re-mastered. In case you do not like it there is a mixer where you can mix two different songs together on your own. Yea buddy Windows 8 will be the best musical entertainment experience of your life. I bought the bose as a test. The bose have wires that have to be plugged into my touch screen Windows 8 laptop (get a touchscreen laptop, don't wait run or Surface Pro). Today trying wireless speaker system that connects via my wifi (NO WIRES COOL). The bose have a subwoofer and two speakers. I do not think the sound can be any better than bose.

When they buy things it helps the economy. Conversely, when wealth is concentrated in great amounts held by a relatively few number of people there is a lack of wealth distribution; and most people have little discretionary spending power. They don't buy as much; so the economy slows down. That is what had been happening for the last 35 years. It is better for the economy for most people to be doing fairly well than it is for a few to be doing extremely well and most people just getting by. Therefore, in order to improve our economy we should be looking for ways to reduce wealth inequality. Raising the minimum wage is one way to ensure that the lower paid workers have more buying power. Another way would be to limit the income of the executives of large corporations to a multiple of their average workers income. Breaking up the largest corporations and banks so that there is more competition in markets would also help. Increased unionization also reduces wealth inequality. It would be very beneficial to take away the special treatment the biggest banks get from the Federal Reserve and allow market forces to work naturally. "The primary mechanism for uploading wealth is debt-based creation of new money under the system of fractional reserve lending under the central control of the private bank-owned Federal Reserve, which supplies money, at interest, to the U.S. Government. Commercial banks create electronic entry money when they make loans, typically up to ten times the amount in their reserves. This contributes to cyclical asset hyperinflation bubbles and busts, in which the Big Five money-center banks are key players and from which the super-wealthy emerge relatively wealthier. This has resulted in a virtually permanent super-elite." "In 2007 the richest 1% of the American population owned 34.6% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 50.5%.
