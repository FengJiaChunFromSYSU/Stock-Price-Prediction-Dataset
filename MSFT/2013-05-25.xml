Not only did she call sell right before MSFT turned in a fantastic quarter setting the stock on fire for the first time in 5 years, but she seems to be solely focused on Windows 8 and perfectly content to ignore MSFT's other 11 profit centers, not to mention that Windows 8 is a fraction of Windows profits. MSFT trades at just 11x next years earnings. Tablet share is on the rise. The cloud biz is growing like wild. XBox One is coming. And so much more is going on with Mr. Softy. MSFT's profits are large and growing, and they have tons of cash, and the share price is a joke and fair value is clearly somewhere between $50 - $90.</Msg><Username>douglas7white</Username><Timestamp>1369485607466</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 08:40:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369486529319-6</Id><Topic><Title>Heather Bellini To Raise Her PT To $50.00 For MSFT....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1369440639728</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 20:10:39 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You see the smart analysts "without an agenda" have been saying this all along and have upped their PTs and now even Motley is starting to tune in to what I have been saying for the past couple of months....

Undeniable fact, she signed the papers. "Guilty before proven innocent..." You being from the old eastern Soviet bloc clearly do not understand American law. A person is guilty of a crime the instant they commit a crime. They are not held accountable "in the eyes of the law" (a significant variant in wording from your wrong ideas) until proven accountable "in the eyes of the law" (in a courtroom). If you plan and kill another, you are guilty, you are indeed a felon as soon as the crime is done, going into a courtroom does not make you a felon, you are already a felon but you are not a "convicted felon" until so ruled in a court. You commies never could understand the difference.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1369501268367</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-05-25 13:01:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369501512552-29</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT short Interest As of May 15/2013....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1369428511999</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-24 16:48:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You don't strike me ..."
