That's called "Tolerance Stacking" anyone that thinks it will is stupid. If enough were cut (16 is not enough to come up with a meaniful value) variation will not be enough to conclude random or gaussian. Depending on the process you can get EITHER result. Precision and accuracy. Dart board for example. I hit the board 16 times I am accurate. I cluster in number 10 16 times I am precise. I hit bulls eye 16 times I am both accurate and precise. The central limit theorem was not stated properly either. I don't remember who said it. The central limit theorem is the larger the sample size the more representative it is of the population. I am just trying to figure where you guys are going in terms of the mathematical bickering. As a CQE (certified quality engineer) I now and understand all the buzz words being thrown around.

The whole point of statistics is that you can't know the true mean or the true range of the data but can only estimate it by sampling. Your results are "true" within a range of confidence. You want to start by saying your "true" average is 10, thus only 2 significant digits. I say if you already know the "true" mean is 10, why do you need statistics? I say we are building a nuclear reactor and need measurements of 10 mm to a precision of seven significant digits, thus 10.0000000 mm */- 0.00000005 mm. OK?

If your measuring gizzmo is only accurate to 1/100th of a mm what is the point of a statistically accurate "mean" to the 1/1000000th of a mm? Is this a meaningful result? In the real world you will have to round it to the nearest 1/100th anyway. If you make 1000 sets of independent measurements and discover that your statistically accurate, gaussian, mean has increased (or decreased) by 3/1000000ths of a mm, is this a meaningful, significant, result? *** Then on to global warming. And please be aware that I AM familiar with the underlying data, most rounded to the nearest 1/10th degree F. And much of it of mediocre quality, such that there are endless lists of "corrections".... So what is the significance of a 0.4 degree C estimated change over a century? Or even a 0.7 degree C change over a century? Especially when we know that people are massaging the data to get results they desire...

And 16 pieces is adequate to prove the point. There is an error in measuring each piece. And there is an error in cutting each piece. (The saw blade "eats" some of the wood from each cut piece.) If you do the measuring and cutting as I've described, your final cut pieces will likely be way off the correct size. Each of the 16 pieces will be a different size. They will not work in your project. You will need to go buy more 2X4s and start over. To solve this problem, measure &amp; cut the first piece. Test it for fit. Then mark it "pattern" with your carpenter's pencil. Use your "pattern" to measure and cut each additional piece, and you are much more likely to make and cut 16 pieces that will work in your project. This is practical world experience, which I think cfurry lacks.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358064995448</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 03:16:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358065414920-20</Id><Topic><Title>I will prove that averaging is more accurate than applying sig digs to averages</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1358041424581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-12 20:43:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>PS: Yes, if you cut maybe 1600 pieces you will get into enough pieces to calculate "credibility" for the tolerance variations of each piece.

A company was trying to introduce western manufacturing concepts to Japan (long ago.) There were several factories in several cities, each of which had to manufacture mechanical parts to extremely close tolerances. The company trained everybody to use western tools. Trained them how to measure and then set them to manufacturing the mechanical parts. OOOPS! The Parts were all wrong! The sizes were all WRONG! Some were way off! But each factory reported making parts within reasonable tolerances of the correct size. But the final parts varied widely from factory to factory. It was finally recognized that nobody had taught the factory workers to coordinate their tools to all the same tolerances! After each factory synchronized their tools to each other, everything was fine.

I agree with this in theory but still question it as a practical result. If your thermometer can only measure to 1/10th degree, what is the practical value of a calculation that averages averages to 1/1000th of a degree? It's too small to measure, which is why you have the significant digits in the first place. Should we really change global economic policy based on changes to the 1/1000th degree that we can not measure accurately in the real world?</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358090838582</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 10:27:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358091625864-33</Id><Title>What is the average global temperature now?</Title><Msg>Google on the topic phrase! According to NCAR/UCAR University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (Sorry, URLs are not permitted in the new Yahoo format.) Climatologists prefer to combine short-term weather records into long-term periods (typically 30 years) when they analyze climate, including global averages. Between 1961 and 1990, the annual average temperature for the globe was around 57.2°F (14.0°C), according to the World Meteorological Organization. In 2011, the global temperature was about 0.74°F (0.41°C) above that long-term average, according to the WMO's estimates. That number made 2011 the 10th warmest year on record within a database going back to 1850. But among years with La Niña events under way (which typically cool the climate), 2011 was the warmest on record. Why are global temperatures expressed as a departure from normal, instead of a simple global temperature? One reason is that there are several different techniques for coming up with a global average, depending on how one accounts for temperatures above the data-sparse oceans and other poorly sampled regions. Since there is no universally accepted definition for Earth’s average temperature, several different groups around the world use slightly different methods for tracking the global average over time, including: NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies NOAA National Climatic Data Center UK Met Office Hadley Centre The important point is that the trends that emerge from year to year and decade to decade are remarkably similar—more so than the averages themselves. This is why global warming is usually described in terms of anomalies (variations above and below the average for a baseline set of years) rather than in absolute temperature. A website from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies goes into more detail on the topic of The Elusive Absolute Surface Air Temperature.</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358091625864</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 10:40:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358091866795-34</Id><Topic><Title>What is the average global temperature now?</Title><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358091625864</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 10:40:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>NOTICE: Since there is no universally accepted definition for Earth’s average temperature, several different groups around the world use slightly different methods for tracking the global average over time, . . .

Civil engunear creek is tasked with building a automated gauge to spit out water level at lake brownwater but he is completely out of his league with this so he asks his buddy goober who is a lectric engunear to help him build the device. The client wants only the lake level not any info about waves so goober finds a sensor that outputs voltage for the height of the water and mounts it properly. Then he feeds dis voltage into a computer that digitizes the water height with a twelve bit A/D converter which gives numbers between 0 and 4095 which corresponds to a range of -10 feet to plus 10 feet in the water level. Now goober decides to read in 100 level measurements over a 10 minute period and use these 100 measurements to estimate the lake level. Now is the best course of action A Average these 100 readings and use this result B Some other method Creeky what would you do with the 100 measurements to give the best estimate. Say in one batch the lowest reading was 4.73 feet and the highest was 6.35 with a mean of 5.14 feet.

It may be sufficiently accurate to say the average is 5.1 feet with a range of 4.7 feet to 6.4 feet. It may also be sufficiently accurate (depending on our purpose) to say the lake level is between 4 and 7 feet with an average of about 5 feet. Of course we could also question weather a 10 minute time period is significant. The lake might be much lower during the August dry season and higher during the April spring flood. We may also wish to do a normal curve of our 100 measurements to get a minus 1 sigma to plus 1 sigma range too. This would give us an expected range for about 2/3rds of the time. Which may be sufficient in most cases. For what purpose do we care about the water level in the lake? Presumably we wish to keep the water IN the lake. Presumably we might estimate that if we built a 7 foot retaining wall we could expect to keep the water in the lake almost all the time (based on our short 10 minute time period.) Are we worried about cattle drinking from the lake? If the water level is under 4.5 feet the cattle maybe unable to drink. Should we plan to pump water into the lake? I calculate that we would need 11 sixteen inch cement blocks to build a retaining wall at least 7 feet high. (Do remember that a 16 inch cement block is 7 5/8th inches high.) Maybe we should have a foundation too and coping on top. How long will this retaining wall need to be? Will it be supported from the rear? Or are we building a pool for cooling nuclear power rods near a nuclear power plant in Japan? We may have other thoughts to consider! Will it matter if we get a 30 meter */- 3 meter, tsunami wave after a 9.0 */- 0.5 magnitude undersea earth quake, with a return period of 300 years?</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358099088193</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 12:44:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358099575902-46</Id><Topic><Title>babababababab</Title><Username>nationalrollerbearingmonth</Username><Timestamp>1358095810279</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 11:50:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>cfury, don't go all intellectual on us now!</Msg><Username>bullwinkle.themoose</Username><Timestamp>1358099575902</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 12:52:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358100272846-47</Id><Topic><Title>Yeah i posed the wrong problem again.

""Why should the rules for propagating significant digits not be applied to averages?"" In this article the author states. ****************** IIf you dutifully follow the guidelines, your reasoning goes something like this: Adding up the weights gives a total weight of 763.6 lbs, which has 4 significant figures. To get the average, divide by 5. The 5 is an exact number, so you don't lose any significant figures by doing this. The exact answer is 152.72 lbs The answer rounded to 4 digits is 152.7 lbs. That implies that you know the weight to the nearest tenth of a pound. But do you really know the weight this precisely? Is the tenths place really the first uncertain digit? This is one of those cases where you have to keep the definition of significant figures in mind. You have a series of replicated measurements, so you can see that the precision implied by the scale isn't the same as the precision you're actually getting, because the person is balancing themselves slightly differently every time. Even though the measuring device has a scale that allows you to read to the nearest 10th of a pound, the measurements are changing in pounds place. Pounds are the first uncertain digit, so the reported weight should be 153 lbs. ***************** Do you agree with this?? I certainly would not as it leads to the result being dependent on the most erroneous measurement.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1358121544596</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 18:59:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358138721116-77</Id><Topic><Title>Opposing citizens possessing weapons because you think it unnecessary is like</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1358134820106</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-01-13 22:40:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Unrelated dot connecting.
