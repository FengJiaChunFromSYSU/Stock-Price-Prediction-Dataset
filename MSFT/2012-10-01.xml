Answer: The press lets him get away with it. How could a president who campaigned on the need to change Washington from the inside now say change has to come from outside? Answer: The press lets him get away with it. How could a president’s spokespeople say the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi was a protest against a YouTube video, when his own intelligence community believed it likely was a terrorist attack? Answer: The press lets him get away with it. How could a president claim that roads, bridges, and teachers rather than businessmen are responsible for the success of their own companies? You guessed it: The press lets him get away with it. A stunning example of how journalists cover up for this president appeared last week in Glenn Kessler’s Fact Checker column in the Washington Post. Kessler — no relation — gave three pinocchios to an ad from American Crossroads pointing out that President Obama has skipped half of his intelligence briefings. Kessler did not dispute that that was a fact. Indeed, Kessler wrote, during 2011 and the first half of 2012, Obama’s attendance record fell to just over 38 percent. But Kessler went on to offer excuses: Obama could not “skip” a briefing if he had not scheduled one. He reads the President’s Daily Brief. He meets with his national security advisers and asks questions. And some other former presidents also did not attend the briefings. In a conclusion that is entirely beside the point, Kessler wrote, “Ultimately, what matters is what a president does with the information he receives from the CIA.” But since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, what president who cares about the security of the country would risk blowing off the briefings? As noted in my story, "Former CIA Director: Intelligence Briefings Are Valuable," President Bush almost never missed one. “The briefings of Bush were incredibly interactive,” former CIA Director Michael Hayden told me. “There was rich give and take, so that not only did the president get the advantage of knowing the analysts’ innermost thoughts, but they [the analysts] also were able to leave the room understanding what the president believed he needed in order to make the kind of decisions he had to make.” As it happens, the disclosure that Obama has been skipping intelligence briefings 56 percent of the time appeared in a Washington Post column by Marc Thiessen. But any high school paper would have discarded as absurd Glenn Kessler’s supposedly fact-based piece claiming that a truthful ad was false. As in the old Soviet Union, the press propagandizes and distorts reality to favor its hero, President Obama. In the same way, the media ignored for more than a year the fact that Obama spent 20 years listening to the anti-America, anti-white ravings of his self-described mentor and sounding board, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. Thus the mystery of why Obama was elected and remains popular lies squarely with the press’ allegiance to him. While there are exceptions, the media overall downplay the distortions and fail to go on the attack, as reporters did with President Bush. As one example, when Valerie Plame was exposed as a CIA operative, the press turned the disclosure into a scandal and blamed Bush. The New York Times ran 521 stories suggesting it was wrong for the White House and Karl Rove to divulge her name. Only 27 of the articles mentioned the person who actually leaked her name to columnist Robert Novak: former State Department official Richard Armitage, who ironically was a critic of the Bush administration. “A democracy cannot be both ignorant and free,” Thomas Jefferson said. The media’s protection of President Obama represents a shameful chapter in American history.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349117871647</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 14:57:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349118981773-59</Id><Topic><Title>Great Info On MSFT...

Catholics are a key demographic in the upcoming election. In fact, they may be the key demographic. In most every presidential contest since the end of World War II, the candidate who carried the Catholic vote won the election. Over time they have, as a bloc, become more conservative and more Republican in their voting patterns (they were once a major component of the Democrats' presidential coalition) as concerns over settled issues like the morality of abortion overtook in importance concerns about unsettled issues like the best way to secure social justice for the poor and the downtrodden. Much has been made of the fact that both candidates for vice president—Paul Ryan and Joe Biden—are practicing Catholics, though they come at almost every issue from diametrically opposite positions: As one example, Ryan opposes abortion while Biden supports keeping it legal. [See a collection of political cartoons on the Democratic Party.] With most of the national polls showing the race to be one or two points either way, the fight over the Catholic vote is heating up. In Cleveland, Ohio, the local chapter of Right to Life has issued a formal letter to Bishop Richard Lennon asking him to suspend the Diocese's "Faithful Citizenship" meetings because of their disregard for pro-life issues. "As a pro-life woman and a Catholic, I am appalled," Cleveland Right to Life President Molly Smith said in a release. "Our Church is under attack by the most liberal, pro-abortion leadership in history. The Cleveland Catholic Diocese is missing a great teaching and unifying opportunity by responding in this manner." According to Smith's group, "Faithful Citizenship meetings were organized by the Diocese of Cleveland with the goal of aiding Catholics in preparing themselves to vote this November. The forums, led in part by open Obama-supporter Karen Leith, downplay abortion and religious freedom, issues of irreducible importance to Catholic voters." [See a collection of political cartoons on the Catholic contraception controversy.] The push back in Ohio is only part of what is going on nationally said Deal Hudson, the president of the Pennsylvania Catholics Network and an expert on Catholic outreach. "Lay Catholics who are committed to life, marriage, and religious liberty are not going to allow a repeat of the 2008 campaign, when the bishops' document 'Faithful Citizenship' was cherry-picked and spun into a garland of blessing for Barack Obama," Hudson said. "The purpose of the new introduction to the document, published this past November, was to discourage this type of irresponsible partisanship that ignores the Church's teaching on fundamental social issues." [Check out our editorial cartoons on President Obama.] Here is what the administrative committee of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' wrote: Although it has at times been misused to present an incomplete or distorted view of the demands of faith in politics, this statement remains a faithful and challenging call to discipleship in the world of politics. It does not offer a voter's guide, scorecard of issues, or direction on how to vote. It applies Catholic moral principles to a range of important issues and warns against misguided appeals to 'conscience' to ignore fundamental moral claims, to reduce Catholic moral concerns to one or two matters, or to justify choices simply to advance partisan, ideological, or personal interests. "It's the last line from the paragraph above that most directly warns those who twisted the meaning of the bishops' 2007 document," Hudson said. The "Faithful Citizenship" document "outlines and makes important distinctions among moral issues acknowledging that some involve the clear obligation to oppose intrinsic evils which can never be justified and that others require action to pursue justice and promote the common good," rather than simply providing a quantitative listing of issues for equal consideration.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1349139542666</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-01 20:59:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349142249604-88</Id><Topic><Title>Great Info On MSFT...
