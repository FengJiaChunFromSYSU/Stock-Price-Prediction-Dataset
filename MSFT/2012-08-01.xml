Hotmail, which launched in 1996 and which had about 324 million unique visitors in June, is being phased by Microsoft. by J. Jennings Moss, Editor August 1, 2012 | 10:09am EDT If you happen to use a Hotmail account, get ready to send out a change-of-email notice—Microsoft is killing off the email service in favor of a new one that carries the company's Outlook brand. Hotmail, launched in 1996, is one of the oldest email services around and it helped pioneer the model of largely free email for anyone who wanted it. It's held up to competition from Google, Yahoo and Apple, but just hasn't evolved that much over the years. Hence the switch to Outlook, which Microsoft officials announced Tuesday is more than just a name change to align it to is suite of Office products, but incorporates real changes designed to help users manage their communications. Here's how the Wall Street Journal is describing the changes: Perhaps the most visible change in Outlook.com is a simpler design compared with Hotmail. Among new features, Outlook.com can automatically isolate newsletters or other "junk" email that falls between urgent mail and spam. Outlook.com also has a unified address book that contains contact information for people on Outlook.com, Gmail, Facebook, LinkedIn and other services. Outlook.com users can see recent status updates from Facebook, or Twitter posts when they open emails from a contact already in their address book, Microsoft said. In the future, Microsoft intends to add Skype voice and video calling as well, , but no date has been set to begin that feature, Mr. [Brian Hall, general manager of Windows] said. The new service began in a trial way for U.S. users on Tuesday, though Microsoft expects to replace all Hotmail.com addresses globally with ones from Outlook.com. According to comScore, Hotmail had 324 million unique visitors world-wide in June while Gmail had about 278 million unique visitors in the same month.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343831671000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 10:34:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343831967000-14</Id><Topic><Title>Conservatives are on their last leg in denying MMGW</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1343740045000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 09:07:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are associating the whole "right" with the religious, many of whom happen to lean right.

Borrowing from SS and other governmentsl agencies is a cash flow surplus, but involves spending money that would be classified "unearned revenue" in a private business. If a private business reported that as income the officers would be put in jail for fraud. ---------- That is the real fraud. Both the general fund and entitlement funds receive money from the same taxpayers. Those who tout the surplus can't explain why the national debt went up each year. If it truly was a surplus the national debt would have declined. With a combined budget, general fund plus entitlements there has only been 1 year of surplus since inception of SS during the Eisenhower administration.</Msg><Username>infactidoknowitall</Username><Timestamp>1343832664000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 10:51:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343832836000-18</Id><Title>MSFT getting ready for NEW HIGHS</Title><Msg>:Enjoy http://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1343832836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 10:53:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343833265000-19</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8 , How big?</Title><Username>obadidoss</Username><Timestamp>1343797401000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 01:03:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;Oh, I'm sure the PC OEMs will bend over, as they must do for the abusive monopolist every few years, and load W8 on new PCs.

And more specifically, as pointed out in an article I posted the oher day, most large companies (who are Microsoft's core market) will be very reluctant to adopt it until forced to do so, because they are still clinging to XP, because that lets them stick with IE6, because they have allowed themselves to be locked into IE6's nonstandard misfeatures and bugs.

Correlation does NOT prove causation but causation can only come from correlation... &gt; Some years ago, I gave serious thought to the question of whether the concept of "cause" could even be defined on the basis of the "laws" of physics. I concluded, tentatively, that it could not be, except perhaps in somewhat the same way that one defines a "limit" in mathematics. It appears that "cause" is essentially a legal concept, to be applied in the course of litigation for the purpose of assigning *blame*. Legal proceedings give the appearance of precision, or at least carefulness, but it's nothing like the precision one encounters in physics, having its basis in mathematics.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343850055000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 15:40:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343850231000-61</Id><Topic><Title>Dubya Said There Was Clinton Surplus</Title><Username>captain_snotty</Username><Timestamp>1343788466000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-07-31 22:34:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Couldn't overcome Barney Frank in 2003 or 2005, certainly was not going to overcome Barney Frank when the democrats had the majority in the senate.
