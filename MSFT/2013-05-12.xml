LOL like Microsoft has been protecting the Windows user all these years? The problem with an endless stream of security patches is that it's endless, immediately implying that there are a boundless set of flaws yet to be fixed, requiring boundless time to get around to them, even once discovered and reported. As a Windows user you are guaranteed that after every Patch Tuesday you have a full month of vulnerabiliy to suffer and chew your nails through until the next Patch Tuesday.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1368363249584</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 08:54:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368364662226-17</Id><Title>Now Pete Rose Is Helping Microsoft Scare People Away From Google Apps</Title><Msg>Google it.

BTW Every one of them who use the term "Faux", like the idiots they are not knowing the x is silent in Faux, is a brainless Obama tool. The IRS fiasco is the reason smart people want smaller government. Government collects money to give government power to abuse and target "enemies". There are already too many laws used to target those with whom government powers that be disagree, it's why the 2nd Amendment is becoming more needed by the day as a deterrent.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368395100213</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 17:45:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368395216182-83</Id><Topic><Title>Oppo buffa flooding the board...</Title><Username>gudonov</Username><Timestamp>1368381255796</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 13:54:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Google "oppo buffa" ....

The post are to illustrate that a City is always going to go for a switch and bait ploy to save several hundred thousand they can spend on expensive dinners and trips. The point is Google low balls Microsoft bids and then pulls a switch and bait. When they want to do something they used to do for no extra cost from Microsoft, Google says there will be an extra charge for that. So it is a switch and bait low ball predator tactic and by a company that is putting the entire USA security at jeopardy. Not maybe putting the Countries security in jeopardy, 100% definitely absolutely positively they are. When the FBI says it, you may want to make some changes regarding that Linux hippie shet. I was just with someone in Washington, DC that has high security clearance and is a IT contractor for an agency I cannot mention. He wiped out an Andriod when I asked him to check on a medicine my Mother was taking. My phone was out in my car because I was cutting the grass. He pulls out an Andriod. I said don't you have high level security clearance and you know about the Android and all the problems with Malware, spying etc. He said yea I guess. No other comment and could not care less. So I have said it before, people do not care if their identities are being browsed through and all the malware scares. Something bad needs to happen to them personally or they ignore it. That is how Google continues, they know their systems are completely and totally unsafe and they know the average person is too busy to care until they are an actual victim.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1368403983881</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 20:13:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368405493033-98</Id><Title>Afghanistan: US Troops pack up and head out.

It has only been since last October and you have the contract system with mobile. It does not happen in 1 week. You have people judging if phone sales are this and that the first day. That is fools at their finest. You have to consider that people have contracts and have to wait for upgrade eligibility with most carriers. TMobile is changing that . However, Verizon &amp; ATT are very are rough and no one wants to pay $600.00 or $900.00 for a phone that is off contract. That makes results in mobile slow.

The authors behind the malicious code apparently disguised their hoax under the guise of font-installing apps. Offering an application that claims to legitimately download more content can bypass Google Play's security systems and spread malicious code. Security firm Webroot identified the threat as "Android.TechnoReaper" and points out that it's quite cleverly disguised. The app doesn't seem too popular, but the risk exists. "Once you install the app, it looks like a nice app used to install new fonts on your phone," notes the security firm. "Everything looks legitimate, but if you look in the code you'll see you could get more than you bargained for." The malicious apps found on Google Play download spyware called iKno Android Spy. It remains unclear whether iKno Android Spy actually does everything it claims to do or whether it also sends the data to a third party as well. If another app is downloading it, for instance, uses no longer have control over what iKno is doing.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368408265577</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-05-12 21:24:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368408299802-104</Id><Topic><Title>Afghanistan: US Troops pack up and head out.
