Guess what the new language XAML is almost exactly like Silverlight. I am still mad over the Silverlight issue but life goes on. Anyone that learned Silverlight is years ahead of the pack in using XAML. We use the exact same software Expression Blend &amp; Visual Studio and it looks the same with just new namespaces and learning what is allowed and not allowed. All developers get in hissy fits because they get so used to a programming language and a new version comes out. I personally believe that XAML is a revised version of Silverlight to escape antitrust issues if Silverlight would have been used. Any Silverlight Programmer can write code in a few days in XAML which is one of the programming languages for Windows 8. You can also write apps in html/java for Windows 8. LIFE GOES ON AFTER SILVERLIGHT. I still use it all over the web and it runs on the desktop version of Windows 8.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1369288593530</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 01:56:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369290488528-3</Id><Title>xbox One: msft, aapl: iphone</Title><Msg>get in while it is cheap.

Obama told us himself when asked about it in a 2009 forum on ABC: Member of the audience, Jane Sturm: “My mother is now over 105. But at 100, the doctors said to her, ‘I can’t do anything more unless you have a pacemaker.’ I said, ‘Go for it.’ She said, ‘Go for it.’ When the specialist saw her and saw her joy of life, he said, ‘I’m going for it.’ That was over five years ago. My question to you is: Outside the medical criteria for prolonging life for somebody who is elderly, is there any consideration that can be given for a certain spirit, a certain joy of living, a quality of life, or is it just a medical cutoff at a certain age?” Obama's hesitant, stammering answer: “I don’t think that we can make judgments based on people’s ‘spirit.’ Uh, that would be, uh, a pretty subjective decision to be making. I think we have to have rules that, uh, say that, uh, we are going to provide good quality care for all people. End-of-life care is one of the most difficult sets of decisions that we’re going to have to make. At least we can let doctors know — and your mom know — that you know what, maybe this isn’t going to help. Maybe you’re better off, uhh, not having the surgery, but, uhh, taking the painkiller.” "End-of-life care is one of the most difficult sets of decisions that we’re going to have to make." "Difficult" decisions that "we're" going to be making. The "we" in "we're" as defined in Obamacare is a review panel in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, with ultimate decision making in the hands of the Secretary of HHS. THEY ALONE will decide when it is "sensible" to provide further care OR NOT. That is absolutely, by definition a death panel, and if you still deny it, you are an irrecoverable, pathological, kool-aid slurping, dumb-bass leftist kook.</Msg><Username>plmartin02</Username><Timestamp>1369318653280</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 10:17:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1369318885608-37</Id><Title>Hey ossobucco (AKA Meathead)</Title><Msg>I thought this was supposed to be $45 by now? $75 by July!!! $100 by Labor Day!!

Cruz has always been squeaky clean, a fighter for truth, justice and the American Way, Captain America. Good luck with all that. Connections to Tea Party? Americans for Prosperity? Freedomworks? You must be joking. These are the groups that are helping to expose the corruption and the big lie of the left so effectively to the low information voter base in America. That's why the Regime of Darkness is so aggressively focused like a laser on them and not run-of-the-mill, play-ball RINO Republicans. The DHS tries to brand them as some kind of a physical threat. The IRS discriminates, delays and denies them. The DOJ abuses them and shakes them down. These groups are setting up the future of nationalizing elections, shifting the debate to the core issue: liberalism vs. Americanism.

Just xbox one alone will do that for msft: Kinect has so many applications, body motion gaming-- if you are not a kid or below 40, you probably don't understand how important this is. Imagine to be able to control sport games with body motions (skiing, skating, and many other sports). Fighting games will be spectacular, imagine two kids going at it with street fighters-- kicking bashing each other, using their avatars on big screen. The avatars are mimicking every motion of the players. Just to see my avatars moving and mimicking my motions alone, I will pay $500 easily, even the games suck!!! So as everyone else; everyone on the planet is self loving and love having their body motion and movements mimicked. This is the newest innovation in technology. Get in now! Kinect motion doesn't just end with games; it will allow you to control your media center with hand gestures and voice commands. Incomes don't just end with games; you are looking at movies, music, TV, cables, internet.</Msg><Username>microsoftd1ck</Username><Timestamp>1369332631015</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 14:10:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369332825363-111</Id><Topic><Title>if msft does not reach $50/sh by xmas, I will quit investing forever</Title><Username>microsoftd1ck</Username><Timestamp>1369325098639</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 12:04:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BTW , apple TV only ecompasses a fraction of what the Xbox has to offer.

Intel is producing a new generation of chips that will be unique. Intel CEO said other companies won't be able to figure out how to make 3D FinFET architecture as Intel has done, and so far he has been correct. The new tablet/Haswell chip is coming in June, and with regular and significant improvements every few months for 18-24 months after that. Phenomenal 4G LTE phone chips in early 2014. The new chips will help MSFT, especially if Apple decides to not use them, and what Apple will do is the subject of great speculation. There's little corresponding speculation about MSFT - they'll be all over the new Intel chips. Intel has spent literally billions ramping up production capacity the last two years to be able to make these new chips in large volumes. Better performance, lower power usage, cheaper to make. Profit margins will be very nice. Intel is cheap now. Did you miss the rise in MSFT? There's time left on Intel.

SO Heather Bellini has a BUY rating on CRM (she issued it on May 8/2013) which has annual revenue of around $3 billion and projected EPS of 50 cents for the next FY.... SO Heather Bellini has PT of $55 for CRM which makes it a P/E multiple of 110.... NOW here is the catch, MSFT is going to eat CRM alive with its Cloud Azure business and all this nonsense about Mr. Softy and Windows-8 is just a distraction from the real issue.... MY guess is GS has their own money and a lot of clients money tied up in a company that should be trading around $12.50 with a P/E multiple of 25 and NOT 110 while their growth is getting crushed by us and will be trading around $5.00 soon.

I have been right on the mark about Obama. A great man, great President. Without a doubt the best one since Abraham Lincoln in my book. Remarkably clear speech he made today, historical, insightful, a real leader of our free nation. He is not caught, exposed, or done. He hasn't done anything to be caught, is not in hiding, and is elected into his second term, not done.

Those voice commands work well. The thing that investors are missing that are not developing for the XBOX One is the most common activity of the box will require either a Windows phone or Windows tablet. 99% of people will be watching tv or a movie and want to go to the split screen to check their email, have their facebook up or twitter. You have to use the input device of a phone or tablet if there is audio from the tv. You cannot do voice commands over a loud tv. That is a killer feature. There are many people that live and die to get a new tweet or Facebook message the instant it comes in. They can have apps running in the corner of their tv while watching their favorite shows. The Nokia Lumia phones have the Xbox app and glass already installed. I would definitely say a Nokia Lumia is a must have if you buy the xbox.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1369367868414</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 23:57:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
