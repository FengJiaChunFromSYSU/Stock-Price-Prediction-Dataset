Tizen was originally planned as a open source OS by another US company, Intel to get into the device business and it was a mistake to team up with Samsung as they compete in Chip space and the record shows that Samsung is not a trustworthy partner and that Intel is beginning to get cold feet as they realize open systems on Internet are bad moves and the OS needs to be in a closed environment. IT is also funny the name Samsung chose for their Android anti-malware potion as the real Fort ought to be the OS and NOT something that sits on top of it as they seem confused and desperate for a miracle that won't be coming.

But when Donna Aydelott, treasurer of the group's Denver chapter, applied for tax-exempt status in March 2011, the Internal Revenue Service's Cincinnati office didn't get back to her until the following January — and it had a lengthy list of questions and demands for paperwork. The questions, which the U.S. Inspector General has called chilling and onerous in nature, included asking Aydelott to "list persons or entities with which you maintain a close relationship, including but not exclusively public officials, candidates for public offices, political parties ..." Aydelott, who said the situation was like "David and Goliath," did as she was asked. On her lunch hours and after work, she made copies of the organization's activities and composed 70 pages of response to the IRS. Her organization eventually was approved. Coalition for a Conservative Majority is among at least four Colorado groups that were improperly scrutinized or had applications that were purposefully delayed by the IRS in the two years the agency was found to be targeting conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status, according to the Inspector General.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1368798131999</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 09:42:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368798166991-35</Id><Title>dang...2 days ago the may 34 calls were $0.05</Title><Msg>that would have been a tasty 500% profit...</Msg><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1368798166991</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 09:42:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368798301218-36</Id><Title>MSFT: might see 35.01$ today: 40$ next few weeks target 50$ next year</Title><Msg>==================== eom ============================================</Msg><Username>ngmike18</Username><Timestamp>1368798301218</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 09:45:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368798350994-37</Id><Topic><Title>ValueAct: Microsoft Could Potentially Become The World’s Largest Company....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368453132061</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-13 09:52:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here we go, run by the richest man in the world and owned by the richest shareholders in the world....

Several factors have contributed to the company's sharp share gains, such as the growth and excitement in Microsoft's videogame business, the market's strong run, the company's stable cash flow, and its 2.7% dividend yield and regular stock buyback program, both popular with value investors. Yet beneath those trends, its enterprise software business--where Microsoft earns 70% of revenue and nearly 90% of operating profit--is undergoing a revival online. As the largest maker of PC software, Microsoft has turned to the Web, especially for businesses, as the way to leverage its $70 billion software franchise into the so-called cloud computing era. Of the current 600 million users of office-productivity software, 90% use Microsoft products, according to Gartner.

Acting IRS Commissioner Steven Miller told lawmakers during a Capitol Hill hearing that the question-and-answer session that exposed the tax agency's targeting of conservative groups for extra scrutiny had been carefully planned. "It was a prepared Q and A," Miller said when asked about IRS official Lois Lerner's response to a question from a lobbyist at an American Bar Association conference last week. When pressed whether the question was planted in advance, Miller said, "I believe that we talked about that, yes." Miller did not elaborate on why the IRS chose such a strategy to reveal what has become a scandal over whether the tax agency treated some conservative groups fairly.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1368804569940</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 11:29:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368805069742-68</Id><Topic><Title>science has proven that conservative thinking is low energy thinking ( easy emotional )</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1368737036566</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-16 16:43:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's right is the easy path, takes less energy, easy less emotion.

That is not what made America great, Moe.</Msg><Username>misterreality14</Username><Timestamp>1368810471107</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:07:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368810513117-100</Id><Title>STEC just qualified</Title><Msg>Buy?</Msg><Username>investor.individual</Username><Timestamp>1368810513117</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:08:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368810526374-101</Id><Topic><Title>Windoze Phone is a total dud.</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366334198327</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 21:16:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reminder time.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368810526374</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:08:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368810547184-102</Id><Topic><Title>Google says it has 900 million Android activations, launches new Android API to improve apps</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368646911121</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:41:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reminder again</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368810547184</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:09:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368810584227-103</Id><Topic><Title>Google: more than 48 billion Android application installs, and 2.5 billion in the last four months alone</Title><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368647184107</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 15:46:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another reminder</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368810584227</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:09:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368811436958-104</Id><Topic><Title>microsoft making great products now that everyone is standing in line for</Title><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1368808256105</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 12:30:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great diverse line of products coming on as MSFT catapults twoards $40+</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1368811436958</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:23:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368811636450-105</Id><Topic><Title>Personalized Learning Initiative with Microsoft, Dell and Intel....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368807555798</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 12:19:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The wonton shill is in denial as proven by his ever desperate frequent cry baby posts.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1368811636450</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:27:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368811676436-106</Id><Title>Dell discounting Windows RT tablets to $299</Title><Msg>I'd consider buying one, if it came with Ubuntu Linux instead.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1368811676436</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:27:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368811782922-107</Id><Topic><Title>Dell discounting Windows RT tablets to $299</Title><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1368811676436</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:27:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I wouldn't use ubango to run a cheap card game.MSFT doesn't need any stinking penguins.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1368811782922</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:29:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368812044072-108</Id><Title>my hed dizzeeee bought 12-17-12 26.60</Title><Msg>you cant ask for any more -38-40 nov.</Msg><Username>raggwead</Username><Timestamp>1368812044072</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 13:34:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368813083317-109</Id><Title>SEE huge sell-off too far too fast</Title><Msg>Same old greed games here.

Network World - Windows 8 faces an uphill battle to become a standard corporate operating system because many businesses are in the midst of or have recently completed the move from Windows XP to Windows 7 and don't have the stomach for another transition anytime soon. That’s the bottom line from a Forrester Research report that also says businesses need to prepare for a grassroots push from employees who want to use the operating system for work. The report “IT will skip Windows 8 as the enterprise standard” says that 48% of commercial PCs run Windows 7, and 76% say they are deploying new PCs running Windows 7. These figures are based on a survey of 1,282 PC decision-makers in North America and Europe last fall. Projecting ahead to this fall 26% of that group say new PCs issued by their companies will run Windows 8. Last fall 46% of those surveyed hadn’t looked at Windows 8 and 4% had plans to deploy by this fall, the report says, and 24% said their organizations had no specific plans for Windows 8 deployment although they expected to at some point. “IT decision-makers see Windows 8 as a significant change from Windows 7, but not yet a positive one from the enterprise IT perspective,” according to the report.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368817223186</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:00:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368817552862-128</Id><Topic><Title>Next up - Margin calls for MSFT shorts....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368565641793</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 17:07:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here we go!

Right now the indisputable fact is we are borrowing more than we are growing GDP, which means the GDP growth is not real. In 1999 they said earnings didn't matter for dot.coms and for a long while that appeared right, but ultimately fundamentals rule.

I would agree with your take, but the "breakout" happened with no volume and is clearly manipulated to paint a breakout. I have seen individual stoks trade like this market for as long as I have been watching, never the whole market, that takes collusion, that takes coordination and playing the bot programming. I do think a bull is in the works but this run has no technical basis, little fundamental basis, and no volume to declare it real. Soon there will be no excuse for QE (actually if you believe the Liar in Chief that time was 2 years ago, and we're still printing $4MM a day)</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1368821973745</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 16:19:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368822076888-171</Id><Topic><Title>The shorts are pinning their hopes on a market correction, but....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1368819691738</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 15:41:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>DO you know what the market would be like with Republicans in office?

Analysis Those who upgraded to Windows 8 aren't the only ones unhappy with the new touch-driven operating system - Wall Street is too. Just don't expect any of the criticism hurled at Steve "Teflon" Ballmer, Microsoft's shy and retiring boss, to stick. The chief executive is under fire from money men who responded to tech reporters trolling the markets for blistering opinions on Microsoft's leadership, given that: PC sales are crashing; Windows Phone 8 smartmobes are in fourth place in the US mobile OS market; and Windows 8 Surface gadgets are barely on the worldwide tablet sales charts. The new touchscreen-friendly Windows has not been that well received, resulting the software giant undoing decisions made at the highest levels. "Certainly investors think Ballmer's the wrong guy," Ed Maguire, an analyst at investment biz CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, told The Telegraph. "You could make the argument that he missed tablets and he missed smartphones, and that these are the two areas of technology that really count."</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1368829480157</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-17 18:24:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368830488738-188</Id><Topic><Title>Hey, Teflon Ballmer.

Quoting: ' With Windows 8, Microsoft started focusing on smartphones and tablets and pushed developers to use the "Modern" API to build apps for these devices. At the same time, Microsoft effectively killed off Silverlight and XNA, two popular programming languages that developers had spent years learning, and which can be used to build mobile apps. 'Ziliang Guo, a third party Windows developer, told Business Insider that Microsoft alienated many developers with this decision. He believes this could cause long term damage to Microsoft's mobile ambitions. ' "Losing entire communities of developers like they did with XNA is going to have long term strategic implications," Guo said Thursday in an email. "Those were the people most likely to have been able to make the Microsoft app store a success by providing quality applications and games." 'In a blog post earlier this month about Microsoft's missteps, Guo put it more bluntly. 'When Microsoft began focusing on mobile devices with Windows 8, it " systematically #$%$ off significant portions of their existing developer base, either by deprecating the platforms they relied on, treating them disrespectfully, or by outright trying to force them to write phone/tablet applications by imposing restrictions," Guo wrote.

You see the most interesting thing in the past several days was that the shorts tried to manipulate before and after hours trades, they even committed fraud and were caught by NASDAQ, and we closed at or near the day's high, with today the last trade was the highest in over 5 years.... I make a point of looking at the trades of the last minute before the close, when the big traders buy/sell 10% of the daily volume, and the tape goes absolutely wild.... In short, no pun intended, the shorts are stressed out while the longs feel confident, are hanging on and are adding on the dips.... There is also no question that MSFT has some chronic naysayers/shorts, and for whatever reason they fail to read the current dynamics correctly and my sense is that they will be shaken out next week as Xbox-720 and T-Mobile shows get underway as we may see a couple of days of 100 million plus trades to set a new trading range over $40.00 till further developments.

It is frightening that we have a president who has such contempt for precious human life. Older conservatives are also at risk because Obamacare Death Panels will likely soon begin nudging elderly people out of their hospital beds and into the hereafter.
