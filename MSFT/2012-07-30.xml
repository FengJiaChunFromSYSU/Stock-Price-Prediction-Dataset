The rumor mill has again started rolling and this time it has to do with the much talked about Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Surface tablet computers. It seems Surface will carry a price tag much higher than what was being expected and what is already prevailing in the market. If this is the case, what lies ahead for Microsoft? And how high a price are we talking about? Let’s dig deeper. It’s a mad, mad price! Webhallen.com, a Swedish website, listed prices for the four variants of the Surface tablet computers and it seems the cheapest Surface will cost something around $1,000. You read it right -- $1,000. To this, all I can say is this is madness!</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343659689000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:48:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343660229000-15</Id><Topic><Title>Surface to Cost More than iPad, Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire Combined?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343659689000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:48:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Motley Fool -one of the most vicious anti Microsoft sh.trag propaganda pieces on the planet Nobody in this business gives them a dimes worth of credibility BTW you have to make a choice wotopimp- either Microsoft is going to drive their erstwhile partners out of the tablet business with competing devices or they are not- kind of looks like not considering that HP, Dell etc will be abel to beat the price of the surface by quite a bit - so either they build the boxes or Microsoft will build them and they can cut their price pretty fast when they see which way the wind is blowing Woto- stick with pimping- in the flesh trade -not IT</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1343660229000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:57:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343660737000-16</Id><Topic><Title>Surface to Cost More than iPad, Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire Combined?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343659689000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:48:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;Motley Fool -one of the most vicious anti Microsoft sh.trag propaganda pieces on the planet&gt; That's what you say about EVERY publication, stupid idiot/bot.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343660737000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 11:05:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343661161000-17</Id><Topic><Title>Surface to Cost More than iPad, Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire Combined?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343659689000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:48:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;&gt;That's what you say about EVERY publication, stupid idiot/bot. thats what I say about every vicious propaganda sh.trag that bashes Microsoft stupid idiot/bot</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1343661161000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 11:12:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343661482000-18</Id><Topic><Title>Surface to Cost More than iPad, Nexus 7 and Kindle Fire Combined?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343659689000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 10:48:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You removed an important piece of information from the Motley Fool article: However, keep in mind that the tablet might not cost the same in the U.S. Since the standard of living in Sweden is pretty high, gadgets automatically cost more over there.

I can't resist pointing out the logical implication: For 80% of companies, it would be no harder to migrate to Linux than to migrate to Windows 8. http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/07/30/why-windows-8-wont-matter-for-many-large-companies/?partner=yahootix Tim Worstall, Contributor I write about business and technology. Follow (177) Tech | 7/30/2012 @ 12:32PM |928 views Why Windows 8 Won't Matter For Many Large Companies I have to admit this rather surprised me but it does seem that the upcoming Windows 8 just isn’t going to be an issue at all for many large users. This includes private sector companies as well as public sector users over in the UK. The reason being that many of them haven’t made it to Windows Vista yet, let alone 7, and so just aren’t in the upgrade path leading to Windows 8. Windows 7 is running in just 20 per cent of large enterprises with the most difficult migrations yet to come. That’s according to web browser specialist Browsium, which said 80 per cent of big companies – those with 10,000 or more PCs – are still clinging to Windows XP even though support for it is due to end in two years. But IT department bosses fear the cost, difficulty and disruption of moving business-critical apps from Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 6 and 7, which are off-limits on Windows 7. The reason for this is more than just a little delicious. Back in the days of Windows XP there was a great deal of effort made to encourage software written to perform in Internet Explorer. Apps and so on. Many companies did exactly this and wrote their basic systems within this environment. The encouragement came from Microsoft of course as it locked those users into the entire Windows experience. For apps written to take advantage of the ways and times in which Explorer deviated from the standards were apps that would not be easily portable to other browsers. And if they can’t go to other browsers then clearly not to other operating systems underneath. But now that Microsoft is releasing operating systems that do not support IE 6 and 7, and most certainly do not support those off standard things which the apps are using, this is stopping users from migrating their OS up the series as Microsoft would like them to. For it would actually require entire system rewrites to do so. And as many companies are quite rightly concluding, if you’ve got a system that works then why on earth would you want to do that? I find this amusing myself: Microsoft’s efforts a decade ago to make sure that people did not leave Microsoft have led to the company now losing two and possibly three sets of upgrade fees as a result.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343675376000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:09:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343676063000-28</Id><Topic><Title>Why Windows 8 Won't Matter For Many Large Companies</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343675376000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:09:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What's really tragic is how you coninue to shill linux on the MSFT board which nobody in their right mind wants LOL!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1343676063000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343678264000-29</Id><Topic><Title>Why Windows 8 Won't Matter For Many Large Companies</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343675376000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 15:09:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;What's really tragic is how you coninue to shill linux on the MSFT board which nobody in their right mind wants&gt; You're learning the wallybot art of embedding multiple lies in one short sentence.

According to The Verge, information on the new devices came from court documents that were submitted as part of the ongoing battle between Apple and Samsung. The first phone, currently referred to as the "Odyssey," comes with a dual-core 1.5GHz processor from Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), and is apparently described as an "iconic smartphone" with 4G LTE. (How can something be iconic before it is even released?) Odyssey will also feature a 4.65-inch Super AMOLED display (high-def, of course), as well as an 8MP rear camera. According to The Verge, the device may also support the Wallet Hub and Tap + Send features of Windows Phone 8. Samsung's other device, currently referred to as "Marco," will reportedly feature a four-inch Super AMOLED display, and will also support 4G LTE. While this unofficial announcement is good news for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), which no longer has to rely on Nokia (NYSE: NOK) to save its Windows Phone 8 platform, it could greatly impact the company's relationship with Google. Samsung may not have any plans to drop Android. The company may fully intend to release the Galaxy S IV exclusively on Android next year. But if its Windows Phone 8 experiment proves to be successful, Samsung will have to make a choice when it comes time to develop its best next-gen phones. The company will not be able to make all of them for Android. Thus, Android may end up missing out on phones that it could have had if Samsung had avoided Windows Phone 8 development. But the consequences will not end there. By developing for the Windows Phone 8 platform, Samsung has given an official thumbs-up to Microsoft's latest mobile OS. In doing so, other smartphone manufacturers are bound to take notice. When that happens, Android could continue to lose. Just as the market shifted to Android from other platforms, it could soon shift from Android to Windows Phone 8. For now, however, Android can celebrate the fact that its Samsung-manufactured devices have outsold the iPhone by more than 20 million units. Apple is having a bit of a celebration as well. Earlier this month, ChangeWave Research revealed that iPhone 5 demand is through the roof, breaking all records set by the previous iPhones, including the iPhone 4S. .

Judge Andreas Voss ordered Motorola to pay half the costs. Don’t Miss: Apple and Google Can’t Stop Fighting. The Mannheim Regional Court also granted Microsoft an injunction against Motorola devices, including its Razr, Razr Maxx, and Atrix smartphones. If enforced by Microsoft, the injunction will require Motorola to recall all infringing products from sale in that country. The Windows maker has already enforced an injunction against Motorola in Germany based on an earlier win related to an SMS messaging patent. “We will continue to enforce injunctions against Motorola Mobility products in [the U.S. and Germany] and hope they will join other Android device makers by taking a license to Microsoft’s patented inventions,” Microsoft corporate vice president David Howard said. Motorola said it was not immediately anticipating an impact on operations and added that it will explore appeal options, according to the Wall Street Journal. Microsoft has also enforced an injunction against the Google unit in the U.S. after the U.S. International Trade Commission granted it the right to do in a case related to a technology that syncs entries in software features. According to Florian Mueller of FOSS patents, Motorola is the only major Android device maker that has not taken a patent license from Microsoft. Mueller says more than 70 percent of Android devices sold in the U.S., including those of HTC and Samsung, have a license from Microsoft.

FAT is a file system that has been in place for years. Microsoft used the FAT standard in a host of its operating systems, including DOS and several Windows versions. The company argues that Motorola violates its FAT patent in the file system it employs in its Android version. Luckily for Motorola, however, Linux has several file systems, so the company could switch to those.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343697805000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-07-30 21:23:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343699064000-41</Id><Title>Abraham Lincoln wisely said, "It's better</Title><Msg>to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubts".
