Ryan, the Republican vice presidential nominee, has proposed transforming Medicare into a “premium support” system in which beneficiaries get a fixed payment from the government for their health insurance, instead of guaranteed benefits. Such a plan would lead to wide variations in the cost of Medicare across the country, according to the Kaiser study reported today. Fifty-nine percent of Medicare beneficiaries would have paid more in 2010, unless they switched from traditional Medicare or their current private coverage to a lower-cost plan, the researchers found. In California, Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Nevada and New York, it would cost more than $100 extra a month to maintain traditional coverage for Medicare.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1350317093401</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 12:04:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350317664046-41</Id><Topic><Title>Game changing report - MSFT</Title><Username>lydiakon13288</Username><Timestamp>1350310401327</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 10:13:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice one, I will subscribe now.</Msg><Username>ledajpguc022900</Username><Timestamp>1350317664046</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 12:14:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350318349833-42</Id><Topic><Title>Medicare Premiums Would Rise for 59% With Ryan Plan</Title><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1350317093401</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 12:04:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" paid more in 2010 ' why you lie ???

Century Mine said they want President Barack Obama to stop what they term the war on coal - and to stop spreading mistruths about them. Miners gathered Friday afternoon to express their opposition to Obamas energy and environmental policies, which they believe threaten their jobs. Miner Mitch Miracle read aloud a letter the miners mailed to Obama that outlines some of their concerns. The miners said Obamas campaign team is running ads filled with blatantly false statements about the miners regarding their participation in Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romneys August campaign stop at the Century Mine. These ads assert that the miners were forced to attend the event by the mines owner, Robert Murray. Article Photos Casey Junkins STANDING UP FOR COAL — Mitch Miracle, a coal miner at American Energy Corp. Century Mine near Beallsville, speaks out Friday against what he and his fellow miners call President Barack Obama’s war on coal. There are numerous false statements and absolute lies concerning our participation in this event, mostly started by a local shock jock radio host, the miners letter to Obama states. Why would you (Obama) lie about the 500 working miners who have signed this letter? We, the employees of the Century Mine would request you immediately stop these false ads. This summer, Murray Energy Corp., parent company of the Beallsville mine, cut or relocated 56 workers with the closure of the Red Bird West mine near Brilliant. Murray also cut 29 mining jobs from The Ohio Valley Coal Co.s Powhatan No. 6 Mine. All of this was done, Robert Murray said, because of Obamas war on coal. Murray then hosted the August Romney campaign stop in Beallsville, during which many miners appeared behind Romney as the former Massachusetts governor spoke about the need to protect coal mining jobs. In response to the assertion some have made about the miners being forced to appear with Romney, the miners made the following points on Friday: As for anyone who claims the miners were forced to attend, those on-site Friday said these assertions probably came from discharged or disgruntled former employees. Despite the miners Friday statements, Ohio Democrats have requested a federal investigation regarding Murrays campaign contributions and practices.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1350353679669</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:14:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350354530436-141</Id><Topic><Title>Obamanure done on Tuesday!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1350352944700</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:02:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Smells like Obamanurist!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1350354530436</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:28:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350354971374-142</Id><Title>All you hear on talk shows from people like Gretta Van Sustern and others is</Title><Msg>..... them asking their guests like Rudi Juliliani, "Why did Obamma do that" or "Why did he do this" or "What was he thinking" because they're in disbelief and don't understand what the dim witted dolt Kenyan is doing.

The federal suit came on the heels a campaign request to the state’s Government Accountability Board to extend the deadline after at least 30 Wisconsin municipalities failed to send overseas ballots 45 days before the election, which is required under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voter Act (UOCAVA). The campaign proceeded with the suit against GAB after their initial request was denied. “Because members of the military are often stationed in remote, dangerous, frontline locations, there is a substantial likelihood that the defendants’ violations of law will prevent military voters from receiving, completing, and returning their ballots in time to have them counted,” the lawsuit filed Friday reads. “The defendants’ unlawful conduct therefore may effectively disenfranchise the very men and women who make daily sacrifices to protect our system of democratic government.”</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1350356324852</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:58:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350357023172-165</Id><Title>Hillary is going to take the blame?? WHY?</Title><Msg>Someone, maybe MORE THAN ONE someones, of your stature needs to take action. Not you so called husband. He just stood up at a Democrat Party National Convention and told the nation that no one "not even me" could have done anything about the economy as it stood in 2008. LIE. Then he stated that the Obama administrations "plans" for the next four years are somehow comparable to what was done during HIS administration. Only in the sense of "They are doing almost exactly the opposite of what we did". Why would he say the opposite? YOU were married to him and YOU KNOW the answer. Sorry, I just STUDIED the personality type for 6 years, but we BOTH know the answer: Because he would SAY ANYTHING. Whatever is convenient at the time. OK, as far as THAT goes, yes, he and President have some things in common, BUT.... As far as ECONOMIC POLICY? HA HA. There is another reason, you know. He, Bill Clinton, NEVER wants to see you become President. You just took care of that one, Hillary. WHY?? Remember when you started? College? Those first campaigns? Gonna change the world?? Change it into THIS, Hillary? Don't you remember the most IMPORTANT THING?? Your life having a PURPOSE? Serving the People of America?? The COUNTRY?? The WORLD. Whatever else you are, I know something about you. Remember my field of study. YOU, Hillary, are NOT a sociopath. You may be a politician, but you DO have the ability to consider the feelings and the worth of people besides yourself. Here's comes the tough part of that. Falling on your sword to save the political career of Barrack Obama is NOT "the right thing to do." You know that "the right thing to do" is NOT referring to "the most effective politically". It means the moral thing, the action that fulfills your OATH to serve, to protect the Constition of the USA. It is going to take someone like you, maybe even TWO or THREE people at your level to look in the mirror and say "NO. NO. NO, I will NOT lie and cheat and destroy the country I love to serve the ambitions of a man who plays Angry Birds, or listens to rap or God only knows what on his I-Pad while the daily security assessment PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND or sometimes just records silently. In case there's something important on it. That way he can check it later. It has to stop now. YOU can make it stop. YOU, like Winston Churchill, Abraham Lincoln, FDR, Queen Elizabeth I and only very very few other people in the history of the world...YOU can SAVE your COUNTRY. The Times make the man, or the woman, but only if she stands up to them. May God give you the strength.</Msg><Username>asu_eht_evol_i</Username><Timestamp>1350357023172</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:10:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350357585841-166</Id><Topic><Title>Romney doesn't want to get rid of Big Bird</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350356082455</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:54:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yep and the Kenyan is, WORTHLESS.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350357585841</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:19:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350357843133-167</Id><Topic><Title>Obamanure done on Tuesday!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1350352944700</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:02:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At least all the troops have federal IDs!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1350357843133</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 23:24:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350357880519-168</Id><Topic><Title>All you hear on talk shows from people like Gretta Van Sustern and others is</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1350354971374</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:36:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't have to listen to fox to know that obama is a disaster for america.
