I disagree. Even Bill Gates thought software patents were a bad idea before Microsoft had a large inventory of patents. He predicted correctly that software patents would act to stifle, rather than encourage, innovation in software. "The very idea that you have to buy software every year or so is ridiculous. Msft is a dinosaur going extinct." I agree.

You're misinformed, and seem to think every dead person's ballot mailed in has to be democrat. Usually it is a dumb relative who gets the mail, sees the ballot, and duh thinks it is supposed to be sent in for the dead person. It could be equally repub or dem. Your case is nonsense, it is voter suppression, aka Jim Crow politics. Denial of the right to vote violates the Constitution in the most fundamental way.
