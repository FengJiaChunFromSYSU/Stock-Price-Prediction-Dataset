He is a serial liar, we all have seen that first hand, so all the stories of his life are probably untrue. The only thing I don't want to be guilty of is condemning a man who is ill, mentally he is, obviously, but maybe physically as well, and this is all he's got.

The surface pro market is not in the range of your average Christmas Gift unless you give expensive gifts. I started using the different development tools for developers and enterprise developers and there have been things they definitely needed time to work out. The enterprise customers want what they will have no matter what the month. The market is not Christmas shoppers that is more in line with the RT. I have seen large gov. contractors using the WIN8 right now on machines without a touchscreen. I even asked isn't that kind of hard and they all said no. It is smart not to rush it as they are offering something that has never been done and that type of road is always bumpy no matter what. When you are the first and paving the road there will be problems and plenty of them. The bottom line is they are paving the road and in it for the long run. Surface is just one of a pleather of devices. The surface rt is a bargain that I want even though I have several Win 8 machines.

According to the report, Microsoft's operating systems have gone from 97 percent of all computing devices in 2000 -- back when desktop and laptop PCs were dominant -- to 20 percent expected in 2012 -- when PCs, tablets and smartphones are all part of the computing-device picture. Here's a chart from the report showing part of that shift. (The chart shows consumer computing devices, rather than total computing devices -- which includes both consumer and commercial. That's why Microsoft is shown is having 93 percent in 2000 in the chart, as opposed to 97 percent.) =======================================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1355450973505</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-13 21:09:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355451293194-75</Id><Title>Surface RT starts to sell at John Lewis UK this weekend</Title><Msg>Top rated computer retaisl in UK stars to sell Sreface RT this coming weekend.\ Now, four big countries are selling Surface RT.
