The main thing is he was processed through the system and not let go on his word alone..." There are a hundred cases across the nation with far more evidence that are not prosecuted each week, there are many cases for which there is far, far more evidence with "not guilty" verdicts each month. It's too bad the lesson was permanent for Trayvon, but the reality is this is NOT the way the system is supposed to work. The prosecution had no evidence close to removing reasonable doubt. In fact they had none to dispute Zimermen's version of events. Each witness they presented was one for the defense. Now you are left arguing the height of bushes. Too bad you didn't work for the prosecution, catching Zim in such a lie would have convicted him. This case was political because Trayvon could have been Obama's son in appearance. My hope is that no one is killed in the aftermath because we have a corrupt government that pretended there was a case to be made. Now "wrongful death" in a civil sense is a totally different animal, with different standards. My expectation was that that they would get a MS conviction on emotion alone so I am quite proud of the ladies who were mothers themselves, for weighing the facts.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373796457806</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 06:07:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373806086961-6</Id><Topic><Title>Zimmerman: NOT GUILTY!</Title><Username>beelzebufo_ampinga_10048</Username><Timestamp>1373780146762</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 01:35:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not Guilty!

For 349.00 they also have the new Acer Icona W3 which is the first full powered Windows 8 tablet. You can run all Windows programs and it has an Intel Atom. This is the cheapest full powered Windows 8 tablet on the market. You can add a combo stand, keyboard &amp; cover for 69.00. Downside on this is there is no touch pad. A blu tooth wireless can be added but that is another 70 bucks. Bye the way there is a separate touch mouse they call it from Microsoft for Surface etc that is nice. The new gen of machines will be rolling in starting this month. If you do not need a touch pad the Acer is a cheap price for a full power portable. The Surface pro is worlds above this machine though. That is 899.00. However, get ready for a price reduction soon just like the Surface RT which is 150.00 off. The one Staple I went to was throwing in a separate keyboard cover and that was 129 value. I think that may be an exception to the rule as that promo ended I believe. If not you can get the Surface RT for 150.0 off and a free keyboard worth 129.00. Nice.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1373819033823</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 12:23:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1373819043873-13</Id><Topic><Title>Already a miscarriage of justice in Zimermen case because of political considerations</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1373727222530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-07-13 10:53:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He was 16, 1 month before his death.

Cable TV operators need to invest heavily into offering their subscribers new innovative technologies in order to keep their customers.. There is a low float, undiscovered and very undervalued stock that pioneered video on demand (VOD) with TWC a decade ago and is now pioneering a new technology that will revolutionize cable TV, Network DVR (nDVR). The company is Concurrent (CCUR) and it looks ready to soar to new 52-week highs this week. CCUR became the first company to introduce VOD to the market in 2000 when they deployed it with TWC and today, VOD is the fastest growing alternative TV platform in the world - with CCUR's VOD delivery technology reaching 50 million subscribers for a 30% global market share. 1/2 of all U.S. TV households now have a DVR, but CCUR is about to make today's DVR boxes obsolete with new cloud-based nDVRs. CCUR's nDVR technology is already powering TWC's extremely popular start-over and look-back features. Soon, CCUR will begin deploying fully featured nDVR services for its pay-TV clients. CCUR's nDVR technology will allow consumers to record unlimited television content to their account over the cloud, without a DVR box - and play it back on any device - including tablets and smartphones. CCUR finished last week at $7.88 with a market cap of only $68.98 million, cash of $22.37 million, and an enterprise value of $46.61 million or just 0.74X revenues and 6.54X cash flow from operations. CCUR's top rival SEAC is about to reach a new 52-week high and is trading for 1.78X revenues and 15.92X cash flow from operations. SEAC's valuation ratios would value CCUR around $15.50 per share!</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1373854771815</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-07-14 22:19:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
