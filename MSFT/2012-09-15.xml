Perhaps you should stay focused on personal and business bankruptcies, your areas of personal expertise, and leave the real work of international relations to sane people.

Both sides like to put their spin on the results, however bad they look. Each wants to take comfort from a little piece of data hidden inside. But how does the average voter find out which poll he or she should you believe and which polls are there merely as a distraction? Costas Panagopoulos of Fordham University, surveying 23 polling organizations, prepared a list showing which organizations were most accurate in their final poll before the 2008 election. Two — Rasmussen Reports and the Pew Research Center — got the result dead right, Panagopoulos says. Of the other 21, 17 over-estimated support for Barack Obama, while just four said John McCain would receive a larger percentage of the vote than he actually did. The big media organizations almost universally failed to give readers a final accurate prediction, with Newsweek coming in dead last, just behind polls for CBS/New York Times; Reuters/C-Span/Zogby and Gallup. Polls carried out for Fox, NBC, ABC, the Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal were also all in the bottom half of Panagopoulos’ study.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347713250095</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 08:47:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347713250688-8</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA IS FOOLING YOU.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1347641352210</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-09-14 12:49:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Poll Survey: Rasmussen, Pew Most Accurate in 2008 Tuesday, 11 Sep 2012 07:37 AM By Martin Gould As the presidential election gets ever closer, new polls come out nearly every day, some suggesting that President Barack Obama is gaining an unassailable lead, others predicting challenger Mitt Romney is inching ahead.

Polk" justification for seeking an office that he's incompetent to fill. Crass seeking of personal political gain in the face of attacks on our interests that result in the loss of the lives of our public servants is no surprise when it's exhibited in such a disgusting and ill-considered fashion by the right wing. Comparing Romney to Carter as your incoherent and poorly composed nonsense apparently does leaves Romney in even a poorer light.Romney's foolish and misguided self interested thrashings have never been equalled in the modern era. Frankly, his campaign may as well admit that he's running as the reincarnation of Joseph Smith, although Romney's moral fiber and personal convictions are even more questionable. Once again, you'd be best off sticking to opining on bankruptcy and financial ruin, your areas of personal expertise. Your political aspirations died with Wallace and LeMay.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1347717874820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 10:04:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347718586848-14</Id><Topic><Title>Foreign policy</Title><Username>harrydokes</Username><Timestamp>1347718008977</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 10:06:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Foreign policy analysis" for morans.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1347718586848</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-15 10:16:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347719315394-15</Id><Title>Must SEE This!

If your right wing destroy American values party wants to exend blame to GWB, fine, because that also is true, but blaming serves no purpose. If you loan your car to someone and it comes back with a ruined engine, you can blame all you want but the facts are the engine is ruined and somehow you have to rebuild it.

The Kenyan never was nor will he ever be, a Christian. Christians don't sit in a racist black panther black theology "church" for over 20 years. Christians don't bow to their Musllim King. Christians don't tell other Christians that they shouldn't "hug their Bibles." Christians don't attack the Bible. Christians don't tell Israel to go back to their '67 borders. Christians don't start their own personal illegal war in Libya and murder thousands of innocent women and children to further their own personal faction of Islam to take power. Greg, also, go to Youtube and type in "obama visits mosque Istanbul Turkiye" That Musllim pos from Kenya went there right after he was illegally inaugurated. But then again, all Christians DO THAT. Those vermin wouldn't LET a Christian set foot in their Mosque, but they let their Musllim brother, Barack, do the grand tour.
