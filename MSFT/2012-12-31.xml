The Clinton economy flatlined during the first 2 years. After Reps took over Congress and forced Clinton to stop the spending the economy boomed. The Bush tax cuts resulted in the U.S. Treasury collecting more taxes than at any other time during the history of the country. And another thing... we had the economic collapse due to sub-prime mortgages, not because of tax cuts! The government - by law (Community Re-Development Act) forced banks to lend $$ to people who couldn't afford it. It was simply a case of Gov. Socialism interfering with the Free Market System.

Really?</Title><Msg>Microsoft Surface RT Is the Best Tablet Ever – Best Buy Customers SHARE: Adjust text size: Microsoft has recently decided to allow retailers in select countries to sell the Surface RT tablet too, in a move clearly meant to help increase sales of the device. Best Buy is one of the stores that got the Surface RT last weekend and, up until now, it seems like Microsoft’s efforts to make the device available in other stores are quickly paying off. Most of the customers that purchased a Surface RT from Best Buy are absolutely delighted with the product and expressed their excitement on the official product page of the tablet. “Awesome device! The device is very responsive and have found it very productive in actually getting things done. I am writing this review on my Surface. I am also an HTC 8X owner and am just as impressed with this Device. The windows 8 system is the future, syncing all of you devices is a breeze!” one of the customers said. The Surface RT is currently listed on Best Buy’s website with an overall rating of 4.7 stars out of 5, with 96 percent of reviewers claiming they would recommend the device to a friend. Some of the customers have even revealed they had sold their iPads to switch to the Surface which, to be honest, is probably pretty exciting news for the Redmond-based technology giant. “I recently sold my iPad 2 and used the money to put towards my brand new Surface RT. I could not have made a better choice,” one of the buyers explained. As always, Microsoft is yet to disclose some official sales statistics concerning the Surface RT, but the company’s decision to bring the device in third-party stores is clearly boosting sales. Aside from the official Microsoft Stores, those who want to purchase the Surface with Windows RT can find it at various retailers in France, the UK and US.</Msg><Username>bengraham650</Username><Timestamp>1356979553509</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 13:45:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356980076355-66</Id><Title>The Grinch who won’t let her kids have iPods</Title><Msg>Google it....</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1356980076355</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 13:54:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356980119786-67</Id><Title>Deal will come this evening</Title><Msg>you watch</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1356980119786</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 13:55:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1356980189664-68</Id><Title>Republicans Got A Good Godamn Arsewailing!

Money comes into existence when someone adds it to her portfolio of assets. This occurs either when she borrows money (which creates new cash from reserves) or sells securities to the Federal Reserve (which injects new cash into the system). Neither of these scenarios allows the central bank to increase the supply of money beyond demand, the story told by those in the money growth == inflation camp. Instead, inflation happens first. This then means that agents need more cash for transactions, leading them to borrow more or sell government securities to the Fed. Thus, the money growth accompanies inflation, but it does not cause it. The original post can be found here:" Forbes "what actually causes inflation" I know if "feels" good to hold the simple minded view but it is still wrong.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1356996096438</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 18:21:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356996145692-85</Id><Topic><Title>Note for non economic able posters, excess demand does not create inflation.</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1356994132164</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-12-31 17:48:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually some of us THINK instead of drinking whatever kool aid is served to us.
