That said, with all of the bad press surrounding W8, I was curious about it. Last weekend I was in Staples and saw a display set up for a few Windows 8 machines, so I decided to give it a try. It took about 5 minutes to sort of figure out how to move between pages, etc., but I found it pretty intuitive overall. I think that MSFT is a little early on creating a rather seamless OS that operates similarly to mobile devices and tablets. If they stick to they're plan, I think the public, which is understandably uncomfortable with the pace of change of such things, will come around to it. Once they do, perhaps MSFT will get back on top of their game, in a very competitive arena. I might buy my position in the stock back soon.</Msg><Username>planet_reagan</Username><Timestamp>1366376509921</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 09:01:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366376692842-31</Id><Title>look at all the desperate shorts</Title><Msg>Hey morons, you're all wrong.

Quoting: "Technology research and advisory firm Gartner predicted in a recent report that shipments of devices using Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOG) Android will far exceed shipments of Windows personal computers and phones by 2017. "Further, Gartner predicts that by 2017 the number of tablets, mobile phones and ultra-mobile devices will total 2.7 billion units, roughly 10 times the number of desktop and notebook personal computers. These expectations reflect the pervasive belief that the future in computing is clearly mobile. "Should these expectations materialize, it would spell certain doom for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), whose software and other products depend heavily on the personal computer. The company was extremely late to the mobile game, and still doesn't have a pronounced footprint in mobile. "With this in mind, could tech giant Microsoft really cease to exist only a few short years from now? Is it really on the brink of vanishing from the Earth, or are fears of the company’s impending irrelevance overblown? "Could Microsoft really disappear? "It’s certainly true that when it comes to global smartphone sales, Google is the elephant in the room. The company’s Android devices accounted for nearly 70% of all smartphone shipments in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to a separate Gartner research report. This represented a 18 percentage point increase in market share versus the fourth quarter of 2011.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1366381373197</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 10:22:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366381382713-48</Id><Topic><Title>Boston Bomber is Saudi National</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1366292264766</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:37:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Finally a way to shut up the Feeces.

The extent of the year-on-year contraction marked the worst quarter since IDC began tracking the PC market quarterly in 1994. The results also marked the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year shipment declines. "Despite some mild improvement in the economic environment and some new PC models offering Windows 8, PC shipments were down significantly across all regions compared to a year ago. Fading Mini Notebook shipments have taken a big chunk out of the low-end market while tablets and smartphones continue to divert consumer spending. PC industry efforts to offer touch capabilities and ultraslim systems have been hampered by traditional barriers of price and component supply, as well as a weak reception for Windows 8. The PC industry is struggling to identify innovations that differentiate PCs from other products and inspire consumers to buy, and instead is meeting significant resistance to changes perceived as cumbersome or costly."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1366388683020</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 12:24:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366388727868-94</Id><Title>Why So Many Negative Media Stories on MSFT?</Title><Msg>It can't be ideology since MSFT is in bed with radical leftist media ideology.

We should demand that big media be compelled to reveal the personal investments of their executives and analysts in rivals of MSFT .

The dumb who just repeat what others say to keep their job and the other kind have an agenda to manipulate the price of a stock. Both the media and sell side analysts will not help you make money investing. If you listen to them you are almost certain to lose money.

I am a consultant and see many firms, large firms, that have postponed or cancelled upgrades to Windows 8 as it makes tasks that were formally simple, much more complex. The lack of the start button, the restart, log off, and shut down aspects, the difficulty if is to find recently installed or any existing program, the fact that so many features are hidden, i.e, the Charms area, the lack of a simple run comman area, are just a handful of items that companies and individuals depend on. They have tried to appeal to a tablet audience with the metro interface but at the same time, alienated their core market. I see no reason why they could not have kept the things I mentioned above as well as the metro interface. Then they make the upgrade path easier while still opening new markets.</Msg><Username>jpmniles</Username><Timestamp>1366396679854</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 14:37:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366396777962-130</Id><Topic><Title>Numbers missed, PC sales are weak, Surface a total failure</Title><Username>cspanosmwc</Username><Timestamp>1366324208488</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 18:30:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But, wally, you're a #$%$</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366396777962</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 14:39:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366396850365-131</Id><Topic><Title>Ballmer wake up?!

We know M$ is #$%$...now we know why... ------------------------------------------------------ It's been only a few weeks since the Linux Foundation released its report that enterprise use of Linux continues to rise, but on Wednesday fresh data came out that suggests the same is true of open source software in general. Specifically, Black Duck Software and North Bridge Venture Partners today announced the results of the seventh annual Future of Open Source Survey, which found that open source software has matured to such an extent that it now influences everything from innovation to collaboration among competitors to hiring practices. "It's been recognized that software is eating the world,” said Michael Skok, general partner at North Bridge Venture Partners. “Our survey points to the fact that open source is eating the software world." With more than 800 respondents from both vendor and non-vendor communities, the 2013 survey reflects the views of the largest sample in its history.

Consumers, businesses and government agencies are far more enthusiastic to embrace open source solutions than before. The growth of Android alone is a great example. In the Linux world several of the most popular distros began to make radical changes to the user interface in the spirit of "modernization". However most of these changes were eye candy and had nothing to do with real productivity. When long term users complained the were ignored at first. When the customers began to fork their own versions of Linux the big distros responded and remade their distros to both the modern and traditional interface. The true beauty of open source is the ability for users to make their wishes heard or develop a solution of their own. Microsoft has an opportunity to play a staring role going forward,especially in new convertibles tablets enabled by Intel's new Haswell and BayTrail processors available soon. But to realize this opportunity Microsoft needs to take customers feedback far more seriously and become more customer centric in general. If Microsoft gets it right we might see, as Intel's CEO predicted W8 tablets available as low as $200-$300, and many of those could be dual-boot or multi-boot with Windows/Android/Ubuntu Touch/Tizen and users will have choice. Consumers would be thrilled and we could see explosive growth for years to come.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1366408141643</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 17:49:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366410751087-164</Id><Topic><Title>Open source is taking over the software world, survey says</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366396900046</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 14:41:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I know Linux and Open Source.
