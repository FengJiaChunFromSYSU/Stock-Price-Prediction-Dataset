The argument is: Asia will burn coal anyway. So they may as well burn our low sulfur coal which will pollute less. But America will NOT burn coal! We will have wind farms and solar panel farms.

Another Lesson in Quality vs Quantity</Title><Msg>The "genius" ads are beside the point. For the record, the only thing I see annoying about the ads is the use of the word "genius". It doesn't take a genius to use a Mac computer. The point is how much companies spend on advertising, and the sales results they get. (Whether the advertising "causes" the sales is problematical.) http://www.forbes.com/sites/ycharts/2012/08/02/who-spends-more-on-ads-apple-or-microsoft-another-lesson-in-quality-vs-quantity/?partner=yahoofeed Apple (AAPL) has run some new commercials –- featuring a blue-shirted genius — during the Olympics. The genius in the ad seems marginally less annoying than the real Apple geniuses giving you attitude behind the bar at retail stores, but critics have been harsh. A former creative director of ad firm TBWA/Chiat/Day blogged that the new ads are “causing a widespread gagging response” and he “honestly can’t remember a single Apple campaign that’s been received so poorly.” It’s not quite on the level of Groupon’s (GRPN) offensive Superbowl ads, but it’s a definite advertising miss. Here’s a reassuring thought: This is getting people riled up precisely because it’s such a rare misstep for Apple’s image-makers. Also, Apple has one of the strongest brands around, and its advertising spend is not even $1 billion. According to its annual filing, Apple spent $933 million on advertising last year, $691 million in 2010, and $501 million in 2009. Its total sales those years were $108.249 billion, $65.225 billion and $42.905 billion. Translation: Apple spent less than 1% of sales last year on advertising. And its sales growth has been far outpacing its advertising budget. That has helped it achieve this: AAPL Revenue TTM Chart AAPL Revenue TTM data by YCharts How does that compare to, say, Microsoft (MSFT)? Advertising in Redmond was $1.6 billion in fiscal 2012 (its year ends in June), $1.9 billion in 2011, and $1.6 billion in 2010. As a percentage of sales, advertising was 2.2%, 2.7%, 2.6%. And last year, ad expenses grew 19% while sales grew only 12%. MSFT Revenue TTM Chart MSFT Revenue TTM data by YCharts Over at Dell (DELL), meanwhile, that company spent $860 million last fiscal year, $730 million in 2011, and $619 million in 2010. That’s 1.3%, 1.2% and 1.2% of total sales. And last year, sales growth didn’t keep up with the advertising budget.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343920475000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 11:14:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343921989000-23</Id><Topic><Title>How many years to MSFT self destruct?</Title><Username>obadidoss</Username><Timestamp>1343882142000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 00:35:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Depends on what you mean by "self-destruct". Microsoft is already widely considered to be a company in decline. A dead man walking, if you like. In that sense the company has already destroyed itself, with the help of some rivals. A comeback from that state is unlikely. When Microsoft is no longer considered dominant in any market, it could be considered destroyed in another sense. That could well happen by 2015. When Microsoft is acquired or goes bankrupt or moves to a different business, it could be considered destroyed in yet another sense. A precise estimate of that is impossible, but the time when Bill Gates will be fully divested at the current rate, or the time when the company will have bought back all its own stock, could give a reasonable estimate.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1343921989000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 11:39:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343922819000-24</Id><Topic><Title>Obama no WARN notices until after the election</Title><Username>gpphillip96</Username><Timestamp>1343862191000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 19:03:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually this may now have the opposite impact of what he is expecting.

If there's one thing that hardcore gamers covet more than anything, it's performance. This is a category of user that will spend crazy money and do even crazier things to squeeze as much performance out of a game as possible. These people buy "Extreme Edition" processors, kit their PCs out with dual high-end GPUs, and install elaborate cooling systems. These are the kind of people who would switch to Linux in a heartbeat. Microsoft should be worried about this. While the gamer market is relatively small -- thanks in recent years to the popularity of consoles -- it's an incredibly influential one, and, if Valve and other publishers start offering games for the platform, it could force the hand of the large OEMs to offer Linux-based gaming PCs. OEMs will follow the money, and hardcore gamers never seem short of a few thousand bucks to spend on new systems. Hardcore gaming could give Linux the credibility is needs to gain traction in the consumer market. It starts with gaming PCs, and then it moves on to general-purpose PCs -- and by then Microsoft could be having to dig itself out of a deep hole." http://www.zdnet.com/valve-linux-runs-our-games-faster-than-windows-7-7000002060/</Msg><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343944427000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 17:53:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343946130000-47</Id><Title>Hawaii will trade Obama for a Chic Fil-A....</Title><Msg>...in a heart beat.

Timmerman Bio ↓ on Sep 26th, 2011 Comments ↓ [Editor's note: See David Horowitz calling out Grover Norquiist and Suhail Khan here. See also Frank Gaffney exposing both Norquiist and Khan's troubling connections.] “To illustrate the danger of the first approach of evil habit, the Arabs have a proverb, ‘Beware of the camel’s nose,’” wrote 19th century British author, Lydia Sigourney. Why? Because once the camel gets its nose inside the tent, his body will soon follow. And once the camel gets inside the tent, the former occupants face a choice: leave the tent, or lie down in the camel’s bed. The Republican primary victory of Imad Afif “David” Ramaadan in the 87th legislative district in Virginia on Aug. 23 reminds me of this Arab proverb – not because Ramaadan is the camel’s nose. If anything, he is the camel’s tail. Imad Ramaadan is just the latest of a series of Moooslim protégés discovered and promoted by Republican activist Grover Norquiist, the man whose vicious personal attacks on conservative Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma over ethanol subsidies earlier this year (Norquiist favored the corporate hand-outs; Coburn opposed them) prompted Coburn’s chief of staff to respond that Norquiist has become the “chief cleric of shariia tax law.” What’s wrong with Moooslims running for public office or assuming prominent positions in the conservative movement? Nothing at all – as long as they are clear about the primacy of the U.S. Constitution over Koraanic (or Shariia) law. Where does Imad Afif “David” Ramaadan stand on this crucial question? The answer is – well, unclear. And that’s when the camel begins to spit. In his campaign literature, Ramaadan touts his respect for the U.S. Constitution, his love of America, and his “story” as an immigrant from Lebaanon living the American dream. But nowhere does he mention why he really left Lebaanon, or</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1343952860000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 20:14:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343952993000-54</Id><Topic><Title>The painting company hired to paint ....</Title><Username>kalafella</Username><Timestamp>1343946970000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 18:36:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>craper, what do you have on your resume besides bank teller.?

Mitt's habitual tax evasion and casual fraud and perjury tho chat about at the water cooler. "Romney initially refused to make a copy of his Massachusetts tax returns public, even a copy with the income information redacted. Suspicions only grew more intense after the Globe’s Frank Phillips reported that Romney had paid property taxes on his Park City, Utah, home as his primary residence for 1999, 2000, and 2001. Campaign aide Eric Fehrnstrom said that had happened because of a “clerical mistake” by the relevant county assessor’s office in Utah, an account that office pretty much backed up, though no one could say quite how the unusual error had occurred. ..... He had only amended those returns to “resident” in April of 2002, after deciding to run for governor here. Claiming he had always intended to return to Massachusetts, Romney said he had come to realize he should have filed as a resident when discussing the state’s election laws with his attorneys." Retroactive residency is like retroactive retirement. Retroactive candidacies bring the whole Jenga tower down.

Never. $19 trillion wasted and counting for LBJ's "Great Society" "War on Poverty" schemes. "These mandatory payments – which buy absolutely no goods or services – will squeeze out funding for all other priorities." The megabuck junkies and their herds of unelected harassacrats in that commune on the Potomac are more concerned about keeping their fancy perks than they are about the USA/American people. Just look at the disgusting mess that they have created. Here's part of the report card on all of the damage caused by all of those Commiecrat/Prog, aka Democrat, schemes: &gt;&gt;Over the long run, as the baby boomers retire and health care costs continue to grow, the situation will become far worse. By 2025 revenue will be able to finance only interest payments, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social curity. Every other federal government activity – from national defense and homeland security to transportation and energy – will have to be paid for with borrowed money. Debt held by the public will outstrip the entire American economy, growing to as much as 185 percent of GDP by 2035. Interest on the debt could rise to nearly $1 trillion by 2020. These mandatory payments – which buy absolutely no goods or services – will squeeze out funding for all other priorities.&lt;&lt; - Report of the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, December, 2010 November 6, 2012, if we are still allowed to vote, FIRE every Democrat across the USA; get it done!!!</Msg><Username>dons_st</Username><Timestamp>1343962444000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 22:54:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343964407000-72</Id><Topic><Title>Can You Really Get Rich Using Stock Trading Techniques?</Title><Username>farmermcgee185</Username><Timestamp>1343922932000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 11:55:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Interesting!</Msg><Username>maxwellpope271</Username><Timestamp>1343964407000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 23:26:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
