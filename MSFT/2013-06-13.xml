BZZZZT, wrong answer</Title><Msg>On The Register now... Microsoft's Windows 8.1 update and the rise of tablet-cum-laptop PCs may boost sales for the software titan and its hardware-making pals - but it won't happen anytime soon. Or so predicts IT distribution channel beancounter Canalys in its global shipment forecast for 2013: the analysts estimates little more than 493 million PCs will be flogged this year. Broken down, that equates to 105 million desktops, a drop of 5.4 per cent on 2012; 206.5m notebooks, representing a decline of 12.1 per cent; and 114.6 million slabs, indicating growth of 59.2 per cent. As world + dog knows, the new touchscreen-friendly Windows 8 operating system failed to live up to its billing. Microsoft expected it to usher in a new era of notebook-cum-tab fondling, but that hasn't happened. "These convertible products have disappointed so far," said James Wong, an analyst at Canalys. These convertible laptop-fondleslab computers are expected to make up just two per cent of the market this year, we're told.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1371096152273</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 00:02:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371096608613-2</Id><Title>Sony sucker-punches Xbox on price, specs, DRM-free gaming</Title><Msg>On The register now. How M$ has already failed with the XPox 1... Quote:- Sony unveiled the new PS4 console at this week's E3 gamers conference in Los Angeles, and it undercuts Redmond Xbox One by $100, has faster graphics, won't require an internet connection for gaming, or make users jump through tortuous DRM hoops. CEO Jack Tretton took care to put the boot into Microsoft as he unveiled the platform. "We are focused on delivering what gamers want most without imposing restrictions or devaluing their PlayStation purchase. PlayStation 4 won't impose any new restrictions on the use of used games. That's a good thing," he said, with a broad grin at the thunderous response from the E3 crowd. "When people buy a PS4 disc they have the rights to use that game," he said, "they can trade in the game at retail, sell it to another person, lend it to a friend, or keep it forever. PlayStation 4 games don't need to be connected online to play or for any type of authentication. And it won’t stop working if you haven't authenticated in 24 hours."</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1371096608613</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 00:10:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371097424035-3</Id><Title>XBox One sucker-punches PS4 on features, cloud gaming, group play</Title><Msg>At the same time MSFT sucker-punches Sony on gaming model profitability</Msg><Username>oncmillionaire</Username><Timestamp>1371097424035</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 00:23:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371097940892-4</Id><Topic><Title>Scandal du jour leading us further and further from Benghazi</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1370996021221</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-06-11 20:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"I missed it, who gave Rice the lies to tell and why?"

Republican and Democratic lawmakers say the discussions about retiring now, in order to be grandfathered into their currently generous Federal Employee Health Benefits program, are constant. Taxpayer-subsidized premiums for Congress will disappear at the end of the year under a Republican-mandated provision in Obamacare that forces lawmakers and staff onto the same government health care exchanges that the rest of the citizenry must use, which will cost them a lot more than they are paying now. The provision says the government can only offer members of Congress and their staff plans that are created in the bill or offered through an exchange. Well, conservative members will participate steadfastly in principle on this requirement, but Democrats and all of their honorable "moderate" Republican pals will make this all disappear.

The point is, charging customers to play a game that is already paid for is a horrible idea. People I know all around me that are huge xbox fans are outraged and refuse to buy an xbox one. They are all fleeing to the PS4. Wait until xbox one sales miss huge. This stock will tank 10%+. Add on top of that the horrible OS Windows 8 which no one I know likes.

The government uses the figure in its calculations to weigh "costs" and "benefits" of proposed envirokook regulations. With the arbitrary 60% increase in the number, government actions with regard to "clean" energy and "green" initiatives will appear more valuable in its cost-benefit analyses. In addition, the figure is used to demonstrate how high the "social costs" are for projects that could generate carbon-based emissions. Even supporters questioned the way the administration slipped the policy out without first opening it for public comment. The change was buried in an afternoon announcement on May 31 about efficiency standards for microwave ovens. As long as you vote for these emotion-based, pseudo-intellectual, liberal kook busybodies, you get what you deserve. Like unemployment, terminated pensions, high taxes and a low information public.</Msg><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1371141897326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 12:44:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371142009461-80</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft Becomes #24 Most Shorted Dow Stock, Replacing Pfizer</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1371134712913</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 10:45:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he is only wrong when he doesn't contradict himself. when he does he says he was right both tomes. :-D</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1371142009461</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 12:46:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371142534002-81</Id><Topic><Title>How Kook Liberalism Will Finally Destroy America</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1371141897326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 12:44:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What would the typical fukery posting RWNJ put the social cost of carbon at ??

M$ are just plain incompetent... Quote:- Microsoft is attracting fresh criticism for its handling of the Citadel botnet takedown, with some security researchers pointing to signs that the zombie network is already rising from the grave again. Redmond worked with financial service organisations, other technology firms and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to disrupt more than 1,400 botnets linked to $500m in fraud as part of a takedown action, codenamed Operation b54. In a blog post, Microsoft described its seventh zombie network takedown as its "most aggressive botnet operation to date". However, security researchers such as Roman Hüssy of Abuse.ch criticised the action for killing off honeypot systems monitoring the activities of cybercrooks as well as seizing internet nodes linked to ongoing fraud. Microsoft seized more than 4,000 domain names and pointed them towards a server operated Redmond as part of the sinkholing exercise. But these domains included more than 300 Citadel domains that were sinkholed by abuse.ch as well as many hundreds of similar domains controlled by other security researchers. It's being suggested that the move thrashed the work of security researchers as well as hampering attempts by groups such as the Shadowserver Foundation to track the activity of malware networks, such as reporting on the IP address of zombies that phone home to command and control nodes under the control of security researchers.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1371148914292</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 14:41:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371148918311-110</Id><Topic><Title>why is fox news sooo stewp id.</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1371128699863</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 09:04:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>never mind if you don't get it.

Pay for only what you want. The Xbox becomes your cable box. It is wireless. You say XBOX On, XBOX CNBC etc., If many people are in the room talkin you use your nokia lumia as the remote. Will the Sony have exclusive show and already made exclusives with NFL. Many guys pay 75 bucks a month for a football package from their cable providers. You will get on side exclusives, overlays and a football experience that is awesome. That does not mean headphone conversations, that was not approved. The NFL and teams will all use Microsoft Surfaces while on the field though. I think that really made Apple people go crazy Send Prozac to Apple please. What about exclusive content from Stephen Speilberg, pay for only what you want probably justifies the price alone. Does exclusive music and a great music experience just the cost. Hook up a pair a bose speakers ~first thing I did!~ and it will be the best music experience of your life. You have not only every song, you have the smart DJ. Type a song you liked 10 years ago and it will pick 10-20 songs similar and I bet you will say how did it do that? What about a built in blu ray? Can you integrate with you Windows 8 devices on the Sony? Can you Surf the web on your live screen TV on a Sony? Oh forgot, surf the web at the same time as doing everything above. Does the Sony run on the Windows Kernal? How about HD high Definition big screen group conference calls via Skype. Yes, Skype is integrated. How about, this is all done in the same programming language all the developers or using for Windows 8 using Visual Studio 12 &amp; Microsoft Blend. Well kind of sort of. The may have to learn C++ for effects &amp; Direct X but it is similar and there will probably be ~asset shortcuts~ real soon that make all that easy. So if you have a platform that can do all this and is programmed in one language, I see Apple developers jumping the ship and Apple knows it now</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1371153509128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:58:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371153567841-152</Id><Topic><Title>Forget About Angry Birds</Title><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1371151339758</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:22:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What a great time to switch to FREE Open Source Linux.</Msg><Username>penguinx64</Username><Timestamp>1371153567841</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:59:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371153644754-153</Id><Topic><Title>Sony Play Station is $100 cheaper than XBOX ONE so what!</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1371153509128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:58:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>XBOX ONE will also have heartbeat monitoring WITHOUT a wire.

Here's what I find: "An informal probe into the search leader's deals with handset makers is in a "preliminary stage," according to The Financial Times, which cites a leaked document. "In April, a group of Google's rivals told EU antitrust regulators that Google uses its Android software as a 'Trojan Horse,' giving it away and then capitalizing on the resulting traffic. The group, called FairSearch, is backed by Microsoft (MSFT), Expedia (EXPE), Oracle (ORCL) and TripAdvisor (TRIP), among others. "The group says Google's free Android distribution is "predatory" because releasing it "below cost makes it difficult for other providers" to compete. "The open-source Android software is distributed worldwide on smartphones and tablets. Google makes money from its platform by selling ads against Web searches and other services that come standard on Android. Thus, Android's growth helps boost Google's ad revenue." ________________________________________ A "leaked document"?? Imagine that... "Backed by Microsoft"?

Obviously you are not a gamer. Me and many of my friends and work colleagues that play video games are extremely upset with Microsoft's licensing of games and making people pay to play games on other xbox ones that are borrowed or given to other friends that have an xbox one. I personally know people who are Halo/Xbox fanboys and THEY ARE NOT BUYING AN XBOX ONE. The refuse to pay to play games that are already paid for. With the new Xbox one, there is now no advantage to being a console gamer over a pc gamer. Also GAMERS DONT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN GAMING! You see the PS4 concentrated on the GAMING and what did Microsoft do? They added all this extra fluff that gamers could care less about. With the Xbox 360 it was all about the games and was a HUGE success. You can be in denial about the Xbox one all you want and you can keep thinking its great, but take it from a gamer, WE GAMERS WILL NOT BUY YOUR POS XBOX ONE!!!!</Msg><Username>ultravis66</Username><Timestamp>1371155832370</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 16:37:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371156397451-164</Id><Topic><Title>Sony Play Station is $100 cheaper than XBOX ONE so what!</Title><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1371153509128</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:58:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The M$hills never get it - they are just drooling M$ fanbois with no idea.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1371156397451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 16:46:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371156500427-165</Id><Topic><Title>PS4 Sold Out for release day on Amazon, XBox One still available. hmm.....

"In terms of the initial sales of Xbox One and the PS4 I think the hundred dollar price difference will make a difference," said Lewis Ward, research manager for gaming at IDC. "It will probably set up Sony to at least have the opportunity to emerge as the top eighth-generation console sales leader." When Microsoft announced the price of its new console at a press event Monday there was an audible gasp from the audience of gamers and media. The US$499 price tag is higher than the $375 to $450 range that Ward predicted ahead of E3. Part of the reason for the premium is because the Xbox One comes prepackaged with a Kinect sensor. Sony's PlayStation 4 won't require the additional depth-sensing camera and microphone combination that Kinect offers. A game developer who was waiting to try Microsoft's Xbox One, but did not want to be identified by name, said he currently owns an Xbox 360, but that, "Microsoft has completely lost me." He said that being forced to buy a Kinect sensor and pay a $100 premium is what turned him off. He said he plans to buy a PlayStation 4 when it becomes available later this year. "I like the PS4 more and the whole $100 less helps out a little," said Jonathan Toyoda another gamer attending E3 who owns the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. He said that he'd put the $100 towards buying another game.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic6</Username><Timestamp>1371159575598</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 17:39:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371159865215-189</Id><Topic><Title>POLL: Is something in another galaxy 'near Earth' In hawcreek land it is..</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1371151458359</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:24:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Yet Faux chose the title."

With the possible exception of some satellite dwarf galaxies, the Andromeda Galaxy is nearer to the Milky Way than any other galaxy, and moving rapidly nearer. It is so near, in fact that it is expected to collide with the Milky Way in only about two billion years -- the mere blink of an eye compared to the expected future of the universe, which has been described as on the order of ten-to-the-hundredth-power years. Earth will be becoming unihabitable by then anyway because of the heating up of the Sun and loss of water from Earth's surface, so the collision with Andromeda doesn't greatly constrain the time we have left before we must contrive the Diaspora -- the spreading of our species throughout our galaxy. But perhaps you are too small-minded to consider a two billion year deadline to be at all urgent.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1371172232852</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 21:10:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371176914649-210</Id><Topic><Title>Volume is picking up....</Title><Username>longsrboss</Username><Timestamp>1371153091927</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:51:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>volume is below normal.</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1371176914649</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:28:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371177131654-211</Id><Topic><Title>Wow - it must be worse than I</Title><Username>ossobucco20l2</Username><Timestamp>1371152587871</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 15:43:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>go l2! who needs the real thing when the imposter is so many times better? :-D</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1371177131654</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 22:32:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371179889784-212</Id><Title>I guess the Japanese are still better with numbers than Americans</Title><Msg>Their Central Bank began printing money to copy our Fed and the Yen rapidly devalued, their Market took off like a rocket mid November last . But it took them a few months to figure out the scam. Printing does not create wealth. Of course their Central Bankers may not have been pumping every day, or actively participating in the market, but they went from rocket ride to begin full Bear 20%+ rapid crash in 6 months sharp. They are smarter than Americans who are still chasers of air. Volume volume, volume. May 31st, last day we were down 200+ points from open the volume was twice what today's was. Nobody today was buying to own, they were buying to cover or trade, We're in deep sh**, there is no recovery.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1371179889784</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-06-13 23:18:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
