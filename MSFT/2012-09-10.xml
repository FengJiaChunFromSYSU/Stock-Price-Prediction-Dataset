Only Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11, his highly critical examination of the first term of President George W Bush, retains the #1 position with $119.1M. It’s extremely unlikely that 2016 Obama’s America will make even half that. But it now has made more money (not adjusted for inflation or higher ticket prices) than Moore’s Sicko (2007 – $24.5M), Oscar-winner Bowling For Columbine (2002 – $21.5M), and Capitalism: A Love Story (2009 – $14.3M). The right-wing doc 2016 Obama’s America is produced by Gerald R. Molen who in fact credits “learning some lessons” from Moore. “When he released Fahrenheit 9/11 in 2004 ahead of the election, it sparked intense debate.” 2016 Obama’s America also has passed the box office for Al Gore’s and Davis Guggenheim’s An Inconvenient Truth (2006 – $24.1M) and is the #1 biggest-grossing conservative political docu ever (besting Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed’s $7.7M). The Rocky Mountain Pictures film benefitted from the runup to the Republican National Convention. Now the anti-Obama film is hot in 2012′s battleground states where GOP candidate Mitt Romney and President Obama are campaigning the heaviest: Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Virginia, Georgia, Illinois, Arizona. (California and New York and Texas also are listed in the Top 10 states contributing the most gross dollars to the documentary’s box office.) Based on conservative author Dinesh D’Souza’s 2010 best-selling book The Roots Of Obama’s Rage, it initially opened in only one theater in Houston on July 13th, then expanded to 1,000+ theaters and now 2,000+ locations. by Friday. 2016 Obama’s America is co-directed by D’Souza and John Sullivan and produced by Academy Award winner Gerald R. Molen (co-producer of Schindler’s List). 2016 Obama’s America detractors decry it as a slick infomercial heavy with conspiracy theories. But D’Souza says he made the film to motivate moviegoers to question what an Obama second term would look like. Its success was aided by savvy marketing: exhibitors were reporting busloads arriving at theaters around the country in pre-organized trips. It also employed much of the same selling techniques used to garner attention and support for faith-based films, understandable since the audience is overlapping. Its campaign included advertising nationally on talk radio and cable news channels including Fox News Channel, A&amp;E, History and MSNBC.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1347285813569</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 10:03:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347285895177-27</Id><Topic><Title>LARRY FLINT OFFERS $1 MILLION FOR MITT ROMNEY'S TAX RETURN</Title><Username>c.luke44</Username><Timestamp>1347200060609</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 10:14:20 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Luke is a commie POS and dont buy any mags. that commie flint puts out.</Msg><Username>raul_10_spain</Username><Timestamp>1347285895177</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 10:04:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347285949183-28</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY IS A FRAUD</Title><Username>c.luke44</Username><Timestamp>1347198687584</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 09:51:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lukes mother is a fraud for raising a commie POS #$%$</Msg><Username>raul_10_spain</Username><Timestamp>1347285949183</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 10:05:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347286067115-29</Id><Topic><Title>Vice President Joe Biden said, "it happens to be a three-letter word: Jobs.

Mack faces federal charges including conspiracy to obstruct commerce by extortion. Joseph "JoJo" Giorgianni, a top campaign contributor, and six others were also taken into custody. Information on their attorneys wasn't immediately available. Specific charges against the suspects are expected to be outlined by Paul Fishman, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, later Monday. Mack and the others arrested Monday were brought to the FBI office in Hamilton for processing and are scheduled to appear in federal court. The arrests are the latest development in an ongoing federal investigation into alleged corruption within Mack's administration, which has been marked by accusations of nepotism and reckless spending. In July, FBI agents searched offices in Trenton City Hall a day after raiding the mayor's home. They also searched the home of his brother, Ralpiel Mack, and that of Giorgianni. Mack's administration has been in turmoil from Day 1, staggering from one crisis to another. A housecleaning of staff at City Hall opened the door for Mack's own appointees, who quickly turned it into a revolving door. Some left over questions about their credentials, others to face criminal charges.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1347286426812</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 10:13:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347286596215-31</Id><Topic><Title>Obamanure Welfare State for another four years is the Liberal's promise!</Title><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1347247781321</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 23:29:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>obdeeldo care? talk about a sick joke- he is in the service of the Oligarchs Charlie and Davie- either they are pumping money to him or they had his brain modified ala the Stepford Wives</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1347286596215</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 10:16:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347289417229-32</Id><Title>Source of Obama's Dismal Failure Discovered!</Title><Msg>Obama told supporters yesterday that American manufacturers are "making products that we sell around the world, marked with 3 proud words: Made in the U.S.A."

On Jan. 20, 2009, the day Obama was inaugurated, the federal government’s debt was $10.6T. After 3 years of Obama's spendapalooza without balancing the checkbook, in April of 2012 the debt was $15.6T, a 47% increase. This is amazing! All this time and no one has picked up on it. This explains everything. Yes - it's all so clear now. OBAMA CAN'T COUNT!! __________________________________________________________ Actually, most Democrats and even some Republicans (e.g., Bush) have this affliction too. The most prolific and latest example began with the 2006 election of kooks: From the first full quarter of the Pelosi-Reid controlled Congressional purse strings (2007) until President Obama assumed office (2009), government spending skyrocketed to 27.3% of GDP from 21.4%. It was the largest peacetime expansion of government spending in U.S. history.</Msg><Username>plmartintx12</Username><Timestamp>1347289417229</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 11:03:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347289485751-33</Id><Title>FLIP-FLOP ROMNEY WILL SOON ENDORSE PRES.

Intel slashes third quarter sales forecast despite Windows 8 launch CHIPMAKER Intel has revised down its earnings forecast for the third quarter to $13.2bn. On the eve of its Intel Developer Forum (IDF), Intel announced that it expects to make less money than it previously thought during its third quarter. The firm now forecasts revenues of $13.2bn, give or take $300m, down from previous estimates of between $13.8bn to $14.2bn. With Microsoft releasing Windows 8 to system builders this Autumn it was expected that the third quarter would be a very profitable one for Intel, as demand for its chips would increase as computer OEMs would build desktop and laptop PCs prior to the release of Windows 8. However Intel's comments suggest the opposite, with the firm claiming that supply chain inventory has been reduced, and lower than expected demand for PCs from enterprise and emerging markets has led it to revise down its earnings forecast.</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347304406274</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:13:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347305851012-45</Id><Topic><Title>Windoze 8 fails even before it hits the shelves</Title><Username>phands.theheretic3</Username><Timestamp>1347304406274</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:13:26 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iPad and iPhone are kicking butt with NO WinTel Inside!</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1347305851012</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:37:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347306024597-46</Id><Topic><Title>Romney said "I won't take God off of coins"</Title><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1347303529427</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 14:58:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama wants to change it to 'In Bernanke We Trust'.</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1347306024597</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:40:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347306083589-47</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY IS A FRAUD</Title><Username>c.luke44</Username><Timestamp>1347198687584</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 09:51:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>'Hope and Change' is a fraud!</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1347306083589</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 15:41:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347308792191-48</Id><Topic><Title>MITT ROMNEY IS A FRAUD</Title><Username>c.luke44</Username><Timestamp>1347198687584</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-09-09 09:51:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Democrat Trenton mayor, others arrested in corruption probe Published September 10, 2012 | Associated Press advertisement Federal agents arrested the mayor of New Jersey's capital city early Monday as part of an ongoing corruption investigation into bribery allegations related to a parking garage project that was concocted as part of an FBI sting operation. Trenton Mayor Tony Mack, his brother Ralphiel and convicted sex offender Joseph Giorgianni, a Mack supporter who owns a Trenton sandwich shop, were accused of conspiring to obstruct, delay and affect interstate commerce by extortion under color of official right. Federal prosecutors alleged Mack agreed to use his influence in connection with a proposed parking garage project in the city. The garage was made up -- a fake project created by investigators to try to capture Mack, who has financial problems and attracted legal scrutiny since he took office. Federal agents began investigating Mack and the others in September 2010. Mack had become mayor in July. The defendants received $54,000 and anticipated accepting another $65,000 from a cooperating witness who purported to be a developer, according to court documents that laid out the sting and the accusations of wrongdoing. The criminal complaint portrays Giorgianni as a boastful man who did most of the talking with two FBI informants -- one who was cooperating to get a better deal in his own criminal case, another who was paid. The sting was similar to the massive "Bid Rig" sting that resulted criminal charges against 46 people -- many of them local New Jersey officials -- in 2009. Then, bribes were attached to fictitious development projects. Prosecutors have had mixed success in winning convictions.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1347308792191</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-09-10 16:26:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347309459229-49</Id><Title>If Bing is better than Google, why the users are still using Google?</Title><Msg>If Bing is better than Google, why most of the users are still using Google?
