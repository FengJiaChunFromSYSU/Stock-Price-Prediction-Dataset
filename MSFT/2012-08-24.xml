Get ready for Windows 8 to be an even bigger Fiasco. To make things worse, Microsoft wants to end support for Windows 7 and XP, forcing people to buy Windows 8 computers. Guess what? Windows already lost 15% market share to Mac, Linux and non-WinTel mobile devices. I expect Microsoft will lose more 5% market share when they try to force Windows 8 on unsuspecting users.

The fact that he's still a Bain Capital executive and on their payroll, just as you've had to admit, that he's lied about that for at least ten years, and that he was a Bain Capital employee / owner all throughout his part-time half-term Governorship of the Commonwealth is exactly makes him unelectable and unfit for any office. Mitt paid ZERO Federal income and capital gains taxes for ten years straight using exactly the dodge he used with his "blind trust" and he never "retired" from Bain Capital, "retroactively" or otherwise. He's remained on the payroll and a business partner with an active conflict of interest against the public he continues to lie to in the process of his campaign to partly satisfy his limitless greed and ambition to gain power he hasn't any good intentions for.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345802132000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 05:55:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345803390000-7</Id><Title>It's not just that Mitt "learned"</Title><Msg>how to evade income taxes at Bain Capital that keeps him from being able to release his tax returns.

His prior years of returns show that he's been doing the same thing all the years he's alleging to have been "retired" and that he uses his political campaigns and positions of "public service" to gain insider information on likely targets for his LBO vulture business and to arrange contracts that drain off state and federal accounts into his pockets.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345803390000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 06:16:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345804148000-8</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;I didnt know you were clouseau&gt; You still don't.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345804148000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 06:29:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345805209000-9</Id><Topic><Title>It's not just that Mitt "learned"</Title><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345803390000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 06:16:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>for over ten years while saying that he's "retired". He's deliberately said that the value of the stock that ultimately vests into the pay is zero at the time of issuance of his pay in order to evade the 35% tax on income of the actual fair value of the underlying stock that will actually be the basis of the "partnership corporation's" restricted stock shares, even though he knows at the time of issue of the restricted stock exactly what stock the partnership will initially own and its actual fair market value. He's lying when he says he hasn't worked for Bain for thirteen years, since he's receiving active employment benefits, not living on retirement accounts. He's telling the truth when he says that his employment compensation is taken in options on Bain Capital stocks for a cost to Mitt of zero dollars. He's lying when he has Bard Malt declare the fair value" of the stock at the time it's issued to him on the condition that he remain a Bain Capital employee at zero dollars since he knows what company's stock is hoing to be hoovered up and stuffed into an offshore tax haven to play capital gain / loss games on. This is why it's hilarious to see him tell suckers who he'll screw silly if his Bain Capital leveraged buy-out of the United States succeeds how he "feels their pain" as small business owners or struggling middle class peons loaded down with debt that he profits from, or that he understands what it's like to struggle to meet a payroll and how he's burdened by taxes on his little Bain swindles.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345805209000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 06:46:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345805356000-10</Id><Title>A step too far</Title><Msg>Microsoft's impersonation of Big Brother? http://www.pcgamesn.com/article/why-i-m-uninstalling-windows-8 The reviewer puts it simply: Don't buy it!</Msg><Username>SterlingChap</Username><Timestamp>1345805356000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 06:49:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345805980000-11</Id><Topic><Title>Is Google the Real Tech King?</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345772965000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:49:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>M$ stopped being a tech leader well before vista.</Msg><Username>phands.the_heretic58</Username><Timestamp>1345805980000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 06:59:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345806081000-12</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>renaulfy??

August 24, 2012 | 1 comment | includes: DELL, HPQ, MSFT By Katey Stapleton Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) may not be able to sell Microsoft's (MSFT) new Windows 8 platform -- that is, if they don't have enough people to do so. The PC maker is expected to let go of employees much faster than previously anticipated, losing about 11,500 over the next month or so. A recent drop in PC consumer interest has troubled the likes of Dell (DELL) and Hewlett-Packard, which stated that it would cut about 27,000 employees by the end of fiscal 2014 in an effort to restructure the business. The company was originally set to dismiss 9,000 people this year alone, but it appears downsizing has been put on the fast track in order to turn business around. With layoffs and below consensus quarterly earnings polluting the industry, where does the PC drop leave Microsoft's impending operating system? With struggling Hewlett-Packard and Dell both set to introduce a slew of Windows 8-based products, the company may be fighting a losing battle against high-profile competition such as Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG). Luckily, interested consumers are not to fear - the Surface is here. From price points to the expected release date, Microsoft's first original tablet has generated a fair amount of hype that could ensure the success of Windows 8, overall. While quite the admittedly controversial piece of technology, the Surface interface could popularize the new software, leading to consumer loyalty and the purchase of more Windows 8-backed products.

Current law on carried interest is already a sweetheart tax deal for private equity, but why not make it better? Private equity folks are not the type to walk past a twenty-dollar bill lying on the sidewalk. In the 2000s it became common for private equity fund managers to “convert” their management fees into carried interest. There are many variations on the theme, but here’s how many deals worked: each year, before the annual management fee comes due, the fund manager waives the management fee in exchange for a priority allocation of future profits. There is minimal economic risk involved; as long as the fund, at some point, has a profitable quarter, the managers get paid. (If the managers don’t foresee any future profits, they won’t waive the fees, and they will take cash instead.) In exchange for a minimal amount of economic risk, the tax benefit is enormous: the compensation is transformed from ordinary income (taxed at 35%) into capital gain (taxed at 15%). Because the management fees for a large private equity fund can be ten or twenty million per year, the tax dodge can literally save millions in taxes every year. The problem is that it is not legal. Because the deals vary in their aggressiveness, there is some disagreement among practitioners about when it works and when it doesn’t. But in my opinion, and the opinion of many tax practitioners, the practices that were common in the private equity industry in the 2000s became very, very questionable, and it’s unlikely that they would have stood up in court." Mitt wasn't receiving fund distributions out of the Bain Capital Fund X limited partnership, he was participating as a manager in the Bain Capital Partners X LP and LLCs directly. That's why his management executive fees were taken as "earned income" and the 83(b) election was taken at a knowingly false zero "fair market" value to evade income taxes. Ann the "homemaker" will have her "blind trust" helpfully put the derivatives that mask the value of the underlying stock into the cookie jar (probably one of the ones that sit in a post office box in George Town) and repatriate a mix of capital gains and losses that pays for their extravagant lifestyle and zeros out their tax liability when Mitt isn't running for office, for Pete's sake. It isn't legal, but that was never a particular problem as far as Mitt was concerned; he learned from the best, he thinks.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345853707000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 20:15:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345853877000-93</Id><Topic><Title>Obama: Leader of the free world.</Title><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345851125000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 19:32:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://www.thepunch.com.au/images/uploads/KKKmain.gif</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345853877000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-24 20:17:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345854440000-94</Id><Title>Miff Romney Stoops To The Birther Level</Title><Msg>You can tell Miff is an empty suit with no intellectual amunition when he has to use the "birther issue" to bring his whackjob base aboard to his campaign.

Obama calls for the power to put civilians in prolonged preventative detention to prevent crimes the government knows they’ll commit in the future. Rachel Maddow tears apart Obama’s for call for the establishment of ‘a new legal regime’ that he claims is within ‘the rule of law.’ The new legal regime will give the government to declare certain people will one day commit a crime in the future and place them in prolonged preventative detention to prevent them from committing those crimes. Just watch as he argues We know that certain people will one day commit certain crimes. We need to establish a new legal regime to place these people in prolonged preventative detention so that they don’t commit those crimes. To be clear, Obama is calling for the government to be given the power to declare people will one day commit a crime and for the power to lock those people in jail – no lawyer, no charges, no trial- and just throw away the key to prevent them from one day committing those crimes in the future.
