No long term share holder of MSFT has suffered. Not with its steady dividend. You get what you pay for. You have a blue chip company with a growing div.

In the mean time, I have 3300 a month to invest in 401k. I have no doubt MSFT is about to become king again. And to be honest I'm just eyeing the dividend. I know there is a lot of naysayers about win8 but after I messed with a Surface last Friday I can say I'm totally impressed and see big things coming. Figure I can buy 100 shares a month guaranteed growing dividend. possible growth in the range of 20-30%. I'd be happy with a solid 3000 shares invested in MSFT as long term hold it and forget it investment. Reinvesting Divs... Cant complain about anything other than wishing I'd have bought earlier. Hopefully my other investment pays out soon and I can have 5000 MSFT shares. Nice little block of portfolio without much worry.</Msg><Username>dont_delay_indict_now</Username><Timestamp>1351657624556</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 00:27:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351658310352-3</Id><Topic><Title>Why a bidding war starts for Netflix below, 100-120 by friday out of aapl into NFLX cramer said sell aapl</Title><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1351645512736</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 21:05:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No bids on nflx when it was in the 50's, now out of thin air this thing's getting bid up into the 100's. Keep dreaming. I've yet to see any actual msft longs comment on this either. Its a ten billon dollar acquisition folks, when you take over a company you're responsible for the debt as well. I'm sure after however much they're paying pandora, they're not going to take on nflx too. They're not amazon, and offering free nflx for a year to any surface buyers would simply be way too costly.

Obeying duty at the expense of honour? How is letting your fellow American get killed when perhaps you had it within your abilities to go help them? There is no honour in this, the Seal may have disobeyed direct orders, but what he did was self sacraficing and there is no hire honour that one can demonstrate than to put themselves in harm's way even to the point they themselves could lose their lives, to help out a fellow American from losing theirs. And if you perform some due diligence, the military does have processes in place to follow in questioning when to disobey something they feel is unlawful and un-Constitutional. I suspect this Seal felt whatever orders he was given were unlawful and un-Constitutional and went to aid fellow Americans which is honourable and in the national security interest of this country, especially when the Ambassador, a direct representative of the President of the United States. For all intents and purposes, this Seal was going to protect the President. If the President has physically been in Libya and had been attacked, are you saying it would have been okay for a Navy Seal to say "Sorry Mr. President, you will have to fend for yourself, I have orders to "stand down. He may have disobeyed orders, but I think it was warranted and no doubt the President would have given him a Presidential pardon for saving the life of a direct representative of the President of the United States.</Msg><Username>skeetz1234</Username><Timestamp>1351697532542</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 11:32:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351697823998-53</Id><Topic><Title>SEAL Died Because He Disobeyed "Stand Down" Orders....</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1351647598253</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-30 21:39:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Sorry Mr. President, you will have to fend for yourself, I have orders to stand down".

"Our plan is to contact the Romney campaign and tell them there are issues" with the material, said Reid Magney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which supervises elections in the state and enforces state election laws. Magney said some of the training material -- obtained by the liberal Democratic blog Think Progress and posted on its website on Wednesday is either incomplete or misleading. The directive to observers, not to mention their connections to the Romney campaign, also conflicts with official Wisconsin Government Accountability Board guidance to all poll observers, publicly posted on the agency's website, instructing that they sign in and identify "the name of the organization or candidate the observer represents," he said."</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1351702425303</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 12:53:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351702463119-67</Id><Topic><Title>RWNJ deny climate change, how long you gonna believe them</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1351694119656</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 10:35:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"'There is nothing we can do about the climate that anyone is prepared to do.

It's not correct to say They were ordered to stand down. That doesn't quite cut it, because what that really means is they were told not to go help. They were told not to relieve the ambassador. They were told not to offer assistance. That's what they were told. They weren't told to stand down The above is from a news source, search for it. If your neighbors house is being attacked by terrorist and you are across the street and with a loaded m16 with a 100 round drum and someone tells you not to help you might tell them to suck your pie hold when you begin throwing lead.

Who won't the Kenyan throw under the bus and that's why the military had better be ready for his terrorist attack, on THEM. He pushed his mentor Reverend in front of a train while he was patting him on the back. He is deviously e vill and that's not a political statement, it's just a fact. He's lying in overdrive now and the American People know it. If he gets in it will be because no Americans show up at the polling booths. And that ain't gonna happen.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351737041601</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 22:30:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351738768385-129</Id><Topic><Title>The libs are always squawking about how more over regulation is needed to control every aspect of everything</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351730431971</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 20:40:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we libs are going to lock you up in one of Obamas FEMA camps and then we are going to deport you to Mogadishu</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351738768385</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 22:59:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351738961394-130</Id><Title>we libs are gonna get xkkkrushi8n deported to Mogadishu</Title><Msg>Mogadishu is the only place that xkkkrushi8n can be happy-- lots of guns, no taxes- no government either- just the thing for a criminally psychotic hater and basher who raves on the MSFT board day and night</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351738961394</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:02:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351739092558-131</Id><Topic><Title>Most of MSFT Win 8 sales were for $14.99</Title><Username>cspanosmwc</Username><Timestamp>1351700740246</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 12:25:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Then there is the activation key- can be sold seperatly- what does it cost</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351739092558</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:04:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351740093535-132</Id><Topic><Title>we libs are gonna get xkkkrushi8n deported to Mogadishu</Title><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351738961394</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:02:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Are your hot flashes getting closer?</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351740093535</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:21:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351740171475-133</Id><Topic><Title>The libs are always squawking about how more over regulation is needed to control every aspect of everything</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351730431971</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 20:40:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm going to step on you wee libs.</Msg><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351740171475</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:22:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351740599477-134</Id><Topic><Title>we libs are gonna get xkkkrushi8n deported to Mogadishu</Title><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351738961394</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-10-31 23:02:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hot flashes?? are hot flashes the root cause of your acute psychosis?
