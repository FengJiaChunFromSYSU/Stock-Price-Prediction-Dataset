Ballmer has presided over a huge drop in market capitalization. He brought you Vista, Zune, Bing and Kin. He lost Microsoft's dominance in web browser share and mobile phones. He brought you the first product called "Surface" which was a monstrosity, though at least the name made sense for it; then borrowed the name for a tablet, for which the name doesn't make sense. The other day I saw on TV a discussion of the contention between Apple and Google over online mapping services. Appropriately, there was no mention that Microsoft also has a mapping service. Ballmer is a loose cannon. Do you understand what that expression means? If not, look it up.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1351923703891</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 02:21:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351924108656-2</Id><Title>IT IS NO SHAME TO VOTE FOR ROMNEY.

Granted, most of the cash is overseas and they would be taxed the differential between countries if they repatriated the money. With interest rates so low why doesn't MSFT borrow billions to finance a dividend? They could borrow an awful lot at very low rates and still cover the interest with their incredible cash generation machine. Furthermore, if Obama wins the election MSFT might be "forced" to issue a special dividend if higher dividend taxes are expected. I'm sure Bill and Steve would rather pay a 15% tax rate vs. a 33+% tax rate? If Romney wins we could see incentives that allow corporations to repatirate at lower rates which could be an inducement for MSFT to increase their dividend significantly? Bottomline, MSFT can do a lot to unlock shareholder value in a very short period of time.</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1351951604517</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 10:06:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351951787701-14</Id><Topic><Title>Will The Right Wing Talking Teads Make a Retraction ???</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1351870181689</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 11:29:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did the CIA lie then, or were they called on the carpet to lie now?" quote from Grover paid Moe.

They needed a massive explosion, something that would erase President Obama's small but durable polling lead in most of the swing states. Instead, they got a dud. The numbers released this morning by the Bureau of Labor Statistics aren't particularly stellar - nothing new there - but they continue to confirm our upward trajectory. The economy added 171,000 jobs during October (most economists had anticipated 125,000); plus, the BLS revised the August and September numbers - upwards. Turns out, 192,000 jobs were created in August, not the initial estimate of 142,000. And September jobs have upticked to 148,000, frm the initial 114,000. Meanwhile, the latest jobless rate is 7.9 percent. That's one-tenth of a percent higher than in September, but, as business experts point out, that's because more people have re-entered the labor force - and when more people feel encouraged to look for work, that too is good news. Good news for the economy, that is. And good news for Obama. He's not likely to get a huge electoral boost from those numbers, nor would he have expected to. Most importantly, the final jobs report does him no harm.</Msg><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1351954863375</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 11:01:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351954907173-17</Id><Topic><Title>IT IS NO SHAME TO VOTE FOR ROMNEY.

In fact Bush's economy was propped up by the housing bubble which let families refinance their homes over and over as the value of their property falsely grew. This put spending power in to people's pockets to makeup for the short falls in hiring and wage growth under Bush. What bubble is Romeny cooking up? If Obama hadn't had as much stonewalling in congress who knows where we'd be at. Nobody ever gave obama a chance. Not even Obamacares was what he really wanted and it was the only real legislative victory he can claim. If republicans would have been more worried about fixing the economy instead of just figuring out how to defeat Obama over the past 4 years we MIGHT be in a better place today. No jobs bill which Obama wanted. No infrastructure spending which Obama wanted. Nothing.

And where are we today. My generation is now being asked to give back all the great tax "loop holes" that the baby boomers benefited from, such as child tax credit, mortgage tax credit etc. And we've got Romney Talking about reducing capital gains taxes. Yah? Easy for a guy who hasn't had any earned income in 20 years besides his governor pay check which was cheese compared to his investment income (which he doesn't pay SS on). Think baby boomers like Romney use the mortgage credit? Heck no, he pays cash. He doesn't have any children he can claim anymore, so of course he doesn't care about the child tax credit anymore. I'm sick of Baby Boomers. They bankrupted SS by borrowing from it. We wouldn't have a SS crisis if we had saved that money for its intended purpose. And I'm not being partisan about that either, #$%$ all baby boomers. They have borrowed and borrowed us in to debt and just like was said in the 80's, they are just going to die while WE pay their SS retirement, and we have no SS retirement to look forward to or fall back on. If you are a 60 year old making 1,000,000 in the market. Yah, its time for all the benefits you raped from us over the decades to come back to the American people that didn't create the problems our country is in right now. I didn't say it was ok to borrow from SS to pay for programs. That wasn't my decision. but now I'm being asked to carry the burden. I'm 100% for the "death tax"... one hundred f@cking percent. In fact it should be taxed at 90% over $1,000,000. They reaped all the benefits and now they are the ones passing that burden on to ME.</Msg><Username>a_conservative_hates_america</Username><Timestamp>1351984493848</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 19:14:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351984553418-51</Id><Topic><Title>Obama slips, reveals his inner feelings of hate,: Voting for him is "revenge?"..against whom?</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1351910225156</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-02 22:37:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tries to scare people into voting for him and simpers like a baby when he's called on it.

The families of three Americans killed in the Sept. 11 U.S. consulate attack in Benghazi, Libya, are offering widely different reactions to recent reports that U.S. personnel issued several requests for help that were turned down. Patricia Smith, the mother of slain State Department employee Sean Patrick Smith, is now blaming President Barack Obama for her son’s death. “I believe that Obama murdered my son,” she said Thursday from the living room of her Clairemont home. “I firmly believe this.” Patricia Smith, who voted for Obama in 2008 at the insistence of her son, said reporting by Fox News is the basis for much of her belief that Obama is ultimately responsible for her son’s death. She said Sean, who went to Mission Bay High School but lived abroad, was a fervent supporter of the president. Smith’s view echoes that of Charles Woods, father of Tyrone Woods, the 41-year-old former Navy SEAL from Imperial Beach who died fighting in Benghazi. Charles Woods appeared on Fox News shows over the weekend to denounce decisions made by U.S. officials during the Libya attack. “I’m a retired attorney, and I know that these actions legally do not constitute murder. But in my mind the people in the White House, all of them who have authority to send in reinforcements to prevent what they knew was going to be the death of my son, are guilty of murdering my son,” Woods said Sunday on Fox’s Sean Hannity show. The older brother of Glen Doherty, a former Navy SEAL from Encinitas working as a U.S. security contractor, said Doherty and Tyrone Woods were part of the force that responded to the consulate attack. “They rescued a bunch of people and brought them to the (consulate) annex, and then people defended the annex after Glen and Ty fell. All those people didn’t get overrun and wiped out. They had enough people to fight off that battle,” said Greg Doherty, who lives in Kensington in Northern California. In that light, Doherty said the debate over needing more help doesn’t make sense to him, unless it might have been U.S. airstrikes against a mortar position used by attackers. “But then you are getting into real specific strategy, and I don’t think it is civilians’ job to pick apart an actual battle and talk strategy, unless you are a general,” said Doherty, reached by telephone Thursday. “It just seems like people are looking to direct their anger at Obama somehow.” The debate about how the administration handled security for the Libya consulate is heating up in the week before the presidential election. Despite that, Charles Woods, reached by U-T San Diego Thursday afternoon, said, “I don’t want this to become political and become dishonoring to Ty.” He declined to answer any further questions. The extended Navy SEAL community around San Diego is talking about the details of the Libya attacks.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1351993522699</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 21:45:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351993977785-75</Id><Topic><Title>IT IS NO SHAME TO VOTE FOR ROMNEY.

HOUSTON, TX - Friday afternoon at an early polling place located at 6719 W. Montgomery Road in Houston, NAACP members were seen advocating for President Barack Obama according to volunteer poll watchers on location at the time. According to Eve Rockford, a poll watcher trained by voter integrity group True the Vote, three NAACP members showed up to the 139 precinct location with 50 cases of bottled water and began handing bottles out to people standing in line. While wearing NAACP labeled clothing, members were "stirring the crowd" and talking to voters about flying to Ohio to promote President Barack Obama. After watching what was occurring, Rockford approached Polling Supervisor Rose Cochran about what she was seeing. "I went to the polling supervisor and let her know that it was not appropriate that they were in the building handing out water. She ignored me. I repeated my statement. She told me that she would handle it. She did nothing. I then went to the assistant supervisor and he stood up, walked over to another table and then sat down. I then walked into the waiting room and they were reloading another dolly with more cases of water," Rockford said in a True the Vote incident report. After handing out water and advocating for President Obama, the NAACP members started handpicking and moving people to the front of a long voting line inside the polling place according to the incident report. After multiple complaints from voters about the line cutting, Rockford received a phone call from downtown telling her to “stand down.” “All of the sudden one of the clerks, Dayan Cohen, said that someone wanted to speak to me on the phone. It was someone from downtown. I got on the phone and she said she was from downtown and that I needed to stand down and that it was okay for the NAACP to be within 100 ft. and they could hand out water. I told her that the NAACP was inside the building, wearing the NAACP clothing and caps and were handing out water and moving people from the back of the lines to the front of the lines,” Rockford said. At this point, NAACP members were instructed to turn their clothing inside out, which they refused to do and said they weren’t going to stop their actions inside the polling place. Their behavior and actions to move people to the front of the line continued for the rest of the evening. Texas State Representative Sylvester Turner, a former Texas NAACP leader, was also seen outside the building talking with voters. “The NAACP basically ran this poll location and the judges did nothing about it,” Rockford said.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1351994386900</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-11-03 21:59:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351995580083-79</Id><Topic><Title>IT IS NO SHAME TO VOTE FOR ROMNEY.
