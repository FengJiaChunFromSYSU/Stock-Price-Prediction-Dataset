But weekly jobless claims sank to a two-month low, in a hopeful sign for the labor market. Ros Roberts | Getty Images New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods in August fell by the most in 3 1/2 years, pointing to a sharp slowdown in factory activity even as a gauge of planned business spending rebounded. The Commerce Department said on Thursday durable goods orders dived 13.2 percent, the largest drop since January 2009, when the economy was in the throes of a recession. Orders for July were revised down to show a 3.3 percent increase instead of the previously reported 4.1 percent gain. Economists polled by Reuters had expected orders for durable goods — items from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last at least three years — to fall 5 percent. Last month, the drop in orders reflected weak aircraft and automobiles demand. Boeing [BA 70.2834 0.9034 (+1.3%) ] received only one aircraft order in August, down from 260 in July, according to information posted on the plane maker's website. Transportation equipment tumbled 34.9 percent after racing ahead 13.1 percent in July. Excluding transportation, orders fell 1.6 percent after dropping 1.3 percent the prior month. Economists had expected this category to rise 0.3 percent after a previously reported 0.6 percent fall.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348753142092</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:39:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348753606963-15</Id><Topic><Title>Yet Another Rightwing Conspiracy Theory On The Polls.

This new list is a far cry from the more than 2,600 registered voters that state election officials once targeted -- but Republican Gov. Rick Scott and others have defended the continued effort. "I have not talked to one Floridian who says I want my vote diluted by somebody who has never had a right to vote in my state," Scott said last week. "We are doing absolutely the right thing. We believe in honest and fair elections." It's not clear, however, if the latest effort by the state will result in voters being removed from the rolls prior to this year's presidential election. Florida is a key swing state, and voting rights groups have criticized the purge as a way of discouraging legal immigrants and minorities from casting ballots. Under the process that election supervisors will use, they will send out letters to those suspected of being non-citizens. In some cases it could take up to 60 days before the voters are eventually removed from the rolls. "It's going to take a while," said Susan Bucher, the Palm Beach County elections supervisor, who was sent the names of 14 voters suspected of being ineligible. "It lands us after Election Day."</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348753811612</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 09:50:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348754227006-18</Id><Topic><Title>....Intel (INTC) Issues Statement on Unsubstantiated News Reports</Title><Username>buffet_graham</Username><Timestamp>1348693989768</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 17:13:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see the wally bot is still around.

Unless you think allowing the wealthiest to save a few percent on their tax is more important than let the country fail. I view the main problem is china has cleaned our clock in manufacturing, and all thanks goes to corporate greed and the Job Creators. Obama is working on that.

I think we don't know where things came from, and it is beyond our capabilities. If we evolved like other animals, they have limits like a dog with a calculator, no amount of playing with and chewing the calculator will ever make him know what it's for. Why are we so arrogant to think we have no limits like that. Possibly God gave us the otherwise unneeded spark of mind to think of things like God. We can come pretty close to understanding what it is all from, but can't get there, without the so called imaginary "leap of faith.". When I hear people say a theory to where water came from is meteorites, it isn't believable as where did the meteorite get it's water, it isn't really a theory of anything, just nuts and bolts. I made a leap of faith about 18 years ago fronm a non religious upbringing and stance. I think Obama speaks of something he did similarly and he grew up in a non religious household.

The Congressional Research Service says tax rates for those with the highest incomes "are currently at their lowest levels since the end of the second World War." And the share of the income earned by the top 0.1% of families is more than double their share in 1945---9.2% during the 2007-2009 recession, though lower than 12.3% just before the recession hit, according to the latest data from the Congressional Research Service.

I think they do a descent job on the enterprise front.. but on the personal front everything has been going downhill in the past 10 years, and I am really worried for the future.</Msg><Username>xavc1980</Username><Timestamp>1348776314219</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 16:05:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348776402431-65</Id><Topic><Title>Romney says he Harvests Companies....</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1348774053442</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 15:27:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>while throwing away employees like chaff.</Msg><Username>mbislying</Username><Timestamp>1348776402431</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 16:06:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348777249482-66</Id><Topic><Title>Romney says he Harvests Companies....</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1348774053442</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 15:27:33 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney has nothing to do with policy that has this country in recession.

The study, by two UCLA researchers, found that female politicians with what are described as stereotypically feminine features tended to be Republicans, and the reverse was also true for Democratic women. GOP women rated, on average, twice as stereotypically feminine as Democrats. In fact, the authors said the correlation was so strong that undergraduates were regularly able to guess someone's party affiliation just by the way she looked. "I suppose we could call it the 'Michele Bachmann effect,'" said Kerri Johnson, an assistant professor at UCLA and the study's senior author, said in a statement announcing the research — a reference to the well-known GOP congresswoman from Minnesota.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348777413170</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 16:23:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348777538428-70</Id><Topic><Title>Why is it so difficult for some to see something so clear?</Title><Username>plmartin_2012</Username><Timestamp>1348177804899</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 17:50:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>faeces I see no country giving up their pensions, health programs, military etc- why dont you name one- what it means is financing of the programs faces huge resistance from the super rich and radical right and wind up being under financed.

The move came after the Palm Beach County, Fla., elections supervisor discovered 108 potentially fraudulent registration forms submitted by the GOP consulting firm, including suspected phony signatures and home addresses that matched those of a gas station, a medical building and a Land Rover dealership. NBC News has learned that two other Florida counties, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa, have also reported possible fraudulent registration forms submitted by the firm, including apparent dead people being registered as new voters. Prosecutors in two counties are investigating possible voter fraud by the GOP consulting firm, officials said. ************************************************************ THE RNC CUT TIES WITH THAT FIRM ONLY AFTER THEY GOT CAUGHT!!!</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1348782108091</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-27 17:41:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348782360515-82</Id><Title>"Make no mistake...", the dead have as much right to vote as the living.
