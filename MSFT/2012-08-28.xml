How did, specifically, Obama do this? Start with Jan 2009 as that is when you start ro blame him. Percentages on welfare are more realistic as of course the population is growing. Please cite the reference for your "facts." I doubt any answer will be coming. The way I see it in a non political fashion, is he did a lot to turn the boat around but was stopped by the tea party congress. You see, they only want him not in there, no matter the damage to the people.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1346128681240</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 00:38:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346150460676-2</Id><Topic><Title>Poll: Romney faces headwinds in race against Obama</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1346122849350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 23:00:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No doubt there are strong headwinds for a Romney win. Romney will be lucky to get 5% of the black vote (at least in polls). For the superficial observer Obama is more likeable. Obama being the incumbent should be an overwhelming advantage. Actually if Obama were even moderately competent, we would not be talking polls and a few points. Her'e my guess, if Romney is trailing by less than the margin of error, he wins. A few blacks will peel off, though they dare not say it out loud in a poll. A few young people will peel off, some actually want a better job environment. A few whites who have the idea people will think them racist if they publicly oppose a black President who has failed will peel off, and most importantly some people who verbally support Obama will not bother to vote. The latest poll as to motivation factor shows Romney supporters with about a 10 point enthuiasm margin, another area it wouldn't be close if Obama were competent.</Msg><Username>havvcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1346150460676</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 06:41:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346153800950-3</Id><Topic><Title>Teachers=Liberals=Progressives=Garbage</Title><Username>dogeater2012</Username><Timestamp>1346131089509</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 01:18:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>=Communism.</Msg><Username>ref_steve_blairstown</Username><Timestamp>1346153800950</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 07:36:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346160804214-4</Id><Title>Board has gone to the dogs</Title><Msg>This board is being monopolized by something calling itself "dogeater".

Ronald Reagan remains the modern Republican Party’s most durable hero. His memory will be hailed as The Great Uncompromiser by those who insist the GOP must never flag in its support for smaller government, lower taxes and conservative social values. His record tells a different story. During Reagan’s eight years in the White House, the federal payroll grew by more than 300,000 workers. Although he was a net tax cutter who slashed individual income-tax rates, Reagan raised taxes about a dozen times. His rhetoric matched that of many of today’s most ardent Christian conservatives, yet he proved to be a reluctant warrior on abortion and other social issues. bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-28/hero-reagan-s-compromise-would-collide-with-tea-party-certitude.html Reagan couldn't get nominated in todays whacjobGOPTeabagging Party.</Msg><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1346170385806</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 12:13:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346170800576-24</Id><Topic><Title>Board has gone to the dogs</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1346160804214</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 09:33:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Question is, how do such posts benefit Microsoft?

If a customer wants to use MSFT product on any CSP other than Azure, they have to buy a full license. This doesn't make sense. I can use a MSDN license on a virtual server in my own data center, but if I install it on a virtual server of the SAME EXACT CAPACITY on a CSP, this is not allowed. I am still using the license to develop code that a customer will need to purchase a full license to run in production.</Msg><Username>jlambethcissp</Username><Timestamp>1346181884287</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 15:24:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346182134298-39</Id><Topic><Title>Middle class</Title><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1346069384905</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-27 08:09:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>More are dying in foreign wars during the Obama term than in 8 years of Bush.

Wealthy donors and corporations are more heavily invested in this presidential election than at any time since the 1972 Watergate scandal led to stricter campaign- finance laws. A series of court decisions and regulatory changes in 2010 unraveled federal limits on donations, paving the way for a return of the big players. They are pooling their money in nonprofits, which keep contributor names secret, and super- political action committees, which amassed $350 million through the end of July. Romney is more than just a political kindred spirit; he’s a sound investment. Here’s how a Romney presidency might pay off -- literally -- for some of these super-donors. .bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-29/donors-invest-millions-in-romney-for-billions-in-returns.html ROMNEY IS OWNED AND PAID FOR!</Msg><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1346200365741</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 20:32:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346202319555-62</Id><Title>Obama gave billions of YOUR money for millions in donations</Title><Msg>So what would you rather have, people spending their own money, or Obama giving yours away for payback?</Msg><Username>havvcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1346202319555</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 21:05:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346204229263-63</Id><Topic><Title>Anyone else think CNBC's, Brian Sullivan is Obnoxious ?</Title><Username>rbh411</Username><Timestamp>1346191662361</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-28 18:07:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would rather look at a hot chick!..
