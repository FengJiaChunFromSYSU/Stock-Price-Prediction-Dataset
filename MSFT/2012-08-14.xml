It appears the barbarians are at the gates, and the sack of Rome is imminent. Microsoft would be circling the wagons if Bill Gates were still running things, but he isn't. Sorry for mixing metaphors. Cue the wally bot telling us that the XBox can't be beat, and CNN is a gang of Microsoft haters. Geez, if everybody wally called a Microsoft hater really was, nobody would ever have heard of Microsoft. http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/14/ouya/?source=yahoo_quote The $99 box that wants to crush the Xbox August 14, 2012: 5:00 AM ET The designers of the Ouya game console set out to raise $900,000 on Kickstarter. Instead they brought in over $8 million -- and became the most talked about device maker in tech. By Peter Suciu, contributor FORTUNE -- It could be the ultimate high score. Hardware start-up Ouya began a Kickstarter campaign earlier this year hoping to raise $950,000. In the end, it generated enough excitement to bring in more than $8.5 million. The Los Angeles, California-based startup with the funny sounding, vowel-laden name aims to upend the traditional console gaming market by selling a low-cost gaming system. Based on Google's (GOOG) Android operating system, the system will feature a quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB internal flash storage, HDMI and Wifi connections as well as a wireless controller. Ouya won't be in the business of selling discs -- unlike Microsoft (MSFT), Nintendo (NTDOY) and Sony (SNE). Instead, the company will adopt the app store model that has made Apple's (AAPL) products into a gaming phenomenon. Ouya's backers -- of which there are currently 63,416 -- certainly think the idea has merit. The newly funded company announced that it is on track to deliver the console in March of next year. "The idea of starting a new hardware platform via Kickstarter is definitely a new idea and we are impressed with the final $8.5 million tally," says George Chronis, analyst with DFC Intelligence. "Normally we would dismiss such console products automatically as just another attack on windmills."</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1344953939000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 10:18:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344954392000-14</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan Killed 2010 Bowles-Simpson</Title><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1344914504000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:21:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A weinermobile driver?</Msg><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1344954392000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 10:26:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344954547000-15</Id><Topic><Title>Paul Ryan Killed 2010 Bowles-Simpson</Title><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1344914504000</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-08-13 23:21:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No one should be above listening to all of what President, yes President, Obama says.

He's not. Romney *is*. "Consider what the Romney campaign, then, is saying: If Romney is elected, then by his third year in office, every single federal program that is not Medicare, Social Security, or defense, will be cut, on average, by 40 percent. That means Medicaid, infrastructure, education, food safety, road safety, the postal service, basic research, foreign aid, housing subsidies, food stamps — all of it has to be cut by, on average, 40 percent. If Romney tried to protect any particular priority, it would mean all the others have to be cut by more than 40 percent. That’s not even remotely plausible. The consequences would be catastrophic. The outcry would be deafening. And Romney has shown no stomach for selling such severe cuts. Consider that, even as we speak, Romney is running away from the unpopular bits of the Ryan budget, which delivers far less devastating cuts than what Romney is promising. Does anyone really believe that he will take office and then propose cuts that make the Ryan budget look soft on federal spending? That he will take office and, after running away from specifics during the campaign, propose what would surely be the most unpopular budget in American history? And does anyone believe that the real Romney is the guy who made these outlandish budget promises in order to win a Republican primary, rather than the guy who is disavowing Ryan’s Medicare cuts mere days after naming him to the ticket? This is simply not a credible budget plan, and Romney’s fast retreat from Ryan’s most unpopular cuts makes it even less credible. And yet Romney, who has never released the specific cuts that would make his numbers add up, repeatedly touts it on the campaign trail, and the media dutifully reports his promises to cut federal spending by more than $500 billion in 2016, and in fact to balance the budget by the end of his second term, which would require far larger cuts than what I’ve outlined here, despite the fact that everyone basically knows these cuts aren’t credible and will never happen." http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/14/romneys-budget-plan-is-a-fantasy/ The GOP is in utter disarray and you are fawning over a "personality"? Obsequious twit. Ryan's "power" in what will be a largely ceremonial set of duties consisting of presiding over the senate and occasionally casting a tie breaking vote in that body or the odd diplomatic jaunt is NIL. Unless something changes drastically in the next couple of months this ticket is likely unelectable.</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1344962483000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 12:41:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344962803000-28</Id><Topic><Title>How much does Skype add revenue?</Title><Username>samuelsonfriedman</Username><Timestamp>1344960102000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 12:01:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well. Skype was about to make a loss just before M$ bought them... http://maxnosleeves.tumblr.com/post/27507447555/microsoft-buys-skype-changes-internal-network-to-make &gt;&gt; Government agencies trying to spy on calls were frustrated with both the Skype network and the fact that Skype wouldn’t release its encryption codes (being a European company, it wasn’t required to). In 2009, NSA quietly offered a reward of “billions” for any firm that could offer reliable eavesdropping on Skype. In 2011, Microsoft bought Skype for $8.5 BILLION, which was surprising financially since Skype had a $7M operating loss the year before, was $686M in debt and was valued by analysts at around $3-4 billion. Moreover, Microsoft’s Windows Live Messenger was basically providing the same service as Skype, and was about 3 times as popular. Microsoft then went about changing the internal Skype network, re-engineering the supernodes and re-routing the calls through monitored servers. The end result was a VoIP call that was easy to track, trace, and listen in on – even more so now that Microsoft, a Washington-based company, has the encryption codes. The bottom line? If you’re using Skype, you might as well assume that the NSA, the agency accused of keeping a secret dossier on every US citizen, is listening in. &lt;&lt; Given M$'s utter uselessness with acquisitions, I can't imagine that Skype has miraculously turned around since the buy-out. But since the real aim of the buy-out was to make Skype easier to eavesdrop on for the NSA, it's probably moot.</Msg><Username>paulh.heretic</Username><Timestamp>1344962803000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 12:46:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344963594000-29</Id><Topic><Title>I can't lose</Title><Username>donavonsvg534</Username><Timestamp>1344951853000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 09:44:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IGNORE - SPAMMER MALWARE VIRUS LINKS</Msg><Username>killspam13</Username><Timestamp>1344963594000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 12:59:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344963655000-30</Id><Topic><Title>Technical Chart Shows Upside on Microsoft Corporation</Title><Username>samueltorp</Username><Timestamp>1344956017000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 10:53:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IGNORE - SPAMMER MALWARE VIRUS LINKS</Msg><Username>killspam13</Username><Timestamp>1344963655000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 13:00:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344965305000-31</Id><Topic><Title>Its a major Setup!

We simply are not 'there yet'. So we won't give up our immature wasteful lifestyles but there might yet be another way. Treaties among countries regarding population reduction. Nobody sacrifices directly, the compliance is easy to measure, the effect is certain to fix the problem. If we all (countries) commit to population reduction targets ( from reduced births) then our civilization has a chance. It is also soooooo easy to implement, just more of the same that we have been doing all along, birth control, planned parenthood, subsidies for contraceptives, and even tax breaks for families that comply. It really is the only solution that is remotely workable and has the side effect of increasing the standard of living for the reduced population.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1344990420000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 20:27:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344992577000-66</Id><Topic><Title>"This Guy (Paul Ryan) is Amazing!"</Title><Username>plmartin_2012</Username><Timestamp>1344960267000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 12:04:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He has a BA and no advanced economics education, wiki is our friend.

ZIPPO! It does have to do with CO2 dissolving in the oceans and turning the oceans into ecological disasters. See T.E.D. Talks: Ancient Clues Episode 8 - Peter Ward on Earth's Mass Extinctions Claims that CO2 in oceans somewhere between 300 and 1000 PPM will unleash hydrogen sulfide (H2S) bacteria that will lead to a mass extinction of higher life on this planet. We are already at about 350 PPM CO2 in ocean. Episode 9 - Ron Dunbar, Discovering Ancient Climates in Oceans and Ice Claims that CO2 in oceans now in excess of 350 PPM is causing acidification in oceans that is impairing carbonate organism (chorals, clams anything with a calcium carbonate shells or structures) because the acidic water dissolves the calcium carbonate. We have already "overshot" the safe limit for the oceans and need to do something drastic to restore the oceans.</Msg><Username>azhdarchid.quetzalcoatlus</Username><Timestamp>1344997938000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 22:32:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344997982000-71</Id><Topic><Title>If Romney/Ryan wins ...</Title><Username>jcbrowns</Username><Timestamp>1344993640000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 21:20:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obamanure!</Msg><Username>obadidos1</Username><Timestamp>1344997982000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 22:33:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344998015000-72</Id><Topic><Title>The only real solution to MMGW</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1344990420000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 20:27:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>anyone advocating that the Earth has a normal temperature is without doubt an ignorant religious puppet.

It's already being done in China and has reduced population growth there at a horrid cost to human rights. Many Chinese wish to escape China and go some where else where they are permitted more than one child per family. "If we all (countries) commit to population reduction targets ( from reduced births) then our civilization has a chance. It is also soooooo easy to implement, just more of the same that we have been doing all along, birth control, planned parenthood, subsidies for contraceptives, and even tax breaks for families that comply." This is all from the Progressive Movement &amp; Eugenics Movement of the 1930's that lead to the Holocaust and genocide in Germany a few years later!</Msg><Username>azhdarchid.quetzalcoatlus</Username><Timestamp>1344998527000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 22:42:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344998724000-75</Id><Topic><Title>FASTER GAMING WITH LINUX THAN WINDOZE !!</Title><Username>henkepek</Username><Timestamp>1343911836000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:50:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wow, Linux and iPad are more popular on this message board than Windows 8.</Msg><Username>b52boomer</Username><Timestamp>1344998724000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 22:45:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344998878000-76</Id><Title>Metro</Title><Msg>Does anybody like the new 'Metro' graphical interface with Windows 8?
