He won despite the great majority opposing the "Affordable Health Care Act". If you view people's opinions of his policies, the non spun fact is he won in spite of most of them, not because of them." Perhaps the GOP favored pollsters that came up with that nonsense regarding what "a great majority of the population think", should either change their polling techniques, or alternatively, change who they're talking to. The fact is that Mr. Obama won not only the electoral vote but the popular vote as well. What that would tell most reasonable people, (this excludes you by default), is that the pollsters failed to talk to enough of the huge number of those that the GOP, via Tea Party activists, attempted to legislatively disenfranchise and exclude from voter rolls since 2010 by making it harder for them to vote and hysterically screaming about non existent "voter fraud". You, of course, enthusiastically slurped down their Kool-Aid without a second thought because for all your posturing and your big mouth, you are absolutely devoid of any ability to think critically.

Yes, for consumption IN CHINA, not for IMPORTATION to our shores. This is is something that most of the major auto builders do to cut cost by eliminating huge shipping and handling costs, duties, etc. Most foreign auto builders that sell into the U.S. also manufacture IN THE U.S. utilizing U.S. WORKERS, providing increased employment and saving both consumers and builders a great deal of money. Darn pesky facts indeed, ghos. "Search for the Bloomberg article. It ends with news/2012-10-21/fiat-says-china-may-build-all-jeep-models-as-suv-demand-climbs dot h t m l " I think that the executive officers that have repudiated that line of bull just MIGHT have a better idea of what the forward looking plans of the corporation are than anyone working for or at Bloomberg. Don't you...? "Jeep Production Isn’t Moving to China, Chrysler Chief Says By JEREMY W. PETERS AND JIM RUTENBERG Chrysler’s chief executive on Tuesday strongly refuted claims that production of Jeeps would shift to China, an insistence that cast further doubt on the Romney campaign’s recent efforts to undercut President Obama’s support for the auto industry as it fights for Ohio’s 18 electoral votes. In an e-mail to employees, the chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said that Jeep’s commitment to the United States was unequivocal. “I feel obliged to unambiguously restate our position: Jeep production will not be moved from the United States to China,” he wrote. “It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.” Mr. Marchionne’s response — an unusually forceful gesture from the chief executive of a major American corporation a week before Election Day — came as the politics of the auto bailout took center stage in the presidential campaign. The Romney campaign has come under considerable criticism in recent days for taking liberties with the facts in a new television commercial that suggests Jeep, a recipient of federal bailout money, will soon outsource American jobs to China. Chrysler, Jeep’s parent company, does not in fact have plans to cut its American work force but is considering opening a facility in China where it would produce Jeeps for sale locally."

That statement from the CEO of the parent pretty much overrides and negates what a division executive says, wouldn't you think? Can you think, troll boy? You're a useless troll, creek.

Well then, be prepared for the first woman president next time. Hillary Clinton. She has expanded her experience from the practice of law, to First Lady, to Senator from NY, to Secretary of State of the United States. Her political philosophy is aligned with precisely that which America just voted back into office, both popularly and electorally . It is doubtful that the GOP will take charge of their ranks and move back to a more centrist, moderate position of compromise in the best interests of the republic. It is doubtful that the GOP will put adequate distance between themselves and the Tea Party extremists that have infiltrated their ranks and co opted their platform, to offset the effects of this nation's rapidly shifting demographic, one that increasingly repudiates the Tea Party philosophy and goals. Rush Limbaugh's inane rants not withstanding... It is doubtful that GOP movers and shakers such as Mitch McConnell will refocus on what is good for the country as opposed to continuing to proceed with racist, misogynistic, anti youth attacks on the fastest growing segments of our population. Singling out a sitting POTUS in a constant, vitriolic and bellicose fashion does nothing to help further your case with the voting public. It is doubtful that the increasingly myopic GOP will make the connection between assisted (not subsidized) higher education that produces skillful citizens that in turn assure the continued or regained preeminence of America's high tech based workforce, and the continued existence of our generally high standard of living and relatively dominant economic posture in the 21st century world.

In the report, a source from inside the White House reveals that the attack, which occurred at the compound housing American diplomats on the event of 9/11 and resulted in the death of four Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens, was a botched attempt at an "October surprise" to bolster the President's failing poll numbers. According to the published report, in the weeks leading up to the attack, Barack Obama, in alliance with leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood, arranged what was supposed to be the kidnapping of Ambassador Stevens, who would later be released in exchange for the release of Omar Abdel Rahman, also known as the "Blind Sheik", who is regarded as one of the world's leading terrorists. Rhaman, who is blind as a result of diabetes, is currently being held at the U.S. Bureau of Prisons located in North Carolina. The trade was to be done as a means of improving the president's image as a leader and thus boosting his chances of re-election.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1352477093507</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 11:04:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352477119532-40</Id><Topic><Title>The Real Reason Romney Lost</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1352429661602</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-08 21:54:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Yes, for consumption IN CHINA, not for IMPORTATION to our shores.

Is it really, ghos? "Summary The exaggerated Republican claim that the new health care law “kills jobs” was high on our list of the “Whoppers of 2011.” But the facts haven’t stopped Republicans and their allies from making the “job-killing” claim a major theme of their campaign 2012 TV ads: Five ads by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce attack Democrats by repeating the “Obamacare will kill jobs” refrain. Seven other Chamber spots praise Republicans, using the same theme. An ad from the group Freedom Path, supporting Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, says the law is “devastating to small business.” Republican Rep. Jo Bonner of Alabama features a large stack of papers he claims are “job-killing regulations and taxes” in one of his spots. All of this is health-care hooey, aimed at exploiting public concern over continuing high unemployment, with little basis in fact. As we’ve said before (a few times), experts project that the law will cause a small loss of low-wage jobs — and also some gains in better-paid jobs in the health care and insurance industries. It’s also expected that more workers will decide to retire earlier, or work fewer hours, when they no longer need employer-sponsored insurance and can obtain it on their own with help from federal subsidies. But that just means fewer people willing to work — and it will free up jobs for those who want them. If anything, that could reduce the jobless rate. Claims about the alleged devastation of small business are also off base. The fact is, businesses with fewer than 50 workers are exempt from the requirement to provide coverage, or pay a penalty to the government. Furthermore, some small businesses with fewer than 25 employees are already getting tax credits under the new law to help defray the cost of providing worker coverage. The GOP ads tend to combine the mostly bogus “job-killing” claim with their well-worn slogan calling the law a “government takeover” of health care, which isn’t true. The law expands the government’s Medicaid system to cover some who are not currently insured, but it also greatly expands private insurance. After the law takes effect, the government’s share of all spending on health care will still remain well under half, rising less than 4 percentage points, according to official projections. Read on to our Analysis for more on the law’s projected impact on jobs."

Really, ghos? You're basing unsubstantiated assertions of supposed "fact" regarding reactions to federal law on hearsay? Hearsay, ghos? You're better than that. " Too bad this thing was jammed through under cover of night, rather than fully deliberated and revised before being passed, because we do need some changes. This monstrosity just ain't it." OK, lets say that is largely true. Are you saying that the law can not be amended to be improved? Don't we as a nation send our elected representatives to do just that all the time and haven't we done that for several hundred years now with great success? Hearsay? Really? How about well researched, verifiable FACTS, ghos? "Claims about the alleged devastation of small business are also off base. The fact is, businesses with fewer than 50 workers are exempt from the requirement to provide coverage, or pay a penalty to the government. Furthermore, some small businesses with fewer than 25 employees are already getting tax credits under the new law to help defray the cost of providing worker coverage. The GOP ads tend to combine the mostly bogus “job-killing” claim with their well-worn slogan calling the law a “government takeover” of health care, which isn’t true. The law expands the government’s Medicaid system to cover some who are not currently insured, but it also greatly expands private insurance. After the law takes effect, the government’s share of all spending on health care will still remain well under half, rising less than 4 percentage points, according to official projections."</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1352486097906</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 13:34:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352486568371-65</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Won Because....</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1352477003948</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 11:03:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What is straight on abortion?</Msg><Username>einho330</Username><Timestamp>1352486568371</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 13:42:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352487133002-66</Id><Topic><Title>Just came out of the lunch room where liberal women are expounding...</Title><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1352480937545</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 12:08:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>OK.

In the consumer world, these trends are already wreaking havoc. But what does the meteoric rise of mobile mean for the enterprise world? It can be summarized in one word: Deconstruction. Enterprise systems have evolved over the course of decades. One can only imagine the complexity of some of the older enterprise systems. With less real estate and often less bandwidth to work with, mobile tends not to reward feature complexity. Meaning, systems that were once defined (and valued) by their features and complexity, will soon need to become the opposite; suites of lightweight, mobile first apps that work together to accomplish the task at hand.

More than half of Republicans say wealthier Americans should pay more in taxes to bring down the federal budget deficit. Fifty-three percent of self-identified Republicans back an increase in taxes on households making more than $250,000, a sentiment at odds with the party’s presidential candidates, who will meet tonight in a Bloomberg-Washington Post-sponsored debate focused on economic issues. Oct. 11 (Bloomberg) -- More than two-thirds of Americans, including a majority of Republicans, say wealthier people should pay more in taxes to bring down the budget deficit, and even larger numbers think Medicare and Social Security benefits should be left alone. More than 8 out of 10 Americans say the middle class will have to make financial sacrifices to cut the federal deficit even as the public just as strongly opposes higher taxes on middle-income families, according to a Bloomberg-Washington Post national poll conducted Oct. 6-9.

To force small business to reduce payroll? To use the increases to run the government for only a few weeks? If so, then what? Tax increases must be supplemented with drastic cuts in govenment's wasteful spending. Whatever the answer, it better come quickly otherwise those who have their savings and retirement funding tied to the stock markets (pension plans, IRAs, 401Ks, Educational savings plans, etc. will take enormous hits as the markets will tank another 15% or even worse. Consumer spending will be ground to a halt, more will lose their jobs, thus putting a further strain on entitlements, Either a deal can be made or we are done.

Bush administration, has committed the unthinkable – he’s called out his own party for outright lying about taxes. In the Economix column published in today’s New York Times, Bartlett writes- “ Historically, the term “tax rate” has meant the average or effective tax rate — that is, taxes as a share of income. The broadest measure of the tax rate is total federal revenues divided by the gross domestic product. By this measure, federal taxes are at their lowest level in more than 60 years. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that federal taxes would consume just 14.8 percent of G.D.P. this year. The last year in which revenues were lower was 1950 according to the Office of Management and Budget. Bartlett continues by explaining that the postwar annual average is about 18.5 percent of G.D.P. while revenues averaged 18.2 percent of G.D.P. during Ronald Reagan’s administration, at one point getting as low as 17.3 percent of G.D.P. in 1984.</Msg><Username>your_lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1352508520463</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 19:48:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352508758119-106</Id><Topic><Title>Saint General Petraeus' "little David"...</Title><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1352507008895</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-09 19:23:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Too bad.
