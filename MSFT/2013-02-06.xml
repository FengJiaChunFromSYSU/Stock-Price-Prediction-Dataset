Since that's the current driver, it might be expected MS would extend support for Win 7 beyond the current Jan 2020. But most companies keep a computer for about seven years so the last date to buy Win 7 is right now. Next, there is a widely held theory of three mobile phone platforms. The top two are, of course, iOS and Android. So the fight for Number 3 is Blackberry verus Windows 8 Phone. Meanwhile, both Android and Tizen will run on an Intel mobile phone processor as well as on ARM processors. But there isn't a version of Windows 8 Phone for an Intel mobile phone processor. Then there is the game console X-Box. It's very interesting in the market share and position that the X-Box reached. However, we may be looking at legislation against violent video games and marketing to parents against violent video games. To develop popular video games that don't emphasize violence would mean the need to find a different type of video game developer. The current video game developers aren't going to have any ideas but what they already do. Meanwhile, I think the consumer PC market is waiting for the correct form factors to develop. Both Samsung and Lenovo have some interesting ideas and offerings. Then Dell decides to submerge but can certainly copy the form factors of others. HP doesn't seem to have laptops as good as the Samsung Series 9 but they have a new tablet, the Elite Pad 900 with some sales wins.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1360190336517</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 17:38:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360190691819-60</Id><Title>Number of PC's in a hospital</Title><Msg>In the hospital where I work, PC's were introduced 7 years ago, to store medical data. Within the last one year, nurses and technicians were required to record all their measurements in portable PC's on wheeled carts. I wondered how many PC's were in my hospital.... There are 350 beds, an ICU, a CCU, an ER, and a business and accounting office. The software used for medical records is from Juniper Networks, and also Meditech software and Citrix. There are 4 stories, and the top three stories each contain 2 nursing stations. There are 4 corridors, radiating like spokes, from each nursing station. in each corridor, at any time, one can observe employees such as RN's and respiratory technicians logging data onto the portable PC's. There are about 8 PC's in any given corridor, or about 32 per nursing station, and about 16 within the nursing stations on each wing. On the top 3 hospital floors, there are about 96 computers per floor (2x48), roughly 300 total. In the ER, there are computers for the doctors, the nurses, and the intake clerks. I estimate 10 computers for the intake clerks, 6 for the ER doctors, and about 12 at the nursing station, and about 20 in the corridors, or 48 total. Also 48 in the CCU. Also, In the ICU. The total computers for the nursing and physician area is about 550, summing these totals. In the x-ray department, and in the laboratory, there are at least 50 computers each place. In the billing department, and in the accounting office, there are an unknown quantity of computers (top secret area)! I would estimate there are 1000 PC's in my 350-bed hospital, and they all use Windows XP, because that's the program that's compatible with the Juniper Networks and Meditech software we use. In each physician's office, there is at least one XP computer which can talk to the hospital. There are 300 physicians on staff. ...continued ....</Msg><Username>puzzled48</Username><Timestamp>1360190691819</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 17:44:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360190777293-61</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro: Another Skunk</Title><Username>sillymuppets</Username><Timestamp>1360168670136</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 11:37:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An abnormal obsession with Powerpoint.

Also, my hospital is expanding from a 4-story facility to a 6-story facility, by building an entirely new hospital next door. It will use both buildings (10 stories altogether). I assume the number of computers, will expand proportionally. Eventually, the 1000 computers in the hospital, and the 300 in the physicians offices, will need to be upgraded to Windows 7. (Windows XP support from Microsoft stops soon). Eventually, tne number of Windows upgrades will double or triple, as employees mo've to the larger facility, with the more numerous PC's. It is easy to imagine that computers may be placed right in the patient rooms, instead of remaining on wheeled carts in the hallways.

MSFT still owns the OS market and now has all the growth opportunity it has laced for years with Dell in its pocket to make the hardware that HP does eating into the desktop marketshare (it's not going away folks), Nokia in its pocket to make the Windows phone to eat into the smartphone marketshare, Surface Pro with MS Word, MS Excell and Powerpoint making it an Ipad that actually can do the work of a PC/laptop, and MS is expanding into Africa big time. All of the above spells growth. Where can Apple grow? Where can Google grow? It's all NEW revenue streams to MSFT. Buy while you can. I am.

You'll distort and misinterpret anything to say something bad about the Pres. Death is sad, it was a terrible thing, but you weren't nearly as concerned when the boy Martin was killed, nearly the same age. Unfortunately, when al awlaki made his life work death to America, he started something. You seem to be siding with an enemy. If they stop hating America we won't have to use our force to prevent more attacks like 9/11. Maybe you want another 9/11. When you say Obama killed the boy, the way you say it is just wrong. It wasn't done on purpose or planned by Obama, there is a lot of difference. When you are President, you can allow al quaeda to grow and flourish, assuring more attacks on America. You do realize they want to set off nucear bombs in our cities, don't you? They are trying day and night to do that, and this al awlaki was one of the heads of that. Go ahead, be for them, as long as you can come up with another anti Obama episode.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1360204743536</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 21:39:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360205747035-80</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro Reviews Are Overwhelmingly Negative</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1360170724953</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 12:12:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Reviews that compare the Surface Pro to the iPad are superficial. The Surface Pro is a PC that will run Photoshop, TurboTax, and so on. The iPad is a device that essentially uses the mobile-web system. And very few applications are allowed to install on the iPad. Instead the iPad must go to a website for an application run. The Surface Pro is certainly headed towards Intel Haswell for battery life improvement. Or it might drop Ivy Bridge completely and go to quad-core Atom in 2014.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1360205747035</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-06 21:55:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360210602764-81</Id><Title>Let's face it.
