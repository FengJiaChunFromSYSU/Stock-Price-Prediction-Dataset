The year before, he made $21.6 million, paid $3 million in taxes and gave $3 million to charity. So, to recap: Mitt Romney has, in the past two years, paid almost $5 million in taxes while giving away $7 million. And, as he said, he has paid the taxes he was supposed to pay according to the laws of the United States, which is all that is required — legally, morally and practically — of anyone. If you’ve been reading my columns for the past couple of years, you know I’m perfectly capable of being critical of Romney. I did so the other day, and radio host Mark Levin called me a “trash-mouther” who was “giving aid and comfort to Obama.” With open arms: Mitt Romney has given $7 million to charity the last two years, while paying $5 million in taxes. AP With open arms: Mitt Romney has given $7 million to charity the last two years, while paying $5 million in taxes. But the release of these tax records leaves no doubt about one thing: Mitt Romney is an extraordinarily, remarkably, astonishingly generous man. A good man. Maybe even a great man. That is all. There is no “but.” Anyone who says otherwise is ignorant, stupid or a liar. It’s important to talk about how charitable deductions work, because there is great confusion about them and their effect on the amount people pay in tax as a result. You will hear it said, by people who are either ignorant or have an axe to grind, that the charitable deduction is a tax shelter. It is anything but. Shelters are investments that work to protect money from being taxed by the government. In effect, every dollar in them is put there either so that it can earn money or so that it can be used to lower a person’s tax burden. Now consider the dollar given to charity. If you’re Mitt Romney, your dollar would be taxed at a rate of 35 percent by the federal government — the highest rate. When you give that dollar to charity, you are, in effect, excused from paying 35 cents of it to the government. But here’s the key: You don’t get the other 65 cents back. If you simply kept that dollar for yourself and paid tax on it, you’d still have 65 cents of it in the bank. By giving that dollar away to charity, you lose that 65 cents entirely. It goes to the charity, as does the 35 cents you’d have paid to the IRS. It’s likely, given these numbers, that over the past 20 years the Romneys have donated more than $50 million to charity. Do the math: Under current tax law, if he’d kept the money, he’d have $30 million more than he has now. (That’s extremely inexact, but you get the idea.)</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348322820458</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:07:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348323896460-13</Id><Topic><Title>Be wary</Title><Username>tocrazyright</Username><Timestamp>1348064777914</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-19 10:26:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AMC Deplores The Attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon (WASHINGTON, DC - 9/11/2001) The American Muslim Council (AMC) strongly condemns this morning's plane attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and expresses deep sorrow for Americans that were injured and killed.

No one will pay that much for M$ junk. ^^^^ PC makers usually don't cough up pricing information on unreleased models easily, but apparently the folks at wpcentral merely asked Lenovo reps at a recent press event how much the ThinkPad Tablet 2 running Windows 8 Pro would cost at launch -- and the reps told them. The new slate will bow on October 26 -- the launch date of Windows 8 -- and cost $799. That price will apparently include a keyboard, which could make it a slightly better deal than Microsoft's own Surface Pro tablet, which may cost $799 with an additional $199 for its keyboard cover. (You may also be able to buy the ThinkPad Tablet 2 without the keyboard, presumably for $100 to $200 less.) But it's also in line with Microsoft's assertion that Windows 8 Pro tablets will compete in price more with ultrabooks than with consumer tablets. ^^^^</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348337339164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 14:08:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348338252195-19</Id><Topic><Title>Romney and Obama tied at 46% with 5% undecided</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1348324591825</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:36:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ignore idiot</Msg><Username>mishaelena</Username><Timestamp>1348338252195</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 14:24:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348338382892-20</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 with Win 8, keyboard will cost $799</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348337339164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 14:08:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So don't concern yourself with MSFT products that are clearly over your head anyway &amp; don't buy them you trolling putz.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1348338382892</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 14:26:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348340253392-21</Id><Topic><Title>Romney and Obama tied at 46% with 5% undecided</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1348324591825</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 10:36:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Romney will lose----most americans are smarter than you think--romney better buy a tanning salon----for that look</Msg><Username>a.hudkins</Username><Timestamp>1348340253392</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 14:57:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348344402868-22</Id><Topic><Title>ROMNEY CALLS AMERICANS LOSERS ALL 47%+;</Title><Username>c.luke44</Username><Timestamp>1348331280851</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 12:28:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You got it right he said exactly that meaning, losers who want everything "food,housing, ..you name it" he said, "for free" he said. .

So he can say he didn't lie, but he will file an amended after he loses the election. Gets around the lie where no one will know. It doesn't matter if he paid more tax than the guy who is a janitor at the school. It's the rate that's important. Gates pays more than romney that doesn't give him extra citizenship, unless you aren't living in America. It may be hard for you to understand what rate means Romney said his charitable contribs are to be secret, his faith doesn't allow, what happened, he lose his Faith?

Being Green Checking out at the store, the young cashier suggested to the older woman, that she should bring her own grocery bags because plastic bags weren't good for the environment. The woman apologized and explained, "We didn't have this green thing back in my earlier days." The young clerk responded, "That's our problem today. Your generation did not care enough to save our environment for future generations." She was right -- our generation didn't have the green thing in its day. Back then, we returned milk bottles, soda bottles and beer bottles to the store. The store sent them back to the plant to be washed and sterilized and refilled, so it could use the same bottles over and over. So they really were truely recycled. But we didn't have the green thing back in our day. Grocery stores bagged our groceries in brown paper bags, that we reused for numerous things, most memorable besides household garbage bags, was the use of brown paper bags as book covers for our schoolbooks. This was to ensure that public property, (the books provided for our use by the school) was not defaced by our scribblings. Then we were able to personalize our books on the brown paper bags. But too bad we didn't do the green thing back then. We walked up stairs, because we didn't have an escalator in every store and office building. We walked to the grocery store and didn't climb into a 300-horsepower machine every time we had to go two blocks. But she was right. We didn't have the green thing in our day. Back then, we washed the baby's diapers because we didn't have the throwaway kind. We dried clothes on a line, not in an energy-gobbling machine burning up 220 volts -- wind and solar power really did dry our clothes back in our early days. Kids got hand-me-down clothes from their brothers or sisters, not always brand-new clothing. But that young lady is right; we didn't have the green thing back in our day. Back then, we had one TV, or radio, in the house -- not a TV in every room. And the TV had a small screen the size of a handkerchief (remember them?), not a screen the size of the state of Montana. In the kitchen, we blended and stirred by hand because we didn't have electric machines to do everything for us. When we packaged a fragile item to send in the mail, we used wadded up old newspapers to cushion it, not Styrofoam or plastic bubble wrap. Back then, we didn't fire up an engine and burn gasoline just to cut the lawn. We used a push mower that ran on human power. We exercised by working so we didn't need to go to a health club to run on treadmills that operate on electricity. But she's right; we didn't have the green thing back then. We drank from a fountain when we were thirsty instead of using a cup or a plastic bottle every time we had a drink of water. We refilled writing pens with ink instead of buying a new pen, and we replaced the razor blades in a razor instead of throwing away the whole razor just because the blade got dull. But we didn't have the green thing back then. Back then, people took the streetcar or a bus and kids rode their bikes to school or walked instead of turning their moms into a 24-hour taxi service. We had one electrical outlet in a room, not an entire bank of sockets to power a dozen appliances. And we didn't need a computerized gadget to receive a signal beamed from satellites 23,000 miles out in space in order to find the nearest burger joint. But isn't it sad the current generation laments how wasteful we old folks were just because we didn't have the green thing back then? Please forward this on to another selfish old person who needs a lesson in conservation from a young person.</Msg><Username>farml1234</Username><Timestamp>1348369670886</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 23:07:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348370524664-45</Id><Topic><Title>Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 with Win 8, keyboard will cost $799</Title><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1348337339164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 14:08:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2 with Win 8 keyboard will cost $799 and will outsell the Ultrabook-- cheaper W-8 machines will dominate the market to a share somewhere over 90% and crush the iturds and suxturds - it will be just like the current desk top triumph for Microsoft</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1348370524664</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 23:22:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348371696784-46</Id><Title>He will an echo, a reverberation</Title><Msg>and an encryption to snatch at for some time.</Msg><Username>planchette_vette</Username><Timestamp>1348371696784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 23:41:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348371848849-47</Id><Topic><Title>He will an echo, a reverberation</Title><Username>planchette_vette</Username><Timestamp>1348371696784</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 23:41:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I meant he will leave...an echo etc. The reverberation must build up over the years for very old people, like rings.</Msg><Username>sidewire_of_agalaxy</Username><Timestamp>1348371848849</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-09-22 23:44:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
