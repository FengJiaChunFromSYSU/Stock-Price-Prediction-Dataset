It's a cooperative synergistic relationship. The broker needs a commodity to sell, the producer needs a broker to move the commodity he has produced into channels of distribution so the product doesn't rot in the field or the silo re your example. Your thinking is still one dimensional as is your vision. Fanaticism, extremism and dogma have a tendency to do that to a person.

Of course every occupation has specific training. This is not relevant at all. Is it not obvious to you that people differ in their capabilities some being more capable than others. Not everybody can be a computer programmer but most could be a farmer with sufficient 'education'. It is precisely this scarcity of innate ability that determines wages and earnings. I shouldn't have to explain this to a conservative. Yes i dodged the question about fundamental needs to survival because it is irrelevant. You see we have this thing called money and it acts as a motivator for people to enter any profession that has a scarcity. Using naive logic the same argument can be made that 'garbage collectors' are just as vital to a society as farmers because we could not live in our own garbage. But wait you will say if some don't collect garbage others will, same with farmers. True value in the new economy is being able to do conceptually difficult things.

A century ago before the rise and preeminence of "agribusiness" in our food supply chain, the producers of perishable food stuffs were local. Now they are global. In that bygone era, the broker had no role at all because produce was localized in terms of cultivation, distribution (farmers' markets and self/family peddled) and consumption. This is no longer the case and the commodity brokers' importance as a cog in the modern machine that is "agribusiness" can no longer be minimized. Once again, think 21st century. You can NOT turn back the clock to suit your archaic philosophy regarding good governance in the interest of ALL the people.

"Reagan played to the crowds during speeches and was the first president to use his television appearances to his utmost advantage. His political presence was unlike anything Americans had encountered before. Much of that presence was the result of Nancy Reagan's endeavors to glamorize the First Family. Mrs. Reagan had never fallen out of love with the dazzle, glitz, and elegance of the Hollywood lifestyle she and her husband had abandoned in the 1960s. Because she found the White House décor somewhat drab, she spent hundreds of thousands of dollars revamping and redecorating the White House to make it more of a palace than a presidential mansion. Nancy threw many extravagant parties and invited all their old friends. Actor Jimmy Stewart, for example, visited occasionally. With so many famous people visiting the Reagan's, the White House quickly became the center of the social scene in Washington D.C. Not since the days of John F. Kennedy had the White House been such a lively place."</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1352315348707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:09:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1352315700253-86</Id><Topic><Title>Mooche's Vacation Schedule</Title><Username>hcram906130</Username><Timestamp>1352311478288</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 13:04:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, Idiot.

According to White House chief usher Rex Scouten, she took an intense interest in every detail of every state dinner, from the food and flowers to the seating and entertainment. She increased the number of state dinners to nearly one a month, and cut back the guest lists from 130 to 96 so that they would feel more like private parties. “The Reagans had such ease as hosts,” Brandon adds. “Mrs. Reagan always said to me, ‘Muffie, these parties have to be fun.’”</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1352315700253</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-07 14:15:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352315821894-87</Id><Title>Did you notice the diversity of the crowds in Chicago vs Romney's crowd?</Title><Msg>Young, old, white, black, hispanic, asian, gay, straight, male, female faces in Chicago.
