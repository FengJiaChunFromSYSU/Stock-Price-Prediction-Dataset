In 2011, Goldman Sachs calculated Microsoft would earn about $444 million in Android licensing during 2012. Last year, analysis firm Trefis estimated Microsoft pulled in over $790 million on Android royalties during one quarter of 2012 just from HTC and Samsung. Those figures are probably conservative. If Microsoft earns an average of $8 per device, that figure jumps to $3.4 billion just for 2013 — still assuming Microsoft gets royalties on only half of Android devices sold worldwide. Microsoft already claims more, and additional licensees would make the percentage larger. By 2017, with the same assumptions, the figure could be almost $5.9 billion. If Microsoft collected royalties on 75 percent of Android devices sold, by 2017 that could be worth over $8.8 billion. Will Microsoft use try to use its patents to try to crush Android? It seems unlikely — if Microsoft were going to deny licenses to major Android players, it would have done so by now. On the contrary: Android seems to be offering hundreds of millions — maybe billions — of reasons Microsoft would want Android to succeed. Bing it.</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1367408871964</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 07:47:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367409241619-17</Id><Topic><Title>Is Obama ultimately responsible for the Boston bombings?</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367402471293</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 06:01:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>back to online fukery again hawcreek??</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1367409241619</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 07:54:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367409337448-18</Id><Topic><Title>Whatever Happend to "cfury", "phands", "lugubrious" and the Rest of the old gang of Crazy Leftists?</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1367374482329</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 22:14:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Well the current batch of RWNJ posts are just soooo below the threshold of response all there is to do is label them online fukery.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1367409337448</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 07:55:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367409488050-19</Id><Topic><Title>Whatever Happend to "cfury", "phands", "lugubrious" and the Rest of the old gang of Crazy Leftists?</Title><Username>kinderjimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1367374482329</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 22:14:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Whatever Happend to..."

Time has come for Android to join the pages of history as Windows 8 Phone would more than outdo Android.... However Apps developers are angry as it would cut into their business and force them to comply with MSFT standards and that is where a lot of this noise is coming from.... The developers need to get on side and develop more Apps for Windows 8 and that seems to be happening with the reputable developers.... Samsung is a key player on the Phone side, however Nokia Windows 8 Phone was voted the Mobile Phone of the year and as the market awareness increases Windows 8 will handily beat Android..... AS for the Revenues, MSFT will triple its take vs what it makes from licensing Android technology.

Nokia Lumia 920 quickly became a massive hit, and more successful than many people had expected. It took less than a month for the Lumia 920 to sell its first 2.5 million units, and the handset remains one of the most in demand models on the market. In the weeks and months following its launch, there were several reports from retailers and networks in a number of countries that demand for the phone was so high that stocks are quickly selling out, with Nokia’s factories struggling to produce enough phones to fulfil orders. Alongside its commercial success, the Nokia Lumia 920 has received widespread praise from critics and rave reviews from customers. In fact, the Lumia 920 has already won several awards for its innovative features, design and hardware. The handset has recently picked up another award, having been crowned ‘Smartphone of the Year’ in the Engadget Awards 2012. While this is an impressive achievement in itself, what’s interesting is that the Lumia 920 won by a very wide margin, with 43.7% of votes from the poll carried out by Engadget readers. As you may have expected, the Samsung Galaxy S3 and the Apple iPhone 5 came in at number two and three respectively, but the Galaxy S3 only clocked up 15.6% of votes, while 13.4% of Engadget readers thought the iPhone 5 was the best smartphone of 2012.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367414290006</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:18:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367414652843-29</Id><Topic><Title>Is Obama ultimately responsible for the Boston bombings?</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367402471293</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 06:01:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Jr didint have prior knowledge of 9-11...But Darth Cheney did..first VP in history in charge of Norad....lied to Minetta, got huge profits from Haliburton....Was in on PNAC ...etc etc.....</Msg><Username>generaljackripper</Username><Timestamp>1367414652843</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:24:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367414923889-30</Id><Title>MSFT earnings growth next two quarters....</Title><Msg>Folks here is where the action is as in this Quarter our earnings will grow by 13.5% and next a whopping 28.3% YoY....

Two months from now, revised government estimates are likely to show that the economy is even bigger than the currently stated $15 trillion. And while the numbers may make some blink or gasp, the mere size of gross domestic product won't hide the reality that in terms of actual growth, this is also the worst economy in 83 years. GDP growth is in the midst of its longest sub-3 percent annual growth rate since 1929, the beginning of the Great Depression, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The economy hasn't topped 3 percent since 2005—before Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke took over—and is unlikely to do so this year. So even if projections are correct that the economy is about 3 percent bigger than thought—say, another half-trillion dollars—the U.S. is still stuck in the slow-growth morass it has endured since the beginning of the Great Recession. Nowhere is that more apparent than in employment. Though employment has risen by 1.3 million over the past year, unemployment that counts the discouraged and underemployed, as well as the jobless (often called the "real" unemployment rate) has remained stubbornly high, at 13.8 percent of the workforce, according to the most recent count. In fact, a state-by-state look at the numbers, released a few days ago and current through the first quarter, shows that just six states have real rates below 10 percent.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1367416731488</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 09:58:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367416895810-39</Id><Topic><Title>Obama.

The IDC PC shipment report had led to dumping of "PC stocks" as PC sales declined by a greater than expected 14% in Q1 2013. Microsoft has not really set the world on fire with its new product launches. The Surface RT tablet has pretty much been given up for dead with Nvidia CEO citing the absence of Outlook as one of the reasons for the low sales. After the end of the promotional pricing period, Windows 8 sales have been lackluster and Microsoft has been forced to reduce the prices of some key new products to boost sales. Despite the bad news, MSFT stock has climbed up and crossed the crucial $30 level. The recent stock surge was attributed to a $2 billion stake taken by a value oriented hedge fund. http://seekingalpha.com/article/1388301-why-microsoft-stock-is-going-up-despite-windows-8-going-down?source=yahoo JB.</Msg><Username>jbspectrum</Username><Timestamp>1367419495791</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:44:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367419816032-51</Id><Title>Why did the Obama administration go on TV</Title><Msg>... with pictures of the Islamic extremist Boston bombers they had to get from the public, AND then turning around and asking the public: duh, urr...does innyone know who these two fellas is?... duhrrr, uh thanks. Not only had Russian intelligence already provided the U.S. with a file on the nutty elder bomber, Saudi intelligence is now reporting that they also warned us about him. The Saudi's sent a written warning about Tsarnaev and three Pakistani jihadis to Homeland Security in 2012, which was very specific and warned that something was going to happen in a major U.S. city. In addition, based on security concerns, the Saudi government denied an entry visa to the extremist elder Tsarnaev brother in December 2011, when he hoped to make a pilgrimage to Mecca. Actually the answer to the question why is simple. Just like the economy, this administration of incompetent liberal radicals has no idea what it's doing with regard to, and quite frankly doesn't give a ratsass about foreign affairs and national defense.</Msg><Username>plmartintexas2012</Username><Timestamp>1367419816032</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:50:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367420014272-52</Id><Topic><Title>Momos raising the price...</Title><Username>jbspectrum</Username><Timestamp>1366816716596</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 11:18:36 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Insiders jump ship....who is going to hold the bad...? gl, JB.</Msg><Username>jbspectrum</Username><Timestamp>1367420014272</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 10:53:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367420137030-53</Id><Topic><Title>Some dummy shorted 3 million shares a few minutes ago....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367347165678</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-30 14:39:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Except our earnings grew 20% last quarter, and for the next two will grow 13.5 and 28.3% plus....

It’s the most familiar couplet ever uttered on Wall Street and, by this point of the year, the most overused: “Sell in May and go away.” The reason this has become such a clichéd pearl of purported wisdom is that there’s a grain of truth within. That, and it’s catchier than, “Historically, most stock-market appreciation has occurred from November through April, and while it doesn’t work every year, and May through October is not down on average since 1928, its average gain is weak and those months have featured a greater incidence of nasty declines.” Of course, the fact that the simplistic sell-in-May approach has worked pretty well the past three years – and that the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index rose six straight months by more than 13% since Oct. 31 to a new high – has only heightened awareness of it. The month of May alone in the past three years has brought S&amp;P 500 losses between 1.9% and 7.9%, and in each case ushered in a stretch of choppier market action and further declines into mid-summer. gl, JB.</Msg><Username>jbspectrum</Username><Timestamp>1367430492070</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:48:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367430526133-87</Id><Title>Don't you just love how MSFT insiders PUMP it UP and THEN dump a ton of stock MSFT going lower back to $28 like always</Title><Msg>Don't you just love how MSFT insiders PUMP it UP and THEN dump a ton of stock MSFT going lower back to $28 like always</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367430526133</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:48:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367430603504-88</Id><Topic><Title>WOW its not just Bill selling everyone at MSFT is selling shares , DUMPING, DUMPING and DUMPING more shares</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367429345251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:29:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INSIDERS are DUMPING and that is the facts</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367430603504</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:50:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367431083411-89</Id><Topic><Title>WOW its not just Bill selling everyone at MSFT is selling shares , DUMPING, DUMPING and DUMPING more shares</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1367429345251</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:29:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Really, really old news.

The trip is billed as "an important opportunity to reinforce the deep cultural, familial, and economic ties that so many Americans share with Mexico and Central America." And at yesterday’s White House press conference, the president stated that he is "very much looking forward to taking the trip down to Mexico" this week. But the trip won’t exactly be cheap for taxpayers, assuming the costs mirror those incurred by the American taxpayers for President Obama's last trip to Mexico, for the G-20 summit in June 2012. According to recently discovered documents relating to the costs of that trip, taxpayers paid nearly $2.5 million for hotel and “vehicle rental.” The first government document is a contract with a travel agent for the hotels required for the president's delegation and entourage for the conference:</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1367432147007</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:15:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367432255790-97</Id><Topic><Title>State sponsored terrorism: Tamerlan Tsarnaev and family got about $100,000 support from U.S. government</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1367402161831</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 05:56:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, idiot, we told you he was wrong downplaying Islamic terror before this.

Apparently Mohoro will be a way to use the Windows desktop in a software-as-a-service way, dubbed "desktop as a service." That means instead of having Windows installed on the PC or tablet, the device would grab Windows and apps from the Internet and beam it to your device. We don't know the details about Mohoro, or even when Microsoft will publicly talk about it. But generally speaking, desktop-as-a-service means that employees can use any device, even an iPad or Mac, to run Windows and Windows apps in a window or browser. Employers like it because it makes PCs easier to manage. Instead of dealing with individual PCs, they can secure data, update software, revoke access when an employee leaves, all from their data centers. Desktop-as-a-service isn't a new concept. Microsoft has been working with partner Citrix for years. Other vendors include Desktone, VMware, Wipro. But Microsoft does not allow partners to offer a full version of Windows 7 as a service. We expect to hear more about it next month at Microsoft's annual developer's conference, Build.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367433902331</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:45:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367434092483-108</Id><Topic><Title>Skype will make MSFT the largest telecom on Earth</Title><Username>matterofmoney</Username><Timestamp>1367140051224</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 05:07:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>allthingsdPOINTcom/20130501/firm-targets-skype-in-patent-lawsuit/</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367434092483</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:48:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367434122961-109</Id><Topic><Title>Slow Windows 8 adoption continues to haunt Microsoft</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367430457379</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:47:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Does your mother know you're playing with her computer?</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367434122961</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:48:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367434180895-110</Id><Title>Windows 8.1 / Blue Build Reveals Internet Explorer 11 Improvements....</Title><Msg>Microsoft is making the final adjustments to Windows 8.1 as we speak, with a new leaked build showing a couple of improvements specifically aimed at developers. According to a report published by The Verge, Internet Explorer 11 is very likely to pack some new options supposed to help devs work with the built-in apps, even though it’s not yet clear whether the company plans to keep them in the stable version of the operating system or not. Aside from the obvious speed and performance improvements, IE11 might also include tab syncing options to allow users to restore the browsing session on another Windows 8.1 device. There’s no official confirmation on Internet Explorer 11, but the leaked builds indicated that the Windows 8 upgrade is likely to pack the final version of the browser and not a preview release as it was initially rumored.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367434180895</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:49:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367434182944-111</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft 'Mohoro' Could Be A Whole New Way To Use Windows....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367433902331</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:45:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you think they get patent on cloud-mainframe soon? :-D</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367434182944</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:49:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367434333006-112</Id><Topic><Title>Slow Windows 8 adoption continues to haunt Microsoft</Title><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1367430457379</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 13:47:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>mrs. bates? she not mind. she happy to sit in rocker and look out over motel.</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367434333006</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:52:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367434657871-113</Id><Topic><Title>Windows 8.1 / Blue Build Reveals Internet Explorer 11 Improvements....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367434180895</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 14:49:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IE?

Microsoft's filing, with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) here, appears designed to at the very least streamline the process of making a move and - at most - make switch over automatic. The company describes an architecture that involves executor, detection, organizer, and summary components that will received and verify notices that a cloud service is to be terminated, find the relevant data and service, prioritize the data or service, and give a summary. According to the filing, Microsoft's technology will preserve the data, meta-data, or service that's being terminated, roll it back to a state that allows migration, find a similar service comparable to the one already use, and then provide the migration. The filing comes amid growing debate about the need for portability of applications and data between different online service providers offerings, and the need to prevent lock in.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367436468908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:27:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367436695140-128</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft has filed a patent to lock-down a method for moving data between different "clouds."....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367436468908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:27:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>AS I wrote before, we will own the Cloud business and some....

Last week, they ignored the pleas of Newtown families and the siege of violence in Boston and yielded once again to the fanatical rants of Wayne LaPierre and the National Rifle Association. In just the first three months of this year, as it shoved back against the renewed push for controls, the NRA spent a record $800,000 keeping congressional members in line. And how else to explain why corporate tax breaks have more than doubled in the last 25 years? Or why the Senate and House recently gutted the STOCK Act requiring disclosure of financial transactions by White House staff and members of Congress and their staffs and prohibiting them from insider trading? It was passed into law and signed by President Obama last year – an election year – with great self-congratulation from all involved. But fears allegedly arose that there might be security risks for some in the executive branch if their financial business was known. That concern was examined by the Columbia Journalism Review, which “consulted four cybersecurity experts from leading think tanks and private security consultancies. Each came to the same conclusion: that Congress’s rationale for scrapping the financial disclosure rules was bogus.” Nonetheless, the House and Senate leapt at the opportunity to eviscerate key sections of the STOCK Act when almost no one was watching.</Msg><Username>punch_the_hippie</Username><Timestamp>1367442001677</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 17:00:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367442383057-150</Id><Title>Got a Windows XP end-of-life plan?

AAPL -0.79% are bringing the smartphone wars to the Pentagon. The Department of Defense is expected in coming weeks to grant two separate, security approvals for Samsung's Galaxy smartphones, along with iPhones and iPads running Apple's latest operating system, according to people familiar with the matter—moves that would boost the number of U.S. government agencies allowed to use those devices. Both companies have been pushing hard to win over U.S. defense agencies, some of the government's most security-conscious customers. That market is small and still largely dominated by Research In Motion Ltd.'s BBRY -3.01% BlackBerrys, so the new security approvals won't likely translate into any immediate, big sales or new customers. Still, the approvals are among a handful considered to be the gold standard in communications security. Passing muster at the Pentagon can go a long way in making other security-minded customers—like bankers and lawyers—feel more comfortable using the devices."</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367445757041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 18:02:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367445903335-160</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft has filed a patent to lock-down a method for moving data between different "clouds."....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367436468908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 15:27:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YES all Cloud folks should be worried as they will be at the Mercy of Mr. Softy for Royaltie$$$$$....

(AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) The move may pose a threat to BlackBerry (BBRY)’s dominance at the Pentagon, which has more than 450,000 of the company’s devices. BlackBerry has lost market share to competitors and seeks to make a comeback with its new BlackBerry 10 phone. The device will go on sale in the U.S. next month. The Pentagon said it wants employees to have the flexibility to use commercial products on its systems, including its classified network for the first time. It plans to create a military mobile applications store and hire a contractor to build a system that may eventually handle as many as 8 million devices. “This is not simply about embracing the newest technology –- it is about keeping the department’s workforce relevant in an era when information accessibility and cybersecurity play a critical role in mission success,” Teri Takai, the department’s chief information officer, said in a statement.</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1367446071047</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-01 18:07:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367446308884-162</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung delays launch of Knox Android security software until 'later date' (Source PCWorld)....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1367158552197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-04-28 10:15:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Samsung does not need expensive lawsuits with AAPL....

AT this stage, AAPL beating up Samsung, serves Mr. Softy well as they have WP-8 OS ready and that MSFT will triple their Mobility revenues from what they make off Android's patents.... AS for the move by the Pentagon, it is a small move and as Samsung moves to WP-8, they will use MSFT as they are already planning to go on Windows 8 with DoD and the rest of the US military per nearly $700.00 million contract awarded in Jan/2013.

The patent, US20120278904, works as a surveillance mechanism, inbuilt within devices including television sets, computers, smartphones and tablets in order to enforce digital rights management (DRM). In other words, if you're streaming content without a license, it can be detected -- and your media stream cut off. Here is the patent summary: "A content presentation system and method allowing content providers to regulate the presentation of content on a per-user-view basis. Content is distributed an associated license option on the number of individual consumers or viewers allowed to consume the content. Consumers are presented with a content selection and a choice of licenses allowing consumption of the content. The users consuming the content on a display device are monitored so that if the number of user-views licensed is exceeded, remedial action may be taken."

"The patent also mentions that age and identity can be detected in relation to whether a viewer is authorized to see particular content. The technology can also enforce time frames that users are allowed to see media. The technology is designed to work with cloud streamed content, downloaded material and media stored in either removable or irremovable storage systems. These include "RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, DVD or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices."

He can't understand he is talking to maybe 5 people, and all his anti Obama efforts are no different than throwing a handful of sand into the air on the beach. He has gone off the edge with posting, even getting banned by yahoo, it's a total addiction.
