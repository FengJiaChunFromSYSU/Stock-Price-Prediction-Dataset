Teachers have always gotten and still get fired for being "bad." The unions make it honest. No cousin or girlfriend of an administrator can bump you off your job. The rwnjs here sit on their fat azzes posting messages all day about teachers who are out going to work and doing a job the rwnj wouldn't last one day in. What is this preoccupation with teachers all about? Just look at hawfaeces can you imagine trying to teach something into that brain? If hawfaeces won't learn, is it your fault? Imagine 40 hawfaeces stubbornly sitting in front of you at 8:30 in the morning and your job is to teach them, all day. They all want to be home posting messages and are looking out the window or at the clock. In China they all have their hands up to be first to answer and know the reason to be at the school.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1348632236239</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 00:03:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348632917013-2</Id><Topic><Title>Strength in WIndows 8 launch</Title><Username>topinvestgun1</Username><Timestamp>1348194831526</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-09-20 22:33:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm long MSFT but I'm concerned for the Win 8 launch.

The claim, though, is open to debate. It only holds up in a particular scenario in which both income and all payroll taxes are counted. The president's campaign presumably is referring to Romney's release last week of his 2011 tax returns, which showed he paid an effective tax rate of 14.1 percent. This revelation, as might be expected, fueled a wave of campaign stump speeches and videos. The latest was an Obama Web video blasting Romney's "strange take on tax fairness." It included clips of people accusing Romney of paying a lower rate than "average" Americans. An accompanying campaign email said: "Mitt Romney admitted he thinks it's fair that his $20 million income was taxed at a lower rate than someone making $50,000." IRS data, though, shows that Romney's effective income tax rate -- that's what he pays as a percentage of his income once deductions and other benefits are factored in -- is actually far higher than what most Americans pay. And it's certainly higher than what someone making $50,000 pays. IRS data from 2010 shows someone making between $50,000 and $75,000 on average pays an effective rate of 7.8 percent. Even someone making between $100,000 and $200,000 pays a 12.1 percent rate -- also lower than Romney's. So what is the Obama campaign referring to? There are a couple possibilities. The campaign likely is trying to make the point that Romney's income -- at least the huge chunk of it that is derived from investments -- is taxed at a 15 percent rate, while others who earn their money from a paycheck are taxed at marginal income rates going all the way up to 35 percent. The latter percentage, though, comes down once deductions and exemptions are included. The Tax Foundation estimated in a report in January that Romney's rate in 2010 -- which was also about 14 percent -- was higher than what 97 percent of Americans pay.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1348666582785</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 09:36:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1348670100606-16</Id><Title>$65 by X-mas????</Title><Msg>Does this old rusty car have more life????

It's like step #1. It is a fed offense to lie about that, it is a form to sign. I signed one in 2009. They know you have a tenant because you are supposed to report the income, depreciation, and expenses on a tax return. It is absolutely required to depreciate the property. If you lie and don't do that, the tenant may well report something, like their address there or taking a renters credit, and you may get caught. There were no fed restrictions on buying income property I have heard about, maybe at the banks you looked at, but that was their choice, not federal involvement.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1348696499016</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 17:54:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348697510343-52</Id><Topic><Title>....Intel (INTC) Issues Statement on Unsubstantiated News Reports</Title><Username>buffet_graham</Username><Timestamp>1348693989768</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 17:13:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just ask yourself, which statement sounds like it could be true, and which sounds like utterly unbelievable PR hype?

For the debut album by Shirley Scott recorded for Prestige in 1958, see Great Scott! (album). For the album by Shirley Scott recorded for Impulse! in 1964, see Great Scott!!. Great Scott! is an exclamation of surprise, amazement, or dismay. [edit] Possible origins This article may contain original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding references. Statements consisting only of original research may be removed. (July 2012) The origin of the expression is uncertain, with several plausible sources. A likely source is as a reference to American Civil War commander‑in‑chief of the U.S. Army, General Winfield Scott. The general, known to his troops as Old Fuss and Feathers, weighed 300 pounds (21 stone or 136 kg) in his later years and was too fat to ride a horse.[1] A May 1861 edition of the New York Times included the sentence: These gathering hosts of loyal freemen, under the command of the great SCOTT. In an 1871 issue of the Galaxy, the expression itself is quoted: "Great—Scott!" he gasped in his stupefaction, using the name of the then commander-in-chief for an oath, as officers sometimes did in those days. The phrase also appears in the 3 May 1864 diary entry by Private Robert Knox Sneden (later published as Eye of the Storm: a Civil War Odyssey): ‘Great Scott,’ who would have thought that this would be the destiny of the Union Volunteer in 1861–2 while marching down Broadway to the tune of ‘John Brown’s Body’.[1] Another possible origin is an anglicized corruption of an expression used by the German Albert, Prince Consort of Queen Victoria, transforming "Grüss Gott" ("Greet God") into "Great Scott". The etymologist and author John Ciardi once believed this, but later recanted in a radio broadcast in 1985. Similarly, the expression could be a minced oath, derived from the English phrase "[by the] grace of God".[citation needed] Another possible source comes from Mark Twain's hate for Sir Walter Scott and his writing, which popularized historical fiction and romanticized war in general. Twain's disdain for Scott is evident in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, in which the main character repeatedly utters "great Scott" as an oath, and in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, where he names a sinking boat the Walter Scott.</Msg><Username>just_1_more_bing</Username><Timestamp>1348702396285</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-09-26 19:33:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1348702431201-60</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Pulling Ahead Of Romney</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1348606866483</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-25 17:01:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In 2009 "they" were making loans on income residential property.
