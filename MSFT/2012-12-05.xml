There must be some ways to work this out.</Msg><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1354722577266</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 10:49:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354723240375-36</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT should announce massive share buyback</Title><Username>geosmart668</Username><Timestamp>1354672292432</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 20:51:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think they would have done it already.</Msg><Username>sammsjohn99</Username><Timestamp>1354723240375</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 11:00:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354725094031-37</Id><Topic><Title>Tax Cuts On The Wealthy Become A Debt Burden On The Backs Of Our Children</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1354670618665</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 20:23:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What happened to tax revenue in the UK when they raised rates?

This was the first time ever in their store. I was there around 3PM. Store had some customers, but not a lot. I saw no purchasing going on, but really not sure about that. There were a lot of sales people, or whatever they are called. Most if not all seemed knowledgeable, helpful and polite. I talked to one in particular who seemed to know Win8 and Surface fairly well. I had not experienced either the Surface or Win8 till yesterday. I enjoyed both. The touch screen on Win 8 both PC and Surface are cool. I think I got used to it fairly quickly, and had no issues with the experience. The store had a wide array of products, from tablets, Lumia and HTC phones, laptops and desktops. They had a Samsung laptop displayed, that also converts to a tablet. Yet, they were out of it. I was wondering if they were phasing it out for Surface Pro. I enjoyed my first time on the Surface. I first used the less expensive Touch Cover. I found that to be slightly awkward, and was feeling disappointed at first. One of the employees mentioned I should try the Type Cover as a comparison. I had no issues with the Type Cover, and it was a big improvement. The salesperson mentioned that Surface sales were brisk, and this person thinks sales will continue, especially when Surface Pro comes out. The machine felt strong in all respects. I kept plugging and unplugging connections, and all seemed fluid and strong. There was really nothing I did not like, other than the pricing of the Surface Pro. Granted, I have never used an Ipad before, and occasionally play with my wife’s Kindle Fire. I am not sure if this is accurate, but the salesperson explained that the Ipad and other tablets are consumer devices, whereas the Surface is a business and consumer device. I was kidding with one of the salespeople that I was going to journey over to the Apple Store, and unlike the Microsoft Store, it might be packed with customers. The salesperson said, “You are probably correct. They have an installed base and have been around a lot longer.” I went to the store, and really the customer concentration was not vastly different at the Apple Store. There were more customers for sure, but whereas Microsoft employee to customer ratio seemed like 5:1, the Apple store seemed like 4:1. An Apple salesperson was showing me different devices and tablets. I saw a big screen which was a computer, and really nice, except it wasn’t touch screen. I was shown the Ipad mini, Ipad 2 and Ipad Retina (I probably am getting the names wrong.) I was toying around with it, and it was okay, no great shakes. The Surface felt better and I liked it more, yet at a minimum, I have positive sub-conscious Microsoft bias. I asked the person how it compares with the Surface. The response went something like this: “I spent some time on the Surface, maybe about an hour. I liked it. It had lots of unique things that surprised me. I like the way Microsoft went off their Windows format, and seems to have completely changed that experience.” I asked, “Would you buy a Surface?” The salesperson responded with something like, “I have really only used Apple products, plus I work here, so I only buy Apple stuff. I bought my dad an Ipad, and he is an old time Windows guy. He likes the Ipad, but it has its application limitations. I think he would like the Surface because it can use some business applications. Yet, those applications are not the same as a laptop, so there are still limitations.” I asked “What about when Surface Pro comes out? It seems like other than what appears to be a high cost, you get a tablet that does full applications?” The Apple Salesperson said something like, “Are you sure, I have not heard of this product.” I suggested we check it out online. The Apple Salesperson said something like, “Wow, this is cool. You are right, a bit pricey, but first look and being introduced to it, it looks cool. I think my dad should see this.” I asked if he would consider buying his dad a Surface Pro as a gift, and the salesperson said, “I have to evaluate the cost and so forth, but this looks like something my dad would love. If I could substantiate the cost, I would definitely consider getting my dad the Surface Pro. Wow, I can’t believe I haven’t heard of this, it looks really cool.” There are my 2 cents. I submit this with bias and hope that Microsoft continues to succeed in her big picture ventures.</Msg><Username>bengrahamman</Username><Timestamp>1354727369041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:09:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354727380594-43</Id><Topic><Title>Tax Cuts On The Wealthy Become A Debt Burden On The Backs Of Our Children</Title><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1354670618665</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 20:23:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Tax cuts under Dubya Bush did nothing to create jobs" You're right, that myth has been pretty much put to rest now that the election is over.</Msg><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1354727380594</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:09:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354727453826-44</Id><Title>Just sold for nice gain and knowing me to soon.</Title><Msg>777777777777777777777777</Msg><Username>indexit</Username><Timestamp>1354727453826</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:10:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354727766351-45</Id><Title>ruh roh, msft green, apple red</Title><Msg>how you like dem apples!</Msg><Username>lightdoesnotage</Username><Timestamp>1354727766351</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:16:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354727924719-46</Id><Topic><Title>Maintaining tax rates for the 'wealthy' is a 'burden' on the poor?</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1354720420545</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 10:13:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We citizens get it from the Constitution, one vote, all equal, go read it.

Close to $8 per share of cash as of 9/30/12. Free Cash Flow and earnings are both of high quality, and I believe both to be stable at a minimum. P/E ratio is 9.39X, based on our projected F2013 earnings of $2.71 per share. Dividend yield is 2.6%. We project the dividend payout ratio to be a healthy and conservative 30%. I don't see them being replaced in enterprise. Trying to "kill this investment," and I can't. I just don't see the degradation of the company that so many others discuss (see yearly comparisons below). My favorite part of the investment thesis is the current price. Of course, could go lower, a lot lower, but that is the way investing is. I think many think that revenues have not been increasing, or are in decline. Maybe the stock price catalyst would be the understanding of the simple math, and seeing that revenues, contrary to popular perception have been on the rise for a decade + (not including F2009 where there was a decline.) Projected investment returns for 15 years are estimated at 15% to 22% annualized based on current price. Waiting to hear about penetration of Surface. Windows 8 projected to be slow but steady penetration, similar to Windows 7.</Msg><Username>bengrahamman</Username><Timestamp>1354734884707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 14:14:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354735047277-71</Id><Topic><Title>ATT Excutive stated today - Windows phones are selling very well at ATT</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1354729910255</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:51:50 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They must be selling good because I know three people that bought theirs in the last couple of weeks &amp; really like them,funny how the idiotic trolls like Queen can't stand it when M$FT does well in anything LOL.</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1354735047277</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 14:17:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354735104851-72</Id><Topic><Title>My MSFT Investment Thesis</Title><Username>bengrahamman</Username><Timestamp>1354734884707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 14:14:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Waiting to hear about penetration of Surface.

But the Surface stays thin for carrying even with keyboad. So I'll lighten-up and say that the Surface might be one of the form factors that the market wants. But then there needs to be three Surface. One with a ARM processor and RT since it's related to mobile phones in the market, one with an Intel Haswell processor and Win 8, and one with an Intel Bay Trail processor and Win 8. Of course the Surface Pro has the forerunner to Haswell. The next problem is that while the core operation of Win 8 is okay, the Win 8 interface looks awful. They probably just went to the wrong design studio. I would shape the tiles like cross-word-puzzle pieces but without the tabs (patent application within six months). But I like the Samsung ATIV 500T and Samsung ATIV 700T form factors. I also like the Samsung 13.3" Series 9 laptop at 2.6 pounds but with Win 7. And so there's the next problem. Windows 8 is for tablets. When I touch a laptop screen it flops around. With a desktop, the reach for the mouse is shorter than the reach for the screen. HP Shopping is selling the same desktop computers under two different model numbers. One model number is Win 8 while the other model number is Win 7.</Msg><Username>hia_intell</Username><Timestamp>1354759852890</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 21:10:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354760471452-128</Id><Topic><Title>With Win 8 hybrids like Surface Pro, you get a laptop and a free tablet</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1354498241047</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-12-02 20:30:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The 747 cargo plane came in.

Both iOS and Android now at risk as iOS can't justify premium it asking and andorid is copy of iOS and messy already require complete rewrite to remain competive.) I see two reason that Analyst/Blogger use to trash Windows 8. 1. No App choices (Total BS as Windows 8 RT actually support full browser - Ask yourself Would you see need for various Application like Local channel/weather/video player/Yahoo mail/Gmai/.. when you can do same thing in Browser. When I am using PC I hardly try to find such apps (As they are meaning less) 2. Windows 8 RT is confusing ( Not sure if OS is confusing or they got confuse how to trash Windows 8) Windows 8 visibily advance, interface are advance, best Social integration, best cloud integration and still has much more quality &amp; productive applications. Don't listen to BS from Blogger/Analyst. Reason Surface not selling fast is due to limited distribution. Microsoft is unnessasarly careful not to disappoint PC OEMs. After all they need PC OEMs to keep PC volume but They forget PC OEMs need Microsoft to even survive.</Msg><Username>vs1234gs</Username><Timestamp>1354767123501</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 23:12:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354767161492-142</Id><Topic><Title>Romney buys a new Audi</Title><Username>hawrcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1354751448882</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 18:50:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Audis steer so much better than the up-market Toyota you speak of.</Msg><Username>ghosananon</Username><Timestamp>1354767161492</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 23:12:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354767409201-143</Id><Title>Full Browser /Flash/ Sliver Light Support = ????

Fact that they force people to learn Metro interface, once user know Metro Inteface, they will prefer Windows RT Tablet. Microsoft is still zillion pound gorilla when it come to computing. Don't think people are stupid enough to listen all those blogger/analyst. They will realize $500 hybrid tablet is much better deal than other cheaper tablet or so call premium tablet. Also School who currently supporting IPAD will love Surface. Touch Typing without noise is perfect for schools and Microsoft is good at making deals.
