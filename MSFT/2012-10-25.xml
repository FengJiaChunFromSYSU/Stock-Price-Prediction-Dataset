It "all dates back to when we were growing up together in Kenya," the president said on "The Tonight Show." Trump has long doubted the veracity of Obama's birth certificate showing that he was born in Hawaii. On Wednesday, Trump offered to donate $5 million to a charity of Obama's choice if the president releases his college and passport records by the end of the month. “We had constant run-ins on the soccer field,” Obama told host Jay Leno. “He wasn't very good and resented it. When we finally moved to America, I thought it would be over." Obama said he and Trump have never met, even though Trump was at the 2011 White House Correspondents' Dinner when the president roasted the real estate and reality TV mogul.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1351147121862</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 02:38:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351165266056-3</Id><Title>W8 Release Tomorrow</Title><Msg>i'm so excited..!!</Msg><Username>nostra_dumbass666</Username><Timestamp>1351165266056</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 07:41:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351165997852-4</Id><Title>35 - here we come as Win8 and Surface will blow all expectations</Title><Msg>It is going to be Huge!!!</Msg><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1351165997852</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 07:53:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351168005355-5</Id><Topic><Title>35 - here we come as Win8 and Surface will blow all expectations</Title><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1351165997852</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 07:53:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Win8 and Surface will blow" True that...</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1351168005355</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 08:26:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351168046073-6</Id><Topic><Title>35 - here we come as Win8 and Surface will blow all expectations</Title><Username>balak_joshi</Username><Timestamp>1351165997852</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 07:53:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Win 8 demo with Balmer now.

There is only an embassy, located in Tripoli. The Embassy website refers to the facility in Benghazi as a “mission.” (2) The “mission” in Benghazi had CIA and other agents, but none of the consular officials one would expect to find at U.S. consulates. Apparently, no consular services were offered there. (3) Apparently lots of munitions (from undisclosed sources) were stored at Benghazi and they are apparently missing now. Are U.S. “consulates” normally used for such purposes? The Benghazi mission seems to have been a strange place if the purpose was to keep them secure. (4) No effective U.S. action was taken to thwart or to end the attack. Sources told CBS there were fighter jets and Specter AC-130 gunships stationed at three nearby bases. But Pentagon officials told reporters the military moved a special ops team from central Europe to Sigonella, Italy instead – an hour’s flight from Libya – and refused to provide further details.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1351179821357</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:43:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351179850144-105</Id><Topic><Title>WHEN YOU ARE OVER 30 AND VOTE FOR LIBERALS YOU ARE BRAINLESS, SAID CHURCHILL.</Title><Username>penma1</Username><Timestamp>1351178923559</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:28:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Churchill was dead wrong on that one</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351179850144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:44:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351179952712-106</Id><Topic><Title>MIMV: MOBILE APPS SEARCH &amp; MSFT PARTNER....INPLAY @.39.....20 BAGGER FROM HERE...EOM</Title><Username>cashflow599</Username><Timestamp>1351173942144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 10:05:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>STRONG VOLUME NOW</Msg><Username>cashflow599</Username><Timestamp>1351179952712</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:45:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351179990294-107</Id><Topic><Title>Obamma's military reaction to Benghazi terrorist attack</Title><Username>xcrewshe8n</Username><Timestamp>1351178882673</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:28:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thats nuthing Romney's Bain capital financed the murders of American men women and children But hey - thats OK long as the super rich benefit</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351179990294</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:46:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351180166664-108</Id><Title>Romeny is a communist, marxist and moooslim terrorist mole</Title><Msg>Bain Capital proves it - i</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1351180166664</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 11:49:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351180242328-109</Id><Title>IT Freaks are controlling the HFT</Title><Msg>and the rest of the losers at Hedge Funds getting credit for it LOL!!!!!

AAPL RTQ $610.89 down -5.94 Denial of fact In this form of denial, someone avoids a fact by lying. This lying can take the form of an outright falsehood (commission), leaving out certain details to tailor a story (omission), or by falsely agreeing to something (assent, also referred to as "yessing" behavior). Someone who is in denial of fact is typically using lies to avoid facts they think may be painful to themselves or others. Denial of responsibility This form of denial involves avoiding personal responsibility by:  blaming: a direct statement shifting culpability and may overlap with denial of fact  minimizing: an attempt to make the effects or results of an action appear to be less harmful than they may actually be, or  justifying: when someone takes a choice and attempts to make that choice look okay due to their perception of what is "right" in a situation. Someone using denial of responsibility is usually attempting to avoid potential harm or pain by shifting attention away from themselves.

The bigger reason is to ask why did DT want to pay 5 mil to see Obama's school records and passports? Of course it was just a bluff anyway, to be able to say "see he is hiding them" but DT knows he never will have to pay anything that's why he made it 5 million.

Human Rights Council Calls for Boycott of U.S. Companies U.N.'s war on Israel puts American economy in crosshairs HRC HRC BY: Washington Free Beacon Staff October 25, 2012 12:56 pm The Washington Free Beacon has obtained a report soon to be released by the United Nations that calls for an international campaign of legal attacks and economic warfare on a group of American companies that do business in Israel, including Hewlett-Packard, Caterpillar Inc., and Motorola Solutions Inc. The Human Rights Council (HRC), a body dominated by Islamic countries and known for its hostility to, and heavy focus on, the Jewish State, issued the report. The George W. Bush administration refused to participate in the HRC, but President Barack Obama joined it soon after taking office. Members of the HRC include infamous human rights abusers such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Libya, China, and Cuba. The Obama-approved body maintains a “Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories [sic].” The current rapporteur is American college professor Richard Falk, a 9/11 “truther” who once posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his personal blog. In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon, the Anti-Defamation League’s Abraham Foxman blasted the report and the HRC’s special rapporteur: “We believe you should have prevented the Secretariat from being a party to Mr. Falk’s anti-Israel agenda. Mr. Falk’s entire tenure as Special Rapporteur has served to undermine the credibility of the institution of the United Nations.” The report attempts to instigate a campaign of boycott, divestment, sanctions, and legal action against a litany of international companies doing business in Israel. In addition to American companies, the U.N. targets include major European firms such as Veolia Environnement, Group 4 Security, the Dexia Group, the Volvo Group. “The costs to companies and businesses of failing to respect international humanitarian law are considerable,” the report warns, “including damage to a company’s public image, impact on shareholder decisions and share price and could result in employees being criminally responsible for rights abuses.” The report warns American employees of targeted companies that they face legal risks. “Employees of companies can face investigation and prosecution for human rights violations committed irrespective of where the violation was committed.” In addition to legal action against American employees of targeted companies, the Special Rapporteur “concludes that all companies that operate in or otherwise have dealings with Israeli settlements should be boycotted.” The companies should ”be prepared to accept any consequences—reputation, financial, or legal—of continuing operations.” Should the companies continue doing business in Israel, the Human Rights Council “calls on civil society to actively pursue legal and political redress against non-complying business” and “to vigorously pursue initiatives to boycott, divest and sanction the businesses highlighted in this report” and “calls on the international community to consider requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice” to punish the businesses. When the Obama administration joined the Human Rights Council in 2009, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice pledged, “Working from within, we can make the council a more effective forum to promote and protect human rights.”</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1351190079720</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:34:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351190887559-152</Id><Topic><Title>Why Didn't Trump Offer $5M To Romney For His Tax Returns ???</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1351181758001</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:15:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>he did release him you dope</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1351190887559</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:48:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351191170070-153</Id><Topic><Title>Why Didn't Trump Offer $5M To Romney For His Tax Returns ???</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1351181758001</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:15:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Rasmussen Poll: Romney Leads Obama in Swing States 50-46 Thursday, 25 Oct 2012 01:22 PM Mitt Romney is now attracting support from 50 percent of voters nationwide, while President Obama earns the vote from 47 percent — an indication that the GOP candidate is holding his lead and momentum after the final debate earlier this week. More importantly, a new Rasmussen poll shows the Republican leading Obama in the crucial swing states that will determine the election, according to new data released Thursday. The swing states collectively hold 146 Electoral College votes and include Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. In the 11 swing states, Mitt Romney earns 50 percent of the vote to Obama’s 46 percent. Two percent like another candidate in the race, and another two percent are undecided. This is now the third day in a row - and the fifth time in the past six days - that Romney has hit the 50 percent mark in the combined swing states in a Rassmussen poll. The survey is conducted on a rolling seven-day basis, and most of the interviews for today’s update were completed before the end of Monday night’s presidential debate. Romney has now held a modest lead for 14 of the last 17 days; Obama was ahead twice, and the candidates ran even once. The news comes as several new polls indicate Romney is losing ground in the key battleground state of Ohio while holding steady in electoral vote-rich Florida. Even more surprisingly, an Associated Press-GfK poll released Thursday showed both candidates closing their formidable gender gaps. Romney has erased Obama's 16-point advantage among women, the poll showed. And the president, in turn, has largely eliminated Romney's edge among men.</Msg><Username>hillary_is_sewage</Username><Timestamp>1351191170070</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:52:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351191388178-154</Id><Topic><Title>do they have retail stores like Apple to teach users about Windows 8?</Title><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1351189317910</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:21:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>get as clue, try one out for yourself idiot</Msg><Username>catchofthedayus</Username><Timestamp>1351191388178</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 14:56:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351191410330-155</Id><Topic><Title>Why Didn't Trump Offer $5M To Romney For His Tax Returns ???</Title><Username>hawcraper</Username><Timestamp>1351181758001</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:15:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yah, when will we see those complete tax returns from romney? he knows he is losing that's why he won't show them.
