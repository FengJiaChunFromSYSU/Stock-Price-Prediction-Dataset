Or, rather, knowing can get you in trouble. Its best to see if there is a consensus and then try to do the opposite. Better still it is good to act if even you believe what you are doing is dumb. Now with MSFT the steady selling is good. Stock is a dog and people are sick of missing out while everything else goes up. I had a lot of stocks that did this to me (THC NCS SBCF NXST) but that is not a problem. Right now the market is scary. I am short now a little IJH and HD. Shorting is stupid because you need a stop.
