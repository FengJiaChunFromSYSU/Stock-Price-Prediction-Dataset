"In November 2003, nationwide telephone penetration among low-income households with incomes below $10,000 was 84.0 percent. The nationwide telephone penetration rate for all households at the same time was 94.7 percent. States that have taken full advantage of federal universal service support for low-income consumers saw an average growth in telephone penetration for low-income households of over 4 percent from March 1997 to March 2003. In contrast, states that did not provide Lifeline support beyond the basic federal support experienced an average growth in telephone penetration rates of less than 1 percent.8 In 2003, over 6.6 million subscribers paid reduced local rates under the Lifeline program. The Link Up America program, which supports affordable connections to the network, has connected over 16.2 million telephone subscribers since 1987. The Commissionâ€™s rules are designed to satisfy the 1996 Act's mandates that rates be "affordable" and access should be provided to "low-income consumers" in all regions of the nation. The rules also make the contribution to and distribution of low-income support competitively and technologically neutral by requiring equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions from all providers of interstate telecommunications services, and by allowing all eligible telecommunications carriers, including wireless carriers, to receive support for offering Lifeline and Link Up service."

Development of Windows 8 started before the release of its predecessor, Windows 7, in 2009. PC sales actually grew that year in spite of early 2009 Gartner predictions of a 12% falloff. PC sales going forward from that point actually grew on average year over year exhibiting marginal growth or holding steady in both 2010 and 2011. The latest decrease in global sales of PCs occurs well after W8 development began, closer to the release of the product rather than the beginning of its development cycle and was a reaction to competition in the mobile sector, having nothing whatsoever to do with "helping boost the PC biz". You are the dimmest of dim bulbs and a liar as well. W8 will impact PC sales negatively, not the other way around.

True, not all of these installed into PC's are used. Not every computers built with W8 were sold, your point is valid. But the PC manufacturers bought them; they could have said: "ok, we have seen enough after 10 millions or 30 millions" Why they didn't stop there? Why did they continue to waste more money? You have to assume that these are itelligent individuals who can figure what works and what doesn't work. This is a new software (W8) and the sell # is equivalent to Windows 7 (which is the best version of all the window softwares since the inception of msft). But think about this for a minute, it would be easier to sell the best model (W7) because it is essentially the same as the rest before it, except better than the ones before, than to sell something (W8) that is entirely differet from all the previous windows softwares. The fact that it is so different, the fear is that it may not work well. HOWEVER, the fact that it sold well in par to the best (W7), it suggests that it must be an awesome software. Infact, W8 was awarded as the best invention of 2012 (bing it!).</Msg><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358543147479</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 16:05:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358543822229-79</Id><Topic><Title>MOre than 60 million copies of W8 sold says it all</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358530222051</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-01-18 12:30:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>the question you have to ask yourself is: why are the analysts love to bash msft when it is trading at the bottom? Evidently they are selling aapl. But where are they putting their money after they sell apple? Coincidently apple falls at the same time as W8 came into the market but they didn't bash apple at that time instead they said apple was going to $1000/sh or $1350. Hmmmmm......I wonder who are secretly buying and bashing msft. The market is full of crooks.
