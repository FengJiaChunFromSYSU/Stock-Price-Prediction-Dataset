You are right. All the eyewitnesses, pilots and other aircraft crew in the air in that area at the time, the reporters from various major news organizations and motorists on the streets and highways surrounding the Pentagon that testified to what they saw are liars. Dozens of them (over 150 eyewitnesses) that never met each other are all co conspirators in a vast evil scheme to hide the truth. The voice and data recorders from AA 77 obviously detached themselves from the aircraft at its ACTUAL crash site that no one has ever found and either walked or hitchhiked to the Pentagon from Pennsylvania and embedded themselves in the crash debris hoping to be found there and create the false impression that AA 77 had been there and then disappeared like the Easter Bunny. The data retrieval technical experts that extracted and reconstructed the info on the flight recorder are known prevaricators and ne'er do wells, every one of them. This is widely recognized. Search: Warren Stutt, AAL77 FDR Decoder Output Files This is great technical fantasy and proves your "theory" beyond a shadow of a doubt. From "2008 book, Firefight: Inside the Battle to Save the Pentagon on 9/11": *According to Creed and Newman, “The instant its nose struck the outer wall of the Pentagon, Flight 77 ceased to be an airplane.” At that moment physics [and chemistry, the laws of science] took over. It became a “roaring mass of fluid and debris…a tidal wave…” “The Pentagon finally arrested the forward movement of Flight 77. The mass plowed through the C Ring and blew a round hole, about 12 feet in diamenter, through the ring’s inner wall.” From the moment of impact, the entire event had taken place in eight-tenths of a second.* What the heck do they know? The newly reconstructed section of the Pentagon into which both steel reinforcement designed to protect against missile and bomb attack, and shrapnel preventive cloth designed to prevent the fragmentation of the sandstone and concrete of the facade and main structure, is unique in that it is the only portion of the building reinforced in that fashion and just happens to be the portion of the structure that your mystery missile impacted. That particular section constituted a very effective shredder and strainer, essentially shattering, disintegrating and liquifying all but the smallest fragments of the most indestructible components constituting whatever hit the building. Of course the fact that engines were running at full throttle lent absolutely nothing to the destructive power of the 350 MPH impact. Turbine blades of titanium wouldn't be damaged much by punching through a few walls of concrete, stone and steel just because the engines at maximum thrust in excess of 20,000 lb and maximum rotation of the fastest internal turbine blades in excess of 10,000 or 12,000 RPM were ingesting all that material, would they? Noting that the PSA 182 plane photos show an engine that is a charred, un ducted, de cowled and barely recognizable skeleton of what was once a RAT, it must also be noted that the 727 hit the ground, cratered and stopped rather than punching through multiple walls of thick, steel reinforced concrete and sandstone, heavy construction tools, etc. Don't bother to reply to any of this. Arguing with conspiracy buff idiots that selectively review the facts to reach their untenable conclusions is not my idea of a productive use of my time.

KROFT: Mr. President, this morning you went out of your way to avoid the use of the word terrorism in connection with the Libya Attack, do you believe that this was a terrorism attack? OBAMA: Well it’s too early to tell exactly how this came about, what group was involved, but obviously it was an attack on Americans. And we are going to be working with the Libyan government to make sure that we bring these folks to justice, one way or the other. KROFT: It’s been described as a mob action, but there are reports that they were very heavily armed with grenades, that doesn’t sound like your normal demonstration. OBAMA: As I said, we’re still investigating exactly what happened, I don’t want to jump the gun on this. But your right that this is not a situation that was exactly the same as what happened in Egypt. And my suspicion is there are folks involved in this. Who were looking to target Americans from the start. So we’re gonna make sure that our first priority is to get our folks out safe, make sure our embassies are secured around the world and then we are going to go after those folks who carried this out.

Falling off the kitchen table would hardly be classified as normal wear and tear for any electronic device especially a table computer . OTOH, "According to multiple posts on Microsoft's Surface Forum, the edge of Surface Touch keyboards can split open at the seam where the keyboard-cover magnetically attaches to the tablet unit, exposing wiring within." THAT would constitute normal use as the Surface keyboard is DESIGNED to work just that way. Falling off the kitchen table = NEGLIGENCE on the part of the user. Opening at the seam where the keyboard-cover magnetically attaches to the tablet unit, exposing wiring within = DESIGN FLAW or MANUFACTURER DEFECT.

I'm assuming yes. I think the best place to start would be the Surface. Sell the Surface RT with a keyboard for $399. MSFT will make a little money on each one, but they will bring AWARENESS to their product. Why pay $600 for an "unproven" surface when you can buy a "proven" iPad mini for under $400. The iPad has tons of apps, the Surface has few. Personally, I would purchase a Surface w/ keyboard for $399, but not at $600, and I'm a fairly loyal MSFT consumer. Now, all the users that purchased a surface will realize it's pretty awesome. I think this would spur W8 phone sales and the creation of many apps for both. Now the W8 can integrate with XBOX 360....another cool feature. I think if MSFT would take this approach, they would be more likely to get some street cred as an actual OS for laptops (professional). MSFT can't sell/price it's product as the "best" product because it's still unproven. Take a small hit and get the product out there... it's the only way Surface will succeed.</Msg><Username>stockwoodie</Username><Timestamp>1353534549202</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 16:49:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353535604157-83</Id><Topic><Title>Forget about "Electoral College" we should have "Tax College" voting</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1353506698205</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-11-21 09:04:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"Libtards are too dumb to vote" Really???

Even more troubling is that we are on course for still greater changes to our planet in the years ahead. That’s the key takeaway from a major new report from the World Bank, which examines the impact of a 4 degree Celsius (7.2 degree Fahrenheit) warmer world. At the same time, a new analysis by World Resources Institute (WRI) finds there are nearly 1,200 proposed coal plants worldwide. If these plants come online, our chances of staying within 2 degrees of warming—the level recommended to prevent the worst consequences of climate change—would be nil. The World Bank is not prone to hyperbole. Its warning that we could be heading to 4 degrees of rising global temperatures should be taken extremely seriously by leaders around the world. The World Bank’s assessment reaffirms what many of us already understand: scientific evidence of human-caused global warming is unequivocal. Given that it took little more than 4 degrees of cooling to create the last Ice Age, it would be hard to overstate how 4 degrees of warming could reshape our world by the end of this century.
