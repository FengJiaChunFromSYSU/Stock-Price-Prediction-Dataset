Beyond Mitt's continuing obligations in service to Bain Capital in an executive capacity, for which he was paid in restricted stock as was usual for the interval during which he was working post-"retroactive retirement" and was laundered through one of several "blind trusts" that were set up prior to his leveraged buy-out of the Governorship of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for precisely that money laundering purpose, there are interesting features to the 2010 return itself that make it a bit clearer why there's no doubt at all that Mitt paid ZERO Federal income and capital gains taxes during the years 1999 and 2009 and decided that his 2010 return would need to be "punched up" a bit during the customary extension interval for political purposes. Mitt carried a bit of baggage with him from his prior tax strategies, before he was running for President for Pete's sake, that give a bit of insight into what we can expect to see in tax returns for the years during which he continued to work at Bain Capital after his "retroactive retirement" and during his Governorship hobby / racket and his continuing eighteen year campaign to buy out the Presidency and achieve his ultimate racketeering goals.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345719100000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 06:51:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345722532000-10</Id><Topic><Title>Ya repubs better get to work</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1345681391000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 20:23:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>K then, 4 more of Obama.</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1345722532000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 07:48:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345727044000-11</Id><Topic><Title>K*O*C*H Bros Have Billions For Commercials</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1345679930000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 19:58:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What about the Koch bros father Fred Koch Sr who worked for that arch communist Joe Stalin designing and construction oil refineries and chemical plants- Now there is my kind of anti communist- trained his boys the same way too</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1345727044000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:04:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345727172000-12</Id><Topic><Title>K*O*C*H Bros Have Billions For Commercials</Title><Username>captain_tweezers</Username><Timestamp>1345679930000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 19:58:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey freedomless are you a communist too-- you sound like a closet communist who cant admit what he really is at heart</Msg><Username>whsteffanmsn</Username><Timestamp>1345727172000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:06:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345727318000-13</Id><Topic><Title>What's poignant MSFT into a Blazing Stock...</Title><Username>brady.mccormick42</Username><Timestamp>1345723709000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 08:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Worst SPAM EVER - Malware hacker virus site.</Msg><Username>nw_ripper</Username><Timestamp>1345727318000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:08:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345728133000-14</Id><Title>A " Clear Choice"</Title><Msg>Listen up and hear the truth! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xsZ45Weng0</Msg><Username>mendelcarmen</Username><Timestamp>1345728133000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:22:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345728178000-15</Id><Topic><Title>Idea to solve tax cut extension impasse</Title><Username>hawcreek10</Username><Timestamp>1345726223000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 08:50:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is the Obama plan the one rejected by even the Democrats?</Msg><Username>reasonableme53</Username><Timestamp>1345728178000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 09:22:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345728660000-16</Id><Title>Even big eye doesn't like RWNJs - sends hurricane to disturb</Title><Msg>their convention.

Much of that money ended up leaving our shores. A $2.4 billion stimulus program to support battery production sent nearly half of its money to foreign firms, including two South Korean companies that used their awards to hire foreign nationals in Michigan to do work that Americans easily could have done. In the end, despite all the money Obama handed out, electric vehicle sales have lagged and The Washington Post deemed his goal of one million electric cars "overly optimistic." Wind Farms Obama's stimulus included over $8.5 billion in grants for wind farms that flowed overseas, despite Congressional criticism from both sides of the aisle. In total, over half of the money went to either foreign developers or foreign wind turbine manufacturers, creating thousands of jobs overseas with money that was supposed to create jobs within the United States. Even worse, hundreds of millions of dollars went to wind farms that began construction before the stimulus was passed. The end result of all this spending: the wind energy industry lost 10,000 jobs last year. Manufacturing TaxCredits As Obama was doling out over $2.3 billion in clean energy manufacturing tax credits that were supposed to create jobs in America, $880 million went to foreign firms. Worse still, some of those same recipients are now closing up shop and shipping jobs overseas. Loan Guarantees Remember Solyndra? The problems with Obama's loan guarantee program don't end there. The largest recipient of Obama's program to jumpstart green energy projects was the Spanish Company Abengoa, which took in $2.7 billion in loan guarantees for three of its projects. Other projects importing foreign-made solar panels are, much in the same way as Fisker Automotive, choosing to make their products overseas.</Msg><Username>agolferbogie</Username><Timestamp>1345740276000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 12:44:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345740592000-49</Id><Topic><Title>Dell expects slow Windows 8 demand in enterprise</Title><Username>phands_heretical2</Username><Timestamp>1345671476000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-22 17:37:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt;ever hear of the tablet and the smart phone&gt; ...has ms...? har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har har</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1345740592000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 12:49:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345740999000-50</Id><Topic><Title>Wottow says nearly all news stories are incorrect</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1345588362000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 18:32:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;Wottow says most news stories that he has knowledge of contain erroneous facts. 1: I guess wottow has little knowledge. 2: I guess wottow can find errors in all news. &gt; First, that's not what I said.

Fox has offered a mixed view of Romney, but its assessments of Obama's record and character have run true by a measure of six to one. The numbers are almost identical, in reverse, for MSNBC. Meanwhile, CNN has offered less about the campaign in general, but its coverage tends to resemble what audiences would find in the rest of the media. Squarely biased in favor of Obama. "The American news media in its coverage of the candidates appears increasingly to be a conduit of partisan rhetoric and less a source than it once was of independent reporting," PEJ Director Tom Rosenstiel said in a statement.

Maybe they think this will fix it? Probably a lot of people thought the old MS Office logo (or was it the Windows logo?) was the Microsoft logo. This change makes that true, sort of, by incorporating the essence of that logo into the corporate logo. At the same time, the Microsoft name is weakened and de-emphasized -- spelled in narrower strokes, a paler color, and above all not leaning forward. Regardless of what the designers and managers intend it to suggest, what it suggests to me is a circling of the wagons around Microsoft's long-time core products, Windows and Office, almost to the exclusion of anything else. http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/techflash/2012/08/microsoft-reveals-new-corporate-logo.html?ana=yfcpc Microsoft reveals new corporate logo Puget Sound Business Journal by Emily Parkhurst , Staff Writer Date: Thursday, August 23, 2012, 11:39am PDT View photo gallery (2 photos) Microsoft has a new logo. Microsoft has a new logo. Emily Parkhurst Staff Writer- Puget Sound Business Journal Email | Twitter | LinkedIn | Facebook Microsoft has a new logo. It’s simple. The four colored squares aren’t waving like a flag any more — they’re four solid colored blocks framed by white space that together look like a window. The word “Microsoft” is gray and in a sans serif font called Segoe, which Microsoft owns and has used in other marketing and branding work. It was the font used for Windows Vista. In a blog post, Microsoft's general manager of brand strategy, Jeffrey Meisner, wrote that the logo “takes its inspiration from our product design principles while drawing upon the heritage of our brand values, fonts and colors.” He went on to explain that the colored squares are intended to represent the different Microsoft products, like Windows (light blue), Xbox (green) and Office (orange). I’ve seen some criticism already that the logo font and color palate are similar to Google’s design, or that it’s not a particularly exciting look for a company that’s hoping to make a splash this fall with new devices and software launches. Others have praised the company for coming up with a clean, simple logo that conveys the company’s goal of bringing its products together.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345751027000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:43:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345751267000-84</Id><Topic><Title>Ouch!</Title><Username>b52boomer</Username><Timestamp>1345736035000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 11:33:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why do all old farts come here to bash MSFT?</Msg><Username>ltdjixas</Username><Timestamp>1345751267000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:47:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345751633000-85</Id><Topic><Title>Gavel to gavel coverage</Title><Username>k24chat</Username><Timestamp>1345749701000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:21:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Glenn Beck's GBTV will cover the Republican Convention, round the clock.</Msg><Username>ourfirstpantroglodytepresident</Username><Timestamp>1345751633000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:53:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345751791000-86</Id><Topic><Title>What's poignant MSFT into a Blazing Stock...</Title><Username>brady.mccormick42</Username><Timestamp>1345723709000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 08:08:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>An article that's worth a read.</Msg><Username>wright.reggie30</Username><Timestamp>1345751791000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 15:56:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345751862000-87</Id><Title>Did you see Big Lots today ?

In 2010, the spinning wheel stopped with the "Queen Ann I" trust under the pointer. Bain Capital Partners X is the vehicle through which CLear Channel was taken private in 2009 when its exclusively hate radio content model wasn't cutting it for a public company. The "partnership" and its various tentacles obviously survive and prove useful both for broadcasting the gospel of Mitt as well as funnelling money into Mitt's always soon to be retroactive retirement accounts. In the Bain Capital Partners X LLC and LP corporate pair, the scam is repeated, but with slightly greater opacity (Mitt's running for office, for Pete's sake) so the underlying of the options that Mitt has received through the "services' he's rendered at a zero strike and converted to "fair value" at zero dollars to push through his wife's "blind trust". Just as in the CC stripdown, there's no way for Mitt to "lose" anything in the process of sucking whatever former "industrial titan" dry, but at least in the CC scam, Mitt was throwing hate yackers into the wood chipper instead of steelworkers or medical diagnostic testing developers. That doesn't make Mitt anything less of a continuing Bain Capital principal, and not exactly as unconflicted in his financial interests as he had indicated to the FEC or even the MEC.</Msg><Username>truth_in_government</Username><Timestamp>1345766862000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 20:07:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345767034000-111</Id><Topic><Title>Wottow says nearly all news stories are incorrect</Title><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1345588362000</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-21 18:32:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&lt;His inability to grasp basic concepts is the root of most disagreements.&gt; That I can believe.

(Well, none on topic...) What's in a logo, anyway? Well, the logo is a statement by management to the general public about the company, how they see the company, how they would like the public to see the company, etc. Any statement that anyone makes says a lot more than what it says explicitly, and that is probably inevitable. For example, the mere fact that a statement was made at all, as opposed to no statement, conveys information. Choice of words, sentence structure (if the statement is verbal), vocal inflection (if the statement is oral), etc, all speak volumes. A logo is no different. So what is interesting about the logo is not only what the managers and designers MEANT to say, but what they did not mean to say, but could not help saying.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345770099000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:01:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345770610000-116</Id><Topic><Title>Look at This!</Title><Username>konstanceagx745</Username><Timestamp>1345734118000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 11:01:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Nice Post</Msg><Username>maitlandsof11129</Username><Timestamp>1345770610000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:10:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345771299000-117</Id><Topic><Title>msft new logo shows new purchase!!</Title><Username>clintelkins</Username><Timestamp>1345757158000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 17:25:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Over the long haul, Microsoft is a rock solid blue chip tech company that deserves ownership in any portfolio.</Msg><Username>dollar_dividend</Username><Timestamp>1345771299000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:21:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345772965000-118</Id><Title>Is Google the Real Tech King?</Title><Msg>Not really meaning to rattle the cage, jerk the chain of the softie shills. Well, maybe I do... The article compares the typical computer user a decade ago and today. I wasn't typical. I never used Internet Explorer if I could avoid it, but there were some few purposes for which I could not avoid it. I used Yahoo's search engine, and tried Google somewhat reluctantly, not knowing whether I could trust it. I soon found that when I did use Google, there was never a clear reason to go back to Yahoo. I liked the stark, no-nonsense front page, though I never bothered with the "Do You Feel Lucky?" button. I never used Hotmail and seldom Yahoo mail; the notion of a remote email service like those was alien. Email was something you did yourself, after registering with a nearby SMTP server. http://beta.fool.com/dsewrites/2012/08/23/google-real-tech-king/10095/?ticker=AAPL&amp;source=eogyholnk0000001 Is Google the Real Tech King? By Douglas Ehrman - August 23, 2012 | Tickers: AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, YHOO | 5 Comments Douglas is a member of The Motley Fool Blog Network -- entries represent the personal opinions of our bloggers and are not formally edited. While Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is setting records for the largest market capitalization in history, crossing the $623 billion threshold, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) may be quietly perching on the throne as the true king of technology. Despite Apple’s popularity as an iconic American brand and the near cult-like loyalty of many of its customers, Google’s Android has taken over as the leader in smartphones. The release of Google’s Nexus 7 tablet may be a first step toward domination in that market segment. Lastly, purchases of Frommer’s and Zagat have enhanced the company’s already dominant position in online search. Through dynamically expanding technology products and offerings, Google has become embedded in more and more of the things that most individuals do on a daily basis. If one remains unsure if this is true, all he or she needs to do is google it. An Integrated Solution If one reflects back on the last decade or so, it is easy to remember the days when things were a veritable smörgåsbord of applications from different providers. A typical computer user may have used Internet Explorer from Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to surf the web, may have used Yahoo’s (NASDAQ: YHOO) search engine and checked email through Hotmail or Yahoo mail. Those days have changed. First, Google showed that its search capabilities were so superior to rivals that there was a brief period during which the Yahoo home page carried the tag “powered by Google.” Second, Gmail unseated its rivals by offering an immense amount of free storage and creating a simple message at the bottom of every Gmail message sent inviting the recipient to get a free Gmail account. Finally, Google Chrome entered the picture and did the unthinkable -- the application not only surpassed IE as the most-used web browser, it has become the preference of many of the Apple faithful, despite the clean functionality of Apple’s Safari. Google Chrome is not available on the App Store for iPhone and iPad. One of the primary drivers of this success is the availability and simplicity of Google Apps – including, Docs, Calendar and other components. Google has not only seen widespread adoption of its platform by individuals, but government and corporate clients have made the migration as well. Just as Microsoft Office’s ability to integrate with other Microsoft products once made IE an obvious choice, the superior function and integration between Chrome and other Google components has been a driver of the browser’s popularity. The addition of integrated restaurant ratings through Zagat and other enhancements are helping Google to hold on to the lead that Microsoft once enjoyed....</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1345772965000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-23 21:49:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345773128000-119</Id><Title>need births to keep the country going ????</Title><Msg>Listening to an NPR interview this morning and the republican interview subject offered a comment in the context of the birth control / abortion issue.

Yes, in a rational country the state (government) needs new citizens to become workers and soldiers. Further, in a rational culture/civilization you need citizens of your type to maintain and promote your culture/civilization. **** &gt;&gt;&gt; Is it a political goal to increase population??? Yes. Within reason. Conversely, one of the problems with population reduction is similar to military disarmament. For example, if Country X reduces their population by 20% and their rival Country Y does not, in the future Country X may not be able to defend its borders against Country Y. *** &gt;&gt;&gt; If so the abortion and contraceptive issues can be seen in a new light.
